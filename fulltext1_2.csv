With the year and the NFL regular season coming to a close, The Back Page takes a look back at the ups and downs of Harvard alums in the big leagues. While some found success and others faltered, the Crimson made its mark on professional sports in 2012.
On the gridiron, Baltimore Ravens Center Matt Birk ‘98 is the only Harvard alum slated to make an appearance in the NFL postseason. After a 17-23 loss to the Bengals on Sunday, the Ravens will take on the Colts next Sunday in the AFC Wild Card Round. The Ravens finished atop the AFC North for the second straight year, ending the season with a 10-6 record despite losing four of their last five contests.
Birk made a splash off the field this season, coming out against gay marriage in an <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentaries/171850721.html"">editorial in the Minnesota Star Tribune. While some may take issue with his politics, Birk’s anchoring presence in the Ravens’ defensive line this season has been <a href=""http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/12/25/matt-birk-provides-stability-to-ravens-offense/"">undeniable. Before helping secure a playoff spot for his team, Birk was named a finalist for the 2013 Bart Starr Award, an honor bestowed by Athletes in Action to the NFL player who shows the strongest commitment to family and community as decided by a vote of NFL players.

In Buffalo, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 was unable to guide his team to the playoffs, and he might not get another chance. After failing to make the postseason for the 13th season in a row—the longest streak in the NFL—the Buffalo Bills have begun to jettison their staff. Among those already <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8795820/buffalo-bills-fire-chan-gailey-missing-playoffs-yet-again"">fired is coach Chan Gailey, who put up a 16-32 record in three losing seasons with the Bills.
It remains to be seen whether Fitzpatrick will remain the Bills’ starting quarterback in 2013, as <a href=""http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/12/24/report-it-seems-obvious-ryan-fitzpatrick-done-in-buffalo/"">rumors have been circulating all season about finding a replacement. After inking a six-year, $62 million contract last year, Fitzpatrick has failed to develop into the offensive catalyst the Bills’ front office had hoped he would. This season he finished 17th in the league in passing.
In addition to Jeremy Lin ’10’s success in the NBA, it was an exciting year for 2011-2012 men’s basketball captains Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ‘12, who each inked contracts to play professionally abroad. In Canada, point guard McNally leads the NBL in assists and assists per game for the Moncton Miracles. The Miracles hold a 10-11 record, good for third place in the Atlantic Division.
Overseas, forward Wright—who signed with Swedish team Uppsala in October—ranks second on the team in points per game, with 14.82. Entering the new year, Uppsala  sits in second place in the league, having won four of its last five contests.
With the NHL lockout reaching day 108, the NHL and the NHLPA <a href=""http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/12/31/nhl-lockout-league-union-expected-back-at-negotiating-table-after-three-week-hiatus/"">met in person today to resume negotiations after a three-week hiatus. Games have already been cancelled through mid-January—more than 50% of the season—and it remains to be seen whether the likes of Alex Killorn ’12 and Alex Biega ’10 will have a chance to play in the top league in 2013.

Well, we made it. The world didn’t end (even though Harvard men’s basketball fans might feel like it did), and the Crimson is back on the court and ice starting tomorrow, when the women’s basketball team hosts intrastate rival UMass to kick of a packed January schedule for Harvard sports. Now that we’re on the other side, let’s take a minute to reflect on the performances of 2012 and what teams should resolve to change going forward in 2013.
<a name=""jump"">
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Men’s Basketball:
While Monday night’s last-second loss to Saint Mary’s was frustrating, the Crimson led its favored opponent the entire game, surprising almost everyone in the audience. After holding the Gaels to a 22.6 field goal percentage in the first half, Harvard could not contain a reinvigorated St. Mary’s offense that shot 65.3 percent from the field in the second. With a relatively shallow bench and a starting five that rack up huge minutes each time out, the Crimson has struggled to stay consistent—especially on defense—for the full 40 minutes. If you’re Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, you have to be thinking defense, defense, defense.
Resolution: Tighten up post defense to avoid letting leads slip away late in the game.
&nbsp;
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Women’s Basketball:
With sophomore star Temi Fagbenle—who sat out her freshman season due to NCAA regulations—stepping up on offense, the team has made putting points on the board look easy. Fagbenle has scored in the double digits in her last four starts, and the team has also been aided by a consistent sophomore Christine Clark and confident senior Victoria Lippert, who led the team with 20 points in its loss to SMU Sunday. But no amount of points will compensate for sloppy ball handling, and indeed the Crimson has been plagued by turnovers that have led to quick points in transition for its opponents. Despite outscoring the Mustangs 38 to 24 in the paint, Harvard lost in part due to 20 costly turnovers that led to 30 points for SMU.
Resolution: Slow down the passing game and avoid unnecessary points off turnovers.
&nbsp;
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Men’s Hockey:
Last season the team topped the nation in power play goals, converting an impressive 27.3 percent of its opportunities. This year, that number has dropped to 7.7 percent, up from 6.1 after the Crimson scored its only goal against Northeastern with the advantage in a 5-1 loss last weekend. With its touted penalty kill absent during the last two games—down to 50 percent against UMass and 25 percent against the Huskies—failing to convert power play opportunities is a recipe for disaster for the Crimson.
Resolution: Take advantage of power play opportunities to put easy points on the board.
&nbsp;
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Women’s Hockey:
With only one loss so far this season and a perfect conference record, the No. 4 women’s hockey team looks hard to beat. Returning to the ice on Jan. 4 for the first time since early December, it remains to be seen whether the Crimson—undefeated in its last seven games—can keep up its current hot streak. But, with Harvard’s deadly combination of senior Laura Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer in the net—ranked first and third in goaltending nationally—combined with 16th leading scorer Jillian Dempsey, the second half of the season looks nothing but promising.
Resolution: With a marathon second half schedule—18 games in less than two months—stay healthy and injury free.

Mistakes proved costly for the Harvard women's basketball team as it fell, 88-73, to Southern Methodist University on Sunday during the consolation round of the Surf 'N Slam Classic at San Diego State's Viejas Arena. The Crimson (7-5) gave up a combined 50 points off turnovers and free throws en route to a loss at the hands of the Mustangs (9-4).In the first-ever meeting between the teams, it was SMU junior Keena Mays who ran the floor for the afternoon, putting up a game-high 25 points. Mays, who transferred from Kansas at the beginning of the year, was followed by fellow guard, senior Alisha Filmore, who notched 22 points. Junior forward Akil Simpson closed out the power trio of scoring with 15 points for the night. No player on either team recorded a double-double.The Crimson shot at 49 percent from the field, led by senior guard Victoria Lippert and her team-high 20 points. The San Diego native drilled a perfect five-of-five from behind the arc, a new career high. Against No. 14/13 Oklahoma State on Friday night, Lippert was held to just one three the entire night out of her six attempts.[Lippert] is the type of player that can give us a big spark offensively and she was able to do that,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “She had some big shots at very key times. [Lippert] can hit shots when you need her to hit shots and that's what she did tonight.... She created some energy for us that was lacking.""Three other Harvard players saw double digit scoring. Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle put up 16 points and led the effort on against the glass, grabbing eight rebounds and four blocks, both game-highs. Guards Christine Clark and Ali Curtis scored 11 and 12 points, respectively. Clark led the Ivy League in scoring at the start of this weekend, with an average of 16.6 points per contest. Golen entered the game at the top of the nation in three-point percentage, hitting 66 percent behind the arc, but missed all four attempts during the match-up.
The game started well for the Crimson, who jumped to an early lead with a pair of jumpers from Clark and Fagbenle in the first minute of play. A trey from Lippert brought Harvard up on the Mustangs, 7-6, and a trio of layups by Fagbenle and Curtis led the Crimson to its final lead of the day, 13-10, five and a half minutes into the game. A Mays three tied the contest and from there, SMU would never trail Harvard.After powerful shooting from Lippert tied the game again at 23-all, the Mustangs went on a 14-2 run over the next four minutes that allowed the team to head into the locker room with a 10 point advantage. In the second period, SMU eventually stretched their lead to as much as 20 points with just over five minutes remaining in the game.“I think we hung with them in the first half and felt pretty confident going into the second half, but we kind of fell apart in the second half,” Golen said. “They were just hitting in transition. They hit some tough shots and they hit some pretty good shots. We couldn't hang on and get the defensive shots we needed.”Errors were particularly fatal for the Crimson. 20 Harvard turnovers gave way to 30 points for the Mustangs, who shot at 76.9 percent from the charity stripe, netting 20 points.“Turnovers are a thing we're always constantly focusing on and trying to reduce in each of our games,” Curtis said. “The other team was very in our face and very good at pressuring defensively so I think offensively we have to be ready to expect that and be on the attack instead of back on our heels.”Turnovers were also a common theme in the heartbreaking overtime loss to Boston Universty in Dec. 10. 22 were committed as the Crimson fell to the Terriers, 68-61.The loss is the third straight for Harvard. The Crimson squad has not held a three-game losing streak since the very beginning of last season.“I thought overall, we learned a lot from playing such a good opponent,” Curtis said. “It really got us prepared for Ivy League [games] coming up.”-Staff writer Cordelia F.

Perhaps overshadowed by the Harvard men’s basketball team’s collapse to St. Mary’s was the strong play of sophomore forward Jonah Travis.Making his sixth career start, Travis scored a game-high 19 points—matching a career high—on just 10 shots.“It was amazing,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said of the sophomore’s performance. “I thought he played his butt off.”Travis scored nine points in the first 8:24 of play, helping the Crimson jump out to a 16-12 advantage over the heavily favored Gaels.Before it was all said and done, Travis had added 10 more points and finished the game shooting 8 of 10 from the field.
Travis was quick to credit the play of sophomore Wesley Saunders and freshman Siyani Chambers—the Crimson’s first and second leading scorers this season, respectively—for his success.“I can kind of hide in the shadows a little bit,” Travis said. “I’m not always the focal point of the scouting report, so when [Saunders and Chambers are] having success, usually that allows me to have some breakout games.”But after picking up two fouls in the first half, Travis struggled with foul trouble in the second period. And after picking up his fourth foul with 3:36 to play, Travis was sent to the bench with 2:26 remaining and the Crimson clinging to a six-point lead.Travis returned to the game with 2:08 to go after St. Mary’s pulled within four and eventually fouled out with 1.1 seconds remaining.“We missed not having him in there with foul trouble and then we fouled out at the end,” Amaker said.Travis finished with a total of 24 minutes on the court. Sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi replaced Travis and finished with eight points on three-of-seven shooting and four rebounds.His eight points marked Moundou-Missi’s second highest offensive output of the season.BIG DIn addition to his 14 points, Saunders also contributed on the defensive end.For 40 minutes, the 6’5” wing covered Saint Mary’s top scorer, senior point guard Matthew Dellavedova. Dellavedova, who entered the contest averaging 18.5 points per game, was held to four points—a season low—on 1-of-13 shooting from the field.

""December 24th, 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. From here on out I shoot without a script."" Mark, an amateur filmmaker and one of the main characters in ""Rent,"" begins the musical with a reflection on the beginning of the end of the 20th century, in which New York City’s young artists struggled to find meaning in their lives despite poverty and disease. Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of ""Rent"" ran in the OBERON from December 6 to December 12 and included many bold staging and lighting choices. Director Anna G. Kelsey '14 had to work with the unconventional stage organization at the OBERON, and made decisions that brought nuance to an often-performed musical. However, these choices seemed to enhance the cast’s energy and the end result was a production that remained true to Jonathan Larson’s original characters.The vocal talent of the ensemble cast was the most impressive aspect of the show. Vocal execution is essential to any staging of ""Rent"" because the rock opera’s ballads are its heart and soul, and a substantial number of songs involve collaboration between characters. One particularly successful vocal pairing was that of Mark (Jacob A. Brandt '14) and his friend Roger (Berklee student Jake Ohlbaum). Their ""What You Own"" was great not only because they have excellent voices, but because each was able to rely on the other for timing and onstage chemistry. Every scene with Mark and Roger flowed very well, and the two actors were able to give and take energy and presence from each other.Equally impressive were the numbers that brought together the majority or entirety of the cast, most notably ""Will I?"" and ""Seasons Of Love."" Music directors Mark R. Parker '12-'13 and Kyra A. Atekwana '14 coached the ensemble pieces to precision which made both of these renditions startling and touching. This is not to say that individual cast members did not stand out in certain pieces. Though the strong harmonies and clear vocals were impressive in and of themselves, it was the solo vocals of Kimberly A. M. Onah '15 in ""Seasons of Love"" that made the collaborative piece truly outstanding. The notes Onah proved able to hit made her stand out from the group harmonies, which were fantastic in their own right.Kelsey's cast gave the show everything they had, and their sustained energy carried the show from start to finish. In every aspect of the performance, the actors were incredibly well timed—the cast kept up relentless dancing and singing despite the length of the show and remained in sync for complicated routines like the dance segments in ""Tango: Maureen"" and ""Contact."" The cast’s energy in the bigger numbers was incredible, as was especially evident in ""La Vie Boheme,"" the table-stomping, fist-pumping crown jewel of the production.OBERON's stage was the perfect home for this production. Instead of amphitheater-like seating, the club seats the audience at round tables interspersed throughout the room, which allowed the actors to move about the audience. Kelsey succeeded in finding innovative ways to use the layout of the OBERON to her advantage. In the opening number, disgruntled tenants were able to run and twirl in the aisles while others took to the balconies to roar their discontent. In fact, Kelsey staged a fair amount of action on the balconies of the club, which gave the audience multiple perspectives from which they could view the actors. Kelsey and choreographer Sofie A. R. Seymour '15 deserve an enormous amount of credit for adapting the musical to this unconventional set-up so well.
The OBERON’s club atmosphere also came in handy in the lighting for some of the pieces. During ""Christmas Bells,"" a light directed at the giant disco ball simulated snow. While many of the choices might have seemed out of place in a different production of ""Rent,"" the lighting brought nuance to this version of the musical and made the production as a whole vibrant and fresh. Yasmeen E. Audi '15 played the spirited Mimi whose solo piece, ""Out Tonight,"" was bolder and livelier as a result of the colorful pulsing lights that reflected off of the many mirrors of the disco club. In ""Contact,"" the sexual energy radiated off of the stage as glaring red lights highlighted the writhing and grinding bodies seeking release.Due to the director’s nuanced staging and lighting choices, the lighting additions and fragmented staging did not detract from the poignancy of Larson's original characters. It was the energy of the actors and the power of their singing that ensured that the spirit of the musical remained. Larson's lyrics and characters are still relevant today, and the enormously talented director and cast made sure that this classic could not have been anything less than excellent.

Good news, Harvard foodies: a recently shuttered iconic eatery in the Square will soon have a new occupant.Local chef Michael Scelfo plans to open his own establishment in the space on Brattle Street previously occupied by the Mediterranean restaurant Casablanca, Boston Magazine reported last week.Casablanca, a beloved gathering place for Harvard professors and other affiliates since its founding as a bar in 1955, was <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/13/casablanca-restaurant-sale/"">put up for sale in 2011. It closed its doors for good last month.<!--more-->Scelfo, currently the executive chef at Russell House Tavern, has spent four years working with the Grafton Group, which also oversees Temple Bar, Grafton Street, and Park. 
""They are great people,"" Scelfo said of his Grafton Group colleagues. ""And I’ve learned quite a bit from them."" Yet Scelfo said he is excited to take a new step in his career, adding that opening his own restaurant will ""fulfill a lifelong dream."" Scelfo said he can report no further details of his plans at this point, but will release more information in the coming months.When Casablanca went up for sale in 2011, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson told The Crimson she was hopeful that the vacated space would reopen its doors.“Recently, a Boston Globe column talked about the re-opening of Bob Slate Stationer and referred to it as ‘a miracle on Brattle Street.’ We look forward to a second miracle,” Jillson said at the time.Here's hoping Scelfo's restaurant becomes as much of a fixture in Harvard Square as Casablanca.

After a 2012 regular season that began with playoff hype but ended with the Buffalo Bills posting a 6-10 record for the third time in four years, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 heads into the offseason with an organization facing more questions than answers. Although Fitzpatrick signed a seven year contract valued at more than $60 million dollars with the Bills last season, with the head coach that developed him—Chan Gailey—gone, his future with the organization is in doubt. Looking both at the franchise and the current free agency situation around the NFL, The Back Page offers a look at where Fitzpatrick could be playing next year.
<a name=""jump"">
On the Bills’ side of things:
In his fifth season starting ten or more games, Fitzmagic posted the second-highest completion percentage of his career and matched his career high with 24 touchdown strikes. However, he had 24 turnovers and his QBR (an advanced metric valuing quarterback performance that takes into consideration game situations and quality of opponents) was the lowest since his first year on the Bills. For his career, Fitzpatrick has never led a team to a record north of .500 and has committed 19 or more turnovers in each of the past three seasons. However, he has thrown for over 3,000 yards in three straight seasons and has been a dramatic improvement over previous Bills turnover machines Trent Edwards and J.P. Losman.
Gailey was often Fitzpatrick’s biggest supporter but was let go by the organization on Monday. Remaining is general manager Buddy Nix, who signed off on Fitzpatrick’s contract but last week said, “We need a good, young quarterback, and we’re going to do our best to get him.” While the Bills hold the eighth pick in the draft, teams with more dubious quarterback situations draft ahead of them. The first three picks in the draft go to the Chiefs, the Jaguars, and the Raiders—none of which has a convincing future at the position. Directly ahead of the Bills are the Browns and Cardinals, two more teams that could use another quarterback prospect. In a draft with weak quarterback prospects—headliners Matt Barkley, Mike Glennon, and Geno Smith struggled late in the year with inconsistent play and injuries—the Bills may opt to take another year of Fitzpatrick rather than hemorrhage picks to trade up and select a quarterback without the potential of last year’s RG3 or Andrew Luck.
Fitzpatrick’s large contract includes $24 million in guaranteed money and drafting another quarterback would be tantamount to acknowledging such a large contract was a mistake and eating the money. After splurging and giving defensive ends Kyle Williams Mario Williams $67 million in guaranteed money last year, the Bills would be strapped for cash if they took to free agency to find a high-priced veteran option like Michael Vick so the draft is likely their only option. For those reasons, although Fitzpatrick likely will not have the same rapport with the next Bills coach, the huge contract ensures the Bills likely have thrown in their lot with Fitzpatrick for 2013.
&nbsp;
If he leaves…:
Although a trade for Fitzpatrick would be hard to pull off or justify—his contract would be a large burden for a team to take on for a starter that hasn’t yet lived up to it—Nix may decide cutting the Amish Rifle is worth the risk. Various general managers have tied their futures to young quarterbacks—Bill Polian in Indianapolis (Peyton Manning) and Bruce Allen in Washington (RG3) are two good examples—and Nix may try to save his job by taking a flier on Barkley or Smith. If Nix were fired before the draft, Fitzpatrick would be left without the general manager or coach that brought him into the fold and could be left out in the cold.
If Fitzpatrick is released, he could sign a significantly smaller contract as a starter for a team looking for a short-term fill like the Chiefs or Cardinals (a la what Chad Henne did this year for the Jaguars). He would provide an upgrade to their current situation while not forcing them to draft a quarterback in a year where the draft is stronger at other positions. The Amish Rifle could also land as a low-priced backup on teams with little depth at that position like Cincinnati (current using Bruce Gradkowski), Oakland (Terrelle Pryor), or San Diego (Charlie Whitehurst).
&nbsp;
Future prospects:
Although Nix’s rhetoric is strong and he threatens to trade up to draft Fitzpatrick’s replacement, the Bills spent heavily last offseason and should be reluctant to make their $60 million acquisition a backup or even cut him without a sure alternative. Before tailing off at the end of the year, Fitzpatrick had thrown 15 touchdowns against only eight picks and the team was a game out of first in the AFC East through seven games. The combination of a weak draft and huge contract will likely end with Fitzmagic staying for one more season in Buffalo. If he leaves, as a 30-year old on the downswing of his career, the Amish Rifle is unlikely to get longer than a two-year contract from a team looking for a stopgap or low-priced backup who has already proved his leadership ability in the league.

UPDATED: January 5, 2013, at 10:37 a.m.Over the past nearly four decades, there have been few constants in the Winthrop House community. David D. Simms Jr., Winthrop’s superintendent and building manager for 38 years, was one of them.Simms, who held the post since October 1974, died at Mount Auburn Hospital on Dec. 28 after suddenly falling ill in his office the week before. He was 65.An email thread over the House list that began after the House Masters announced that he had been hospitalized tells story after story about how “Mr. Simms”—as he was known to the House community—had affected many members of the House in different ways. Usually, it was the small things they remembered—the times he gladly gave them a spare key when they were locked out of their rooms or went to great lengths to ensure that incoming mail packages efficiently reached their owners.Undergraduates who had built personal relationships with Simms or worked with him remembered Simms as someone who, without fail, cared deeply about each student who passed through Winthrop House.
“He wanted to make sure that there wasn’t a student who came to the office and couldn’t get what they needed there,” said Alexis C. Gomez ’13, a Winthrop resident and Dorm Crew head captain who had worked closely with Simms.Sitting in his office on the first floor of G-entryway with his door open, Simms would greet each person who walked past with an unmistakably warm “How you doin’?” He would then strike up a conversation and listen to students talk about their successes and struggles.“You’re in the middle of exams. It’s winter. It’s cold. It’s dark. He’d make a joke—something about the news—he’d crack a joke, and you’d laugh,” said Jonathan M. Padilla ’12, a former Winthrop House resident who would frequently stop by Simms’s office to discuss politics and current events. “We needed the two to three minutes of humor a day to keep us sane.”Sometimes, Simms would share his own stories as well—stories about Texas, where he went every summer to visit his extended family and indulge in warm weather and Southern barbecue. He told students that before coming to Harvard, he was a veteran of the U.S. Army who had served a tour in Vietnam, and that on the weekends he worked a second job as a guard for Eastern Security at the Longy School of Music of Bard College.“He loved every one of those students,” said Mary A. Simms, Simms’s wife. She recalled that her husband would come home every day and talk about his work. “No two days were the same because it was always an adventure. Something always happened.”For Winthrop students, Simms was the man to turn to when that something happened amid the hustle and bustle of academic and residential life. When the radiator stopped working or the roof started to leak, Simms would call for backup immediately. When a package arrived from home, Simms already had the student’s mailbox number memorized. When students forgot to put their boxes into storage in the spring or needed help removing them in the fall, Simms was there.“He worked all of his time, and he never really asked for anything for himself,” said Zachary H. Goldberg ’14, who worked for Simms as a building manager assistant.Raul A. Campillo ’09, a Winthrop resident tutor who also lived in the House and worked for Simms as an undergraduate, put it another way.“He really understood that Winthrop House was everyone’s home away from home,” Campillo said. “He was synonymous with the House.”Mary Simms said that in recent years, she would ask her husband when he would finally leave Harvard. Each time, Simms would say that “next year” he would retire and return to Texas, but “next year” never seemed to come. Even in the few months before he died, Simms repeatedly told her that 2013 would be the year.“He was one of the longest serving building managers at Harvard—someone who clearly wasn’t doing it because he made fantastic money or because he wanted it to be some platform to some other position,” said Alexander G. Smith ’15, the current Dorm Crew captain of Winthrop House. “He really genuinely enjoyed the company of the students in Winthrop and was someone who, at the end of the day, cared about the well-being of the students.”A funeral will be held on Friday morning at the Mount Olive Kingdom Builders Worship Center in Boston. Visitation begins at 10 a.m., and the service begins at 11 a.m.Simms is survived by his wife Mary, his daughters Charlyne and Michele, his son David D. Simms III, and his grandchildren David D. Simms IV, Mickai D. L. Simms, and Lia A. Monteiro.—Staff writer Xi Yu can be reached at xyu@college.harvard.edu.

The Harvard men’s basketball team would like nothing more than to leave 2012 in the past. After losing on a last-second game-winner against Saint Mary’s on New Years Eve, the Crimson will look to make a fresh start in 2013 when it hosts Rice on Saturday.Co-captain Christian Webster is the only Harvard player remaining from the last time the Crimson (7-5) took on the Owls (3-9) in 2009. The guard—then a freshman—dropped 10 points in an 85-64 blowout by a starting five that included Jeremy Lin ’10 and last season’s co-captains, Oliver McNally and Keith Wright.After tinkering with Harvard’s starting lineup for the first six games of the season, coach Tommy Amaker has settled on a starting five which is led by freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore forward Wes Saunders. Chambers and Saunders, who have started every game this season, top the team with 12.5 and 15.8 points per game, respectively.Saunders has scored in the double digits every game this season, and he credits Chambers—who averages 5.7 assists per game—for creating offensive opportunities.“Siyani had confidence in me even in the first half when I wasn’t knocking down shots,” said Saunders, following an 18-point performance in last week’s upset victory over California. “He kept coming to me, and so I was able to knock down some shots, and my teammates put me in the right position.”
Joining Chambers and Saunders in the starting lineup are Webster, junior guard Laurent Rivard, and sophomore Forward Jonah Travis.“That’s been our best lineup,” said Amaker after the Cal game. “We’ve stuck with that now for a few games, and I like the rhythm it’s given our team. We space the floor well, and when we get some post production that really adds to the balance of our team.”After failing to score in double digits in the previous four games, Travis was dominant in the paint against Saint Mary’s, putting up a season-high 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting from the field.In addition to creating opportunities on offense, defense will be crucial as the Crimson takes on an Owls team led by senior Tamir Jackson. The guard—who is the only Rice player returning from the 2009 matchup—averages 17.6 points per game with 6.7 rebounds. Following Jackson is sophomore guard Julian DeBose, who adds 9.5 points per game.While the Owls’ two top scorers are starters, the team has also been able to take advantage of a strong bench. Three bench players are averaging more than five points per game, led by Junior guard Austin Ramljak with 7.7.In twelve games, the Owls have been outmatched offensively across the board. They are shooting 39 percent from the field to Harvard’s 46.3 and averaging 57.9 points per game to the Crimson’s 68.3.Despite the statistical mismatch, Harvard will have to contain Jackson in order to shut down the Owl’s offense. In the matchup against Cal, Amaker looked to Saunders to defend the Bears’ top scorer, junior guard Allen Crabbe. Saunders credits his teammates with helping slow his opponent down.“Obviously I knew [Crabbe] was going to make some tough shots,” Saunders said. “But I mean it was just a team effort defending him. My teammates had my back whenever I got caught.”In turning the page in the New Year, Harvard will look to cut down on costly mistakes that sealed its fate against Saint Mary’s. The Crimson led until the last second, but a couple of missed rebounds and shots from the stripe made the difference down the stretch as the Gaels chipped away at Harvard’s lead through the second half.“We made too many critical mistakes with handling the basketball and not making foul shots… which is what wins you close games, especially when you’re up,” Amaker said after the loss.“The intensity that we brought in the first half just wasn’t there in the second half, and I don’t know what it was,” Travis added. “I think we might have just gotten too comfortable.”The Owls enter the contest having lost their last two against TCU and Texas. Rice has yet to put together back-to-back victories this season.A win against the Owls would put the Crimson back on track after snapping its three game win streak—the longest of the season—to end its California road trip. The matchup is Harvard’s last non-conference game before the start of Ivy League play when Harvard travels to take on Dartmouth on Jan. 12.

After a back-and-forth first quarter that ended with the Hornets up by one, the basement-dwellers of the Western Conference looked to steal one on the road from Jeremy Lin ’10 and the Houston Rockets. But a 25-foot jumper from Lin in the very next frame capped off a 12-5 Rockets run that saw the final lead change of the game.
Lin recorded nine points and seven assists as the Houston Rockets took their second straight in a 104-92 win over the New Orleans Hornets Wednesday night.
<a name=""jump"">Although New Orleans (7-25) briefly tied the game midway through the fourth quarter, Houston (18-14) never fell behind after taking the lead in the second. The Rockets finished strong, outscoring the Hornets in each of the final two periods to hand New Orleans its 13th road loss of the season in 16 away games.
Houston’s James Harden led all scorers with 31 points for his 11th 30-plus point performance of the season. Teammate Omer Asik put down 21 points of his own while rookie Patrick Patterson added 15 points off the bench.
Lin logged a game-high 42 minutes and shot 3-for-10 from the field.
“I’m feeling good,” Lin said after his fourth straight 40-plus-minute game. “Tonight was a tougher one. Shots weren’t falling, so it was an uglier one.”
As the regular season nears its midway point, Houston clings to the sixth spot in the Western Conference. Two games separate the Rockets from the ninth-place Minnesota Timberwolves in a tightening playoff picture.

Congressional lawmakers reached an eleventh-hour deal late Tuesday to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, largely postponing what will likely be far-reaching spending cuts expected to cost Harvard and other research universities millions of dollars in federal sponsorship. The bill allows the top marginal tax rate to rise to 39.6 percent on individuals earning at least $400,000 and families earning more than $450,000, but avoids universal tax increases as well as automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that would have taken effect Wednesday had the legislation not passed. Such cuts would have slashed billions from the federal budget in the coming year alone and <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/30/sequestration-research-budget-cuts/"">left a large hole in Harvard’s balance sheets. Temporarily postponed but still looming is sequestration, which would result in automatic, across-the-board reductions in spending of 8.2 percent for nondefense programs and 9.4 percent for defense programs. Those cuts include millions of dollars in research funding earmarked for Harvard and other institutions for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, 2012. 
 Last fiscal year, the University received around $650 million in federal sponsorship—a figure which accounted for about 16 percent of Harvard’s entire operating budget, according to the Office for Sponsored Programs 2012 <a href=""http://osp.fad.harvard.edu/sites/osp.fad.harvard.edu/files/attachments/99/annual-report-12.12.12.pdf"">annual report. The postponement of sequestration means that Congress now has until March 1 to reach a broader spending deal to avert the automatic cuts. Such a deal would likely be part of a larger federal debate over the debt ceiling by the new Congress, which is set to be sworn in Thursday. Harvard, which actively lobbies in Washington, will likely continue its efforts to preserve research funding in any future deal. The University did not return requests for comment on Tuesday's deal. University President Drew G. Faust has said in the past that Harvard might look to private sponsorship to help fill any gap that may emerge from a decrease in federal funding. While Tuesday’s deal largely dealt with questions of federal revenue, the final bill does call for some discretionary cuts to be split between defense and nondefense programs. Whether or not those initial cuts will affect research funding is uncertain. Harvard receives significant funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense, among other programs. Less than an hour after the House of Representatives passed the measure, President Barack Obama spoke from the White House, thanking Congressional leaders and Vice President Joe Biden for their work on the agreement. He also looked ahead to the looming debt battles, warning that the country must take a balanced approach to further spending cuts as it seeks to avoid hitting the debt ceiling in the future.  “We can’t simply cut our way to prosperity,” Obama <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/01/statement-president-tax-agreement"">said Tuesday night. “We can’t keep cutting things like basic research and new technology and still expect to succeed in a 21st-century economy.”—Staff writer Nicholas P.

Former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren took the oath of office at noon Thursday, becoming the first woman to ever serve Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate.She, along with seven other Democrats, three Republicans, and one independent, is part of the 12-member freshmen class joining the 113th Congress as it convenes for the first time Thursday. Democrats will maintain a majority in the Senate as the battle over federal debt continues in the coming months.<!--more-->Warren defeated U.S. Senator Scott Brown last November in what was one of the most closely-watched Senate races in the country. She comes to Washington after a long career in academia, where she rose through the ranks to become a leading expert on consumer finance law and one of the most popular professors at the Law School.The intellectual force behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren is not new to Washington. Though she arrives in the capitol with baggage heavier than many of her fellow freshmen in the Senate, Warren has already parleyed her high profile into a key appointment to the Senate Banking Committee.
She takes the seat of Brown, a Republican who served in Washington for two years after replacing longtime Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 in 2010. Brown is expected to announce his candidacy to fill the seat of fellow Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry, who will leave the Senate if confirmed as Secretary of State.Democratic Congressman Edward J. Markey, who represents the majority of Harvard's Cambridge-based campus, has already <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/27/markey-special-senate-kerry/"">announced his own bid for the seat.

After a one-and-a-half month stretch since its last conference game, the Harvard men’s hockey team will resume ECAC play with two road matchups against Princeton and Quinnipiac this weekend.The Crimson (4-5-1, 3-3 ECAC) currently sits in ninth place in the conference, but the team still has 16 league games remaining to make up ground.Although the Harvard offense started the season hot and racked up at least three goals in five of its first seven games, the Crimson has struggled to produce much scoring in its recent matchups.Harvard has not found the back of the net more than twice on a night since its last win, which came against Cornell Nov. 16. The team is coming off a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Northeastern at Bright Hockey Center.The Crimson will travel to New Jersey to take on the Tigers on Friday. Princeton (3-7-4, 2-3-3) is going through a rough stretch, having failed to achieve a victory in its last seven outings.
The Tigers are led by junior forward Andrew Calof and sophomore forward Tyler Maugeri, both of whom have amassed a team-high 16 points this year.The Harvard penalty-killing unit will look to continue Princeton’s struggles on the power play, as the Tigers have converted only two of its last 16 opportunities on the man-advantage.Princeton and the Crimson have matched up relatively evenly in recent years, and the two squads battled to 4-3 outcomes twice last year, with each team winning one.After the showdown with the Tigers, Harvard will wrap up the weekend against Quinnipiac (14-3-2, 8-0) in Hamden, Conn. The Bobcats have been playing some of their best hockey of the year recently. After going 3-4-1 to begin the season, Quinnipiac has gone undefeated since, winning 11 of its last 12 games with one tie.The Bobcats have achieved success in part because of their sound defensive play. Quinnipiac ranks second in the ECAC with only six power-play goals allowed all season, and senior goaltender Eric Hartzell leads the conference with a 1.43 goals against average.The Crimson will need to contain senior forward Jeremy Langlois, who has spearheaded the Bobcats’ offense throughout the season and has accounted for a team-high 20 points.Quinnipiac handily disposed of Princeton when the two teams faced off on consecutive days in early December by scores of 3-1 and 3-0.Harvard’s penalty kill as of late has lacked the intensity that characterized it earlier this season. In its first eight games of the year, the Crimson allowed opponents to score only two goals on power plays. But in its last two games, Harvard has surrendered five goals while down a man.After sitting atop the ECAC in penalty killing percentage for much of the season, the Crimson finds itself ranked eighth in the conference at 82.1 percent entering Friday’s game.Harvard has not won since mid-November, and the team will need to hold its opponents to low scores this weekend if it hopes to start the new year off on the right foot.—Staff writer David Steinbach can be reached at dsteinbach@college.harvard.edu

On a night when junior guard Christine Clark eclipsed 1,000 career points, the Harvard women’s basketball team coasted to an easy victory, 85-59, over the University of Massachusetts in Cambridge.The Crimson (8-5) was dominant from start to finish, as the Minutewomen (2-12) never once held the lead throughout the contest.“I’m very pleased,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We were in dire need of a win, and I thought everyone did a really nice job. It was a good win for us tonight, with [Clark] hitting a pretty amazing milestone that we’re proud of.”The win snapped a three-game Crimson losing streak, the squad’s longest of the year. Harvard’s 85 points scored and the 26-point margin of victory represented its highest marks of the season.The Crimson produced consistent offense in the opening half and led, 48-29, at the break. Harvard put the game out of reach over the span of six minutes early in the second frame, scoring 12 straight points to take a 31-point lead.
The team shot just over 50% from the field (33-of-64) to maintain its first-place Ivy League rank in field goal percentage.Clark entered the game 12 points shy of 1,000, and she reached the mark early in the second half on a free throw. Despite inserting herself into a group that includes only 18 other players in the history of the program, the milestone was apparently far from Clark’s mind during the game.“I think that it’s such a prestigious club to be a part of, so I’m very honored,” Clark said. “I didn’t even know [that I reached 1,000], actually. They announced it during a timeout, and I was just like, ‘Oh, really? Okay.’ ”The junior was not done, however, and she went on to score seven of the next nine Crimson points to register a game-high of 19 before Delaney-Smith took her out to give younger players some time on the floor.“[Clark] went in spurts, I would say, but at a time when we needed some spunk, she ran the floor,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s the kind of player she is, so I was very happy for her and pretty pleased with the effort.”Harvard received a boost from junior center Elise Gordon, who came off the bench to score 14 points, her career-high, in as many minutes on an efficient 7-of-8 from the field.“[Gordon’s performance] was wonderful; she did great,” Delaney-Smith said. “I know she has that in her, and she knows she has that in her…. She’s very capable of that, night in and night out.”Senior guard Victoria Lippert, the only other active member of the Crimson in the 1,000-point club, also spearheaded the Harvard attack. Lippert racked up buckets throughout the game to finish with 17 points on 6-of-11 shooting.Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle only missed one shot all night to contribute 12 points and a team-high six rebounds. The British Olympian has reached double figures in six of her last seven games.UMass, which struggled to keep up with Harvard offensively, was led by freshman guard Nola Henry and junior forward Kiara Bomben, the team’s only players to reach double figures with 15 and 11 points, respectively.

While many of us have been relaxing during our winter break, freshman forward Jimmy Vesey of the Harvard men’s hockey team has been busy on the ice with the U.S. National Junior Team at the 2013 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship in Ufa, Russia.
After two exhibition matches before Christmas, USA finished 2-2 in pool play, routing Germany, 8-0, and Slovakia, 9-3, while falling to Russia, 2-1, and Canada, 2-1.<a name=""jump"">
Vesey tallied three assists in the game against Slovakia on New Years Eve.
Having qualified for the playoff round after finishing third in its group with six points in pool play, the Americans defeated the Czech Republic, 7-0, in the quarterfinals.
On Thursday, USA faced off against rival Canada in the semifinals, who had finished undefeated in pool play.
The Americans jumped out to an early lead with two goals in the first period, then another in the third before the freshman forward from Harvard struck to make it 4-0.
Vesey netted his first goal of the tournament, receiving a pass from teammate John Gaudreau of Boston College streaking along the right side, and then beating Canadian goalie Malcolm Subban, cutting the puck across to the left and burying it into the net above the stick side.
USA will face Sweden in the Gold Medal Game Saturday at 8 a.m, the first matchup in the finals between the two squads in tournament history.

Lee '02, Professor of Hygiene, and his assistants during the past year, and on the whole, the reports show a satisfactory undergraduate health record. Of these, of course, many were reexaminations, but those of the 903 incoming freshmen present some striking features.<!--more-->For one thing the smoking habit does not seem to be so prevalent in the Class of 1927. Each year statistics have been collected in regard to the number of men who smoke, and although these figures may not be absolutely correct, they are at least comparatively accurate. 32.5 percent of this year's freshman class are smokers while the percentage in 1921 was 48 percent and in 1922 was 37 percent. There is probably some slight tendency to a decrease in smoking due to an increased participation in athletic exercises. In one of the graduate schools, 53 percent of the men smoke as compared with 54 percent in 1921 and 65 percent in 1922. At a rough estimate slightly over half of the College students are tobacco users by the time they graduate.January 4, 1934: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1934/1/4/beer-ale-served-in-dining-halls/"">Beer, Ale Served in Dining Halls After 100 Years
Beer flowed legally in the dining halls yesterday for the first time in over 100 years. Two brands of beer and one of ale were offered to students over 21, seated at special tables. The Business School and Medical School were deprived however of the privilege because the University has not as yet procured a license for them.This unprecedented action was the result of an announcement made December 20 by the Corporation that it would apply for licenses permitting the sale of malt beverages in the Houses. The Corporation's decision to apply for licenses followed long agitation that began last April when the 3.2 beer bill was passed and continued through to its climax some weeks ago when several students brought wine into the dining halls and some Houses voted in favor of having beer served.January 5, 1943: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1943/1/5/yardling-invents-face-saving-mask-pif-a/"">Yardling Invents Face-Saving MaskIf a large enough market seems likely to present itself, a dazzlingly different type of headgear, practical and picturesque, may soon be manufactured on a grand scale by Glen O. Martin '46 of Joplin, Missouri, and Weld Hall. The new device which will soon be a must in every student's wardrobe, according to Martin, is called the Little Dandy Umbreller-Repeller, and really seems to be a marvel of simple efficiency.Martin conceived the idea of his invention when, during a recent rainy spell, he found himself beset on all sides by determined females wielding the sharp points of their umbrellas with deadly efficacy, so much so, in fact, that he claims he was forced to cower for an hour in a convenient doorway till the rush hour passed. Fervently he wished for some sort of apparatus which would protect him reasonably well from the all too accurate thrusts of the parasol brigadiers, so when he arrived back at his little den in Weld he set to work on the plans of his brainchild.January 5, 1956: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1956/1/5/alumnus-quits-council-objects-to-oppenheimer/"">Alumnus Quits Council, Objects to OppenheimerThe Class of 1918's representative of the Harvard Fund Council has resigned in protest over the appointment of J.

Library officials are considering abolishing the long-standing ban on Cliffies in the undergraduate library.In a letter sent yesterday to the deans and to Merle Fainsod, director of the University Library, the HUC listed three arguments against the presence of Cliffies in Lamont.First, the problem of space: Lamont seats only 1200 and is often overcrowded even without opening its doors to 1200 Cliffies. Daniel C. Goldfarb Jr. '66, chairman of the HUC, doubts that enough Harvard students would use the new Radcliffe Library to offset the overcrowding.The HUC also fears a book shortage, since the library was designed for the 1200 Harvard undergraduates. Goldfarb doubts that a significant number of Harvard students would use the now Radcliffe Library, which will be completed next September.—Compiled by Rebecca D. Robbins

Small ball is all the rage in the NBA. Instead of furnishing their frontcourts with tall, shot-blocking centers and forwards, many NBA teams have found success in employing smaller, faster lineups lacking true centers to stretch the floor, juice-up their fast-break offense, and wreck havoc with smaller, stingier defenders.For example, with the absence of a healthy center, the Golden State Warriors have employed three-guard, two-forward lineups regularly en route to posting a 22-10 record through early-January. Taking advantage of favorable matchups, focusing on gang-rebounding schemes, and playing stingy, pesky defense, the Warriors have beat teams with more traditional “true” 7-foot centers.And when you are talking about NBA small-ball, you can’t forget to mention the defending champion Miami Heat who consistently employ smaller, quicker lineups with LeBron James guarding the 4-position.While the <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2006-10-30-bonus-cover-small-ball_x.htm"">small-ball trend has very much become an integral part of many NBA team identities, it also has garnered much attention in the college basketball world as well. John Calipari at University of Kentucky is famous for his <a href=""http://coachingbetterbball.blogspot.com/2007/10/small-ball-revolution-memphis-attack.html"">dribble-drive offense schemes, plays that create spacing and penetration to take advantage of favorable matchups to allow for easy lay-ups and looks for open perimeter shots.Remember Shaka Smart and the bracket-busting VCU Rams on their last two NCAA Tournament runs? Well, Smart’s Rams charged deep into the Tournament by utilizing lineups with four perimeter players that forced a faster tempo of game, opened up perimeter looks, and pushed the ball in transition.
While small-ball isn’t always successful, it can work when teams are able to rebound, play tough defense, hit perimeter shots, and push the pace of the game.In its <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/29/harvard-mens-basketball-cal-recap/"">67-62 victory over the Cal Golden Bears, Harvard rolled with a lineup of four perimeter players and 6’ 6” sophomore Jonah Travis. While the game was relatively close, the Crimson shot significantly better from deep (10 for 27 while Cal was 0 for 6), turned the ball over less (8 turnovers as opposed to Cal’s 13), and passed the ball better (13 assists to Cal’s 9). At the same time, the Golden Bear big men didn’t rebound or shoot particularly well—even with two to four inches of height advantage—and couldn’t take advantage of a soft Harvard interior defense.With few traditional centers in the Ivy League, and its own lack of true center, the Crimson will likely look to transport its success from Haas Pavilion to Lavietes Pavilion against league opponents and continue to rely on hot shooting from wings like junior <a href=""http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/20751921"">Laurent Rivard (40.4 percent from 3), freshman Siyani Chambers (47.8 percent), sophomore Wesley Saunders (49.6 percent), and senior Christian Webster (38.8 percent). Expect to see more perimeter-shooting derived from dribble penetration and ball movement as the winning recipe for the 2012-2013 Tommy Amaker crew.—Staff Writer Joseph Pak can be reached at jpak@college.harvard.edu.

In its final non-conference matchup of the season, the Harvard women’s basketball team will travel to Kingston, R.I. on Sunday to take on the Rhode Island Rams.Rhode Island (5-9) enters the contest on a three-game losing streak, including a loss to a Providence squad that the Crimson defeated earlier this season. Harvard has bested the Rams in each of their last three meetings.“I think it’s going to be a good game for us,” senior forward Victoria Lippert said. “We’re continuing to get better and better. We’re practicing, learning, and growing, so I think this game is more about us, and I think that if we play well, we’re going to get the win.”The Crimson (8-5) enters the matchup coming off a decisive, 85-59 victory over Massachusetts on Wednesday. Harvard never fell behind in the game, amassed its highest scoring total of the year, and gave up its third-smallest point total of the season.The victory over the Minutewomen snapped a season-high three-game losing streak.
“We were definitely angry after those losses, so we were very motivated to come back and play well,” Lippert said. “I don’t think we played a perfect game against UMass, but I think we were able to execute better and play better defense at some points.”Junior guard Christine Clark scored her 1,000th career point in the win, a milestone that only 17 players in program history have reached. Clark finished with a team-high 19 points.Following a 20-point performance in a loss to Southern Methodist, Lippert tallied 17 points against the Minutewomen. Lippert, who has moved into tenth place on the program’s all-time scoring list, has totaled at least 15 points in five of her last seven games.Clark, Lippert, and sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle have served as the main cogs of the Crimson offense this season, as the trio has accounted for nearly 60 percent of the team’s scoring. Fagbenle was recently named the Ivy League Player and Rookie of the Week, and she captured both awards just two weeks ago as well.“[Those three girls] are a lot of fun to play with,” co-captain forward Miriam Rutzen said. “They work hard on both ends of the floor, they’re great scorers, and we love to feed them the ball so they can take it to the hole. As long as they keep doing that, and as long as we keep supporting them and backing them up with offensive rebounds, then we’ll have a great year.”Senior forward Emma Golen has also emerged as a legitimate three-point threat. Golen ranks first in the Ancient Eight, shooting 53.3 percent from behind the arc.A wealth of different options has helped Harvard post impressive offensive numbers all year.The Crimson leads the Ivy League in scoring, with 69.5 points per game, and has also posted a conference-best 45.2 field goal percentage.The Rams, on the other hand, have struggled to put points on the board. The team has scored more than 60 points only twice this year.“[This game] is going to be a great opportunity for us to show our defensive grit versus a team we know we can outperform,” Rutzen said. “We don’t want to give them one of their better nights. So if we can hold them below their scoring average, we know we will have proved something.”A young team, Rhode Island has six freshmen on its roster and only four players who have completed their sophomore years. The Rams are coming off a 94-53 loss to Northeastern, the team’s largest margin of defeat all season.Rhode Island has employed a balanced attack on offense so far this year, as its top three scorers all average within two points of each other. Freshman guard Tayra Melendez leads the team with 10.6 per game.Freshman forward Samantha Tabakman has also been an important presence for the Rams in the paint. Tabakman, who has come off the bench for much of the season, puts up 9.1 points per game and averages a team-best 7.9 rebounds.Sunday’s matchup will conclude the first half of the season for Harvard, and will provide the Crimson with a chance to pick up steam for its next fourteen contests against Ancient Eight foes.“Every game in the Ivy League counts, and there’s not an opportunity to redeem mistakes once you get into league play,” Rutzen said. “One game can make or break your chances at the NCAA Tournament. I think knowing that and having had an up-and-down non-conference season has prepared us really well for the intensity of the Friday and Saturday game-in, game-out competition to get us to our final goal of Ivy League champions.”

Fresh off of a one-point loss on the road to a heavily favored St. Mary’s squad, the Harvard men’s basketball team kicked off the New Year in dominant fashion against non-conference competitor Rice, claiming a 92-62 victory Saturday at Lavietes Pavilion.“We’re very pleased to have a chance to bounce back after an up-and-down road trip that we had out West,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought our kids really invested in the opportunity and played well here today.”With 13:15 to play in the first half, the Owls (3-10) crawled within three points of the Crimson (8-5), as Rice’s Austin Ramljak knocked down two free throws. But Harvard quickly responded and extended its lead, headed by an impressive shooting effort from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard.After a scoreless stretch of 3:27 and 10:52 left in the opening frame, Rivard knocked down his first of five three-pointers on the night, initiating a 15-2 Harvard run that put his team up, 28-12, with 7:25 left in the half.“[Rivard] is such a big weapon for us, and he always has been,” Amaker said. “I think he got into a good rhythm.”
From there the Crimson was able to maintain its stride, eventually blowing out the visiting Owls by a 30-point margin. Before Saturday’s contest, Harvard’s season high points total was just 79—a solid 13 points below its mark against Rice.“Intensity on the defensive end and keeping going for 40 minutes are some things we didn’t do at St. Mary’s,” Rivard said. “But today we did, and we kept our lead.”At the close of the first half—a period in which the Crimson hit 61.5 percent of its shots from the field—Harvard had amassed a 43-21 advantage.The Owls shot just 25 percent in the opening frame, with leading scorer Tamir Jackson—who averages 17.5 points—ending the period with just four points. Jackson finished the contest shooting 4 of 12 from the field for a total of 14 points.“That’s what we talked about…how much we were going to invest and commit to play well, and I think we did that very well defensively,” Amaker said. “The second half shooting percentage went up for them dramatically from the first half, but I thought overall our defense was outstanding.”After two consecutive scores from sophomore Jonah Travis to start the second frame, Rice never came closer than a 23-point deficit, and the Crimson was able to stretch its heavy advantage to 30 before the end of the game.“We need to find a rhythm here with our team,” Amaker said. “I think we were able to do that very nicely here this afternoon and gain a bit of confidence as we do things over stretches. It was important for us to feel like we played a very good 40 minutes of basketball today.”Rivard and sophomore wing Wesley Saunders paced all scorers on the night, contributing 21 points apiece, while sophomore Kenyatta Smith posted a career-high 11 points for the Crimson, shooting four of four from the field and three of five from the free-throw line.“Kenyatta Smith, in his minutes off the bench, was quality,” Amaker said. “He performed nicely for us, blocked shots, and scored on the interior.”After just five minutes of play, rookie point guard Siyani Chambers—who ended the contest with a double-double on 14 points and a career-high 10 assists—had already amassed three assists, as Harvard knocked down its first six shots of the game. But despite his prowess in most aspects of the game Saturday afternoon, Chambers had a game-high six turnovers.

Three goals by Princeton forward Andrew Calof led the Tigers over the Harvard men's hockey team, 3-2, on Friday night at Hobey Baker Rink. The loss was the third straight for the Crimson squad, which hasn't seen victory since beating then-No.10 Cornell on Nov. 16 at Lynah Rink, 4-1, on national television.Harvard (4-6-1, 3-4-0 ECAC) lacked offensive pressure through the contest, while Princeton (4-7-4, 3-3-3 ECAC) capitalized on the energy of its sold-out home crowd to outshoot the Crimson, 36 shots to 18. This was the first game this season in which the Tigers were able to win without scoring at least four goals.“I thought we battled really hard in the second and the third [periods],” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Through the first period, I don’t think we were at our best, but in the second and third, I thought we played well. We had some chances [and] had two breakaways there in the third.”Calof was the only member of his team to score during the game, finding the back of the net twice during regulation and once during overtime. 12 minutes and 20 seconds into the first period, the junior was assisted by sophomore defenseman Tom Kroshus and freshman forward Mike Ambrosia to blast the puck past Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard. Girard recorded 33 saves through the night, his third-highest number this season.Calof registered eight shots during his effort for the night. His second goal came almost nine minutes into the second period from just beyond the top of the right circle with help from forwards Kyle Rankin and Jack Berger to put Princeton up, 2-0.
“[Calof is] a good player,” senior forward Marshall Everson said. “He’s quick, he’s smart, he’s real crafty. The key with a guy like that is you have to keep a body on him, keep him outside.... He’s one of those guys you’ve got to watch out for.”Completing a hat trick, Calof’s third score was fatal for Harvard. Just under a minute into overtime, he came from behind the net to sneak the puck into the right corner of the net past Girard.“The third goal was a clever play,” Donato said. “[Calof] threw it out from behind the goal line off our skate and he’s a talented enough guy that he did that by design. When you play against a guy that’s creative and scores goals, you have to limit his chances and we didn’t do enough of that tonight.”The contest was Harvard’s second to continue past regulation this season. The Crimson has yet to win an overtime game this year.Harvard found its first goal with under five minutes to go in the third period. After a quick save by Girard against Tiger freshman forward Jonathan Liau, the Crimson first line was able to effectively penetrate Princeton’s offensive zone. Forwards Alex Fallstorm and Colin Blackwell raced down the ice to pass to Everson, who drilled the puck past Tigers goaltender Sean Bonar.Harvard was given just two opportunities for man advantage and was able to capitalize on one for a goal. During the second power play, 12 minutes and 50 seconds into the third period, two misses by Fallstorm allowed the senior, along with Everson, to assist Blackwell for Harvard’s second goal. Power plays have been problematic for the Crimson this season. Harvard has converted just four attempts out of 41 total this season, for a percentage of 9.8, the lowest in the ECAC.Conversely, the Crimson was only short-handed twice through the game. The first penalty came on high sticking by sophomore forward Petr Placek while the second was off of hooking by freshman forward Greg Gozzo. The penalty kill unit continued to be consistent, denying Princeton during both attempts. The Tigers have only converted two of their last 18 opportunities on the power play. Harvard is now at 82.9 percent in penalty killing.“Ultimately we’re trying to win hockey games,” Donato said. “We want to create more offensive chances. We have no excuses…. Our guys really fought back being down two-nothing. [They] came back and had a chance to get at least a point.”--Staff writer Cordelia Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu.

After allowing three goals in less than three-and-a-half minutes, Union looked to reset with a timeout. But the 30-second break in the action merely gave Harvard's top line a breather.Off the very next faceoff, Crimson co-captain Jillian Dempsey intercepted a Dutchwoman pass and tore across the blueline before slapping a shot past the left pad of Union goaltender Shenae Lundberg. The senior forward notched her second goal of the game to put the Harvard women's ice hockey team up six en route to a 9-0 rout of Union Friday night in Schenectady, N.Y.In its first game of the new year, the Crimson (10-1-1, 8-0-0 ECAC) enjoyed its largest margin of victory in a shutout since 2006. With the win, Harvard improved its all-time series record versus the Dutchwomen (5-10-3, 0-6-3 ECAC) to 19-0-0.""I think we came out strong, we finished strong and got better with each period,"" Crimson coach Katey Stone said. ""It was a complete game.""After jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the first, Harvard caught fire in the second frame, scoring five unanswered markers—four in the first six minutes of the period.
Sophomore defender Michelle Picard opened the second period onslaught with her first career goal. Picard threaded a wrister over the right shoulder of Lundberg from inside the circle.""[Picard] just works her tail off all the time,"" Dempsey said. ""It was really nice to see that pay off with a goal.""Picard and Dempsey finished the night with game-high +5 ratings. Less than a minute after Picard's marker, Dempsey scored from a similar location on the rink to extend her point streak to 26 games.Two and a half minutes later, a cross-rink lead pass from senior defender Kelsey Romatoski to Dempsey set up the Crimson's fifth goal of the game. The pass created a 2-on-1 in which Dempsey slid the puck to junior Lyndsey Fry, who buried it top-shelf.Fry's first goal of the game prompted Union's timeout, but it took only five seconds after the next faceoff for a Crimson player to find the back of the net--this time Dempsey with an assist credited to Fry.""[Dempsey] is relentless; she hunts pucks down,"" Stone said. ""She jumps into spaces; she has a great feel for what's going on. It was great to see her take some quick-release shots tonight.""Dempsey finished with a game-high five points. The Winthrop, Mass., native leads the NCAA in goals per game (1.33) and ranks second in points per game (2.5).For the final tally of the second period, Dempsey and Fry connected once more. Fry poke-checked the puck away from Union's Rebecca Babiak and ahead to Dempsey, who spun around to feed Fry in the crease. Fry deked around Union back-up goalie Madeleine Dahl for her ninth goal of the season.""The cool thing about [Dempsey] and I playing together is that it doesn't really matter who puts it away,"" said Fry, who ranks seventh in the nation with 1.73 points per game. ""We've been good about finding each other, and we are able to see each other and make plays all over the ice.""The Crimson bookended the second period with a pair of two-goal frames.

As the calendar closes in on the anniversary of Linsanity, Jeremy Lin ’10 had eight points and seven assists as the Houston Rockets dispatched the Milwaukee Bucks, 115-101 Friday. With Lin at the helm, the Rockets score the most points in the NBA, at 106.1 per game, and are sixth in the league in assists, at 23 per contest, led by Lin’s 6.4 a game. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the 11th game in which the Rockets have scored 115 or more points this season. No other team in the NBA has more than seven such games.
Lin left the game with 10:34 left in the third quarter after colliding with Bucks forward Larry Sanders in a scramble for a loose ball near midcourt. He sat out for only seven minutes before getting stitches and coming back into the game. Lin added four assists and four points in a pivotal fourth quarter, during which the Rockets scored 38 points and quickly turned a six-point advantage into a comfortable 14-point lead.
“I just know that when I came back, our guys were flying around with high energy,” Lin said in his postgame press conference. “We were getting stops, just the way we’re supposed to play, the way that we’ve played in the past in some spurts. And then we just tried to carry it over to the fourth quarter.”
Lin recorded four steals for the third time in four games and contributed seven or more assists for the fifth game in a row. After starting the season slow, Lin has come on to score in double figures in six of his last ten games and in that span has contributed six or fewer dimes only twice.
Over that same span, the Rockets have gone 8-2 with their only two losses coming to the Oklahoma City Thunder and the San Antonio Spurs—two top teams in the Western Conference. Along the way, the Rockets posted double-digit wins against the Chicago Bulls, Memphis Grizzlies, New York Knicks, and Philadelphia 76ers—all playoff teams from a year ago.

  Many Americans probably don’t know this, but the Philippines starts celebrating Christmas in September. That is when the carols start playing on the radio and shops begin putting up sales displays featuring stockings and snow (tropically-adapted snow, of course, since September brings 80 degree weather). The festivities build up to December 24, when the classic Filipino tradition is for large families to gather, exchange kisses and hugs, and eat. This get-together is called a “Noche Buena,” though “Food Fest” or “Guess Which Cousin is Which” would be more apt.
There are only three things that I can be certain will make an appearance at our family’s annual Christmas Eve gathering:1) Our cook’s revered lasagna, with the words “Merry X-Mas” written in ketchup above the topmost layer of cheese. 
2) My cousin’s dogs, aptly named Peewee and Poo (you can guess why).3) Bottles upon bottles of all kinds of wine.Everything else—including which relatives from our gigantic extended family actually show up—is always a gamble.
 
This year, my family thought releasing wish lanterns into the sky at midnight would add a little more spice to the event. My cousin had bought some paper lanterns for 50 pesos apiece (a little over a dollar), which could float away with the help of a “small” flame. Of course, small flames can eventually become big flames (standard science here), so I was a little worried about the fire hazard. See, my family doesn’t have a very good track record with fire, and the fact that the instructions were in Japanese didn’t help. But mother persisted, so I obliged.
 
The first lantern we sent off was pretty. I thought to myself that maybe we could pull this off without a hitch—maybe we could even release many at the same time!
 
The second lantern we sent off, however, was not as well-formed as the first one was. In fact, its top-left corner was sagging as it floated away, and just before it cleared our fence—our bamboo fence, I might add—the paper frame caught fire. In a blink, the entire lantern was ablaze. I heard several gasps. An officer on patrol started barking into his walkie-talkie, probably for a fire truck. My grandmother turned her face away so she didn’t have to watch what we all expected would happen next.
 
But, miraculously, the lantern dropped to the ground just inches from anything flammable, missing the bamboo fence, the tarp covering our dining area, and a bunch of bushes. No one moved as what was left of it floated to the ground. Everyone just watched the flames die out, mouths hanging open. It was a regular Christmas miracle.
My little brother laughed first, then my uncle laughed, and, finally, I laughed. Both humored and relieved, everyone turned to each other and started wishing one another a Merry Christmas. Uncles were drunk, I had gained a few pounds, and we were probably going to be fined by the village police for setting fire hazards into the sky, but it was Christmas with my crazy family and the “noche” couldn’t be anymore “buena.”

While your fall semester classes are now a distant memory, here’s an unfortunate newsflash to sap the last bit of holiday spirit from your break: Grades are up.  Instead of regretting your multiple choice answers on that make-or-break final, or waiting anxiously to see if your last class’ results are in, take a break from your Student Record to see if some of your favorite fall sports made the grade this semester.
<a name=""jump"">Football: B+/A-
 The Crimson got off to a hot start, winning its first five games of the season by an average of 27 points. But then came the midterm exam at Princeton, where Harvard saw its nation-best 14-game win streak come to an end with a 39-34 loss to the Tigers. The Crimson bounced back with a win at Dartmouth though, and then followed that up by routing Columbia, 69-0.  But Harvard failed to deliver when it mattered the most, losing 30-21 at Penn in the de-facto Ivy League championship game. It wasn't last year’s Ivy League championship season, but even with some hiccups on the road, the Crimson turned in a season full of solid performances and ended its term with a climactic fourth quarter finish to beat out rival Yale in the final test of the semester.  It was valiant effort, even without the Ivy Champ rings to show for it.
&nbsp;
Men’s Soccer: C
To say the men’s soccer team had a disappointing season would be a bit of an understatement.  The Crimson went a dismal 3-11-3 on the season and failed to pick up a win against a conference foe, going 0-6-1 in Ivy League play.  If anything though, it was a season of near misses.  The Crimson fell just one goal short in seven of its losses, and the team went into overtime six times, only to come out with three ties and three losses.  Here’s to hoping the men’s team makes the grade by the time next season rolls around.
&nbsp;
Cross Country: A
An appearance at the NCAA Championships for the first time in nearly three decades capped what the director of Harvard Cross Country/Track called a “historic season” for the women’s team.  On the men’s side, the Crimson finished sixth in the Northeast regional, its best finish since 2006, and also sent two runners to NCAAs.
&nbsp;
Women’s Volleyball: B
The Crimson got off to a sluggish start, losing its first three matchups, then had a five-game losing streak to finish its non-conference slate with a 2-8 record.  But Harvard picked up some steam in the second half of the semester, going 7-7 against Ivy opponents to finish fourth in the league and only two wins away from a second-place finish.  It was a bumpy start, but we all know the second half of the semester counts more than the first, and some fine finishes down the stretch helped salvage what could’ve been a down season.
&nbsp;
Field Hockey: C+
The Crimson went 3-13 this year, and 1-6 against Ivy opponents.  It was a tough first year for head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden, as Harvard saw its season end with an eight-game losing streak.  The Crimson finished tied with Brown at the bottom of the Ivy League standings, a sizeable drop from last year’s fifth-place finish and 8-9 overall record.
&nbsp;
Men’s Water Polo: B
It was a year of fresh faces and fresh talent for the men’s water polo team.  With the bulk of its roster comprised of freshmen and sophomores, the young team got off to sluggish start, going 3-5 in the opening weeks.  But the Crimson hit its stride in the middle of the season, riding a nine-game win streak.  Harvard finished off the year with a 15-19 record after some tough losses to top-ranked teams on a California road trip and some close losses to Northeast opponents late in the season.  Look for Harvard to come in strong next year, when the underclassmen have a full season of collegiate play under their belts (or speedos, so to speak).

While you may still be in holiday mode, Harvard athletes are in the midst of a busy January filled with plenty of activity. Read on for a preview of five upcoming games that are sure to be exciting and crucial to rest of the season.
<a name=""jump"">5. Men’s Squash at Princeton
On January 13, the Harvard men’s squash team (6-0, 1-0 Ivy) will visit Princeton hoping to defeat the defending national champions. The Tigers dismantled Trinity College at last year’s CSA national tournament to break the Bantams 13-year long hold on the title. Princeton was also victorious against the Crimson last season, halting a 10-game win streak last January as the Tigers won, 5-4. One can expect an exciting match at the No. 1 position between Harvard junior Ali Farag and Princeton senior Todd Harrity. Farag captured the CSA individual title in 2012 while Harrity won it in 2011, becoming the first American in over 21 years to do so. This year, both teams enter the contest undefeated; only one squad can leave retaining a perfect record in this critical conference matchup.
4. Women’s Squash at Princeton
Last season, a showdown with Princeton saw the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team edge the Tigers, 5-4. The contest was one of just two 5-4 matches for the Crimson all season. On the verge of losing an undefeated record, then-freshman Haley Mendez was down, 2-0, in the No. 4 position but came from behind, taking the final three games to win the tie-breaking match. This year, Harvard (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) will arrive at Princeton Jan. 13 hoping to prevail once again over a talented Tigers squad led by co-captain Julie Cerullo, who is undefeated at the No. 1 position this season. Cerullo lost, 3-0, at No. 1 to then-freshman Amanda Sobhy last year and fell to her again in the national individual semifinals as Sohby ultimately took the top prize. During a November scrimmage, the Crimson yet again squeezed out a win over Princeton, 5-4. Can they do it again next week?
3. Women’s Basketball vs. Dartmouth
After going through an up-and-down slate of challenging non-conference opponents, the Harvard women’s basketball team will finally open Ivy League play at home against Dartmouth Jan. 12. The Crimson (9-5) is coming off two strong wins against Massachusetts and Rhode Island and a difficult tournament in San Diego, where it fell to Oklahoma State and SMU. Last year, Harvard downed the Big Green in both matchups. The first game saw then-sophomore Christine Clark notch her second career double-double with 17 points, including a perfect 7-for-7 at the charity stripe, and 10 rebounds as the Crimson won, 71-63. During the second meeting, Emma Golen notched a career-high 21 points as the team closed out the regular season with a victory, 74-69. Harvard would go on to win its first game in the WNIT in program history. This year’s squad has seen strong performances by Clark, the leading scorer with 16.6 points per game, and Golen, who stands atop the Ivy League in three-point percentage.
2. Men’s Hockey at Yale
Earlier this season, the Bulldogs came to Cambridge and dealt the Harvard men’s hockey team its first loss of the season, 5-1. Last season, the Crimson met Yale during the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament, dropping the first game but taking the next two to make it to the tourney finals. The Crimson (4-7-1, 3-5 ECAC), which hasn’t won a game since beating Cornell Nov. 16, will travel to New Haven Jan. 18 hoping to get back on track. The squad has been plagued by a lack of offensive pressure, converting on just five of its 49 power play attempts this season. On the other side, the Yale team (7-4-3, 3-3-1 ECAC) registers over 35 shots per game, six more than Harvard does. The game, which will be broadcast on NBC Sports Network, will be another important ECAC matchup. After recent conference losses to Princeton and Quinnipiac, the Crimson will look to regain momentum at the midway point of the season.
1. Men’s Basketball at Dartmouth
With 2011-2012 as a banner season in the history of Harvard basketball, all eyes are on this new Crimson team as it opens it Ivy League season in Hanover Jan. 12. The squad, which went 8-5 in non-conference play, has already topped major D1 teams California and Boston College thanks to major improvements by sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, who went from an average of 3.3 points per game last season to leading the Ivy League with 16.2 points per game this season, and the efforts of rookie point guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers, who was named to the Bob Cousy Award watch list, ranks first in the Ivy League in assists and recorded his first career double-double Jan. 5 against Rice. The Crimson, which beat Dartmouth in both contests last season, will meet a Big Green team that has lost its last seven games and whose top two scorers both average under 11 points per game. Harvard will need to contain 6’9” sophomore forward Gabas Maldunas, who put up 15 points on the Crimson during their first meeting in 2012, as it seeks its first conference win.

While the Crimson’s football season came to a close in November with a victory over Yale, senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk will suit up once again in a couple weeks, having accepted an invitation to play in the 2013 Senior Bowl. The event, which pits the nation’s top senior prospects against each other in a pre-draft showdown, will be held Jan. 26 at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama.
Juszczyk declined prior invitations to play in both the CDS All-Star Game and the East-West Shrine Game, both of which are also held in January.
Juszczyk was a key piece of the Crimson’s offense for all four of his years at Harvard. As a freshman, he appeared in all of the Crimson’s contests, recording 11 catches for 124 yards. Juszczyk was named honorable mention All-Ivy League the following year.
But his last two seasons for Harvard were particularly impressive. As a junior, Juszczyk recorded a league-best 37 receptions for 512 yards and was the recipient of the College Football Performance Award as the FCS’s best tight end. The two-time All-American finished his senior season with a team-high 52 receptions for 706 yards, including a season-best 15 catches and 192 yards in the Crimson’s contest against Princeton. Juszczyk averaged a team-best 70.6 yards per game and led the Harvard offense with eight touchdown receptions.
The Senior Bowl, which pits North against South, gives NFL coaches and executives the opportunity to watch the nation’s top prospects in action. Annually, 800 NFL coaches and general managers scout the practices and game, with entire NFL coaching staffs at the helm on both sides of the field. This year, head coach Dennis Allen and his Oakland Raiders staff will coach the North squad, while Detroit Lions head coach Jim Schwartz and his assistants will lead the South.
The Senior Bowl will be televised by NFL Network. Kickoff is set for 4:00pm EST.

After failing to break double digits in scoring on Friday against the Milwaukee Bucks, Jeremy Lin ’10 put up 20 points during Saturday night’s contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers (8-27).
On the way to a road victory, 112-104, the Houston Rockets guard also contributed four rebounds and five assists. In the win, the Rockets (20-14) retained their position as first among all teams in points per game, with 106.2, and extended their winning streak to four games.
<a name=""jump"">Lin had a standout second quarter that saw him score 14 of his 20 points and drill all three of his attempts from behind the arc. Lin finished the game shooting 60 percent on treys, much better than the 26 percent he was shooting coming in. His performance helped the Rockets, who trailed 26-20 at the close of the first frame, regain the lead heading into the locker room.
“Sometimes all it takes is one and for me I’m glad I was able to get some to drop tonight,” Lin said in a postgame interview. “It felt good.”
A big fourth quarter from Houston’s James Harden, who had a team-high 29 points on the night and 16 in the final stanza, helped the Rockets to seal the win. Harden and Lin had to contend with the Cavaliers’ main scoring threat of Kyrie Irving, who finished with a game-high 30 points. Irving had eight turnovers, many of which were caused by defensive pressure from Harden and Lin.
“He’s a heckuva player,” Lin said of the Cleveland point guard. “I tried to make it difficult for him, but he’s one heckuva player and he’s tough to stop.”
With the win, Houston is now 14-2 versus the Eastern Conference. The Rockets remain in sixth place in the West, two games behind the Memphis Grizzlies.

The coast may have been different, but the result was the same for Laurent Rivard.After shooting a combined 8 of 16 from deep during the Harvard men’s basketball team’s visit to California last week, the junior co-captain continued to make it rain from beyond the arc at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday. Rivard went five of seven from three-point range, helping the Harvard men’s basketball team past Rice with a season-high 21 points.After the Owls pulled within three, 13-10, less than seven minutes into the contest, Rivard played an instrumental role in the Crimson’s run. The junior put a stop to the Crimson’s 4:36 scoring drought, knocking down his first triple of the night with 10:52 to go. It wasn’t long before he added No. 2 and No. 3, as Rivard drilled back-to-back three-pointers less than three minutes later to extend Harvard’s lead to 14 with 8:30 to play.In the first half alone Rivard recorded 15 points—more than he totaled in all but four games so far this season.Before it was all said and done, the junior added one more triple to give him five on the day—matching a season high.
“We need him to shoot,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He has a green light, and he’s the only one on our team who has that.”The Crimson’s leading returning scorer entering the 2012-13 season, Rivard struggled at times early this season. Through Harvard’s first 10 contests, Rivard was shooting 39.3 percent from deep—down from his clip of 41.0 percent a season ago—and averaging 2.4 made three-pointers per contest.But in the Crimson’s past three contests, Rivard has shot a combined 13 of 23 (56.5 percent) from three-point range and is averaging 16.3 points per game.The difference?“Just focus,” Rivard said. “I work on it everyday in practice. It’s got to fall some day, you know?”Rivard has also been putting up more attempts from beyond the arc in recent contests: In his four most recent matchups, Rivard is averaging 7.75 three-point attempts compared to 5.88 through the Crimson’s first nine games.But according to Rivard, he has not made a conscious effort to increase his shot total.“I haven’t tried harder; I’ve just been running the offense,” Rivard said. “Guys are doing a great job of finding me.”FRESH FACESTwo Harvard players dressed for their first game in a Crimson uniform on Saturday.

Going into this week, the Harvard women's basketball team needed a spark. The Crimson was looking to bounce back from its first three-game losing streak of the season as Ivy League play loomed on the horizon.With a familiar shooting ace at the helm, Harvard (9-5) found its way back into the win column as it closed out its nonconference slate. Junior Christine Clark led all scorers in Crimson wins over UMass, 85-59, and Rhode Island, 63-56, as she became the 18th women's basketball player in Harvard history to reach 1,000 career points. On Monday, the junior guard received her fifth career Ivy League Player of the Week nod.Clark arrived at the milestone in an anticlimactic yet fitting fashion Wednesday night at Lavietes Pavillion, sinking two free throws early in the second half to put the Crimson up 21 on UMass. The Tucson, Ariz. native has reached the charity stripe more often than any other Harvard player this season and ranks fifth in the Crimson record book for career free throws made.""I don't think that she had any idea [as a recruit] that she was going to score a thousand points, but we're not one bit surprised because she can score in so many different ways,"" Crimson coach Delaney-Smith said."" We can post her up, she's a great offensive rebounder, she can shoot the three, and she can go to the basket, so she's really multi-dimensional in her attack. She's an impact player. ""Clark is the fastest Crimson player to reach 1,000 points since Reka Cserny in 2004 and joins senior Victoria Lippert as the only active players on the squad to have passed the milestone. Lippert reached a new milestone of her own Wednesday, scoring 17 points to crack the top ten of Harvard's all-time career scoring list.
""I'm just so honored to be a part of that group,"" Clark said. ""It just makes me feel good about all the hard work that I've put in over the years.""Delaney-Smith can vouch for Clark's hard work.""There isn't a better competitor in the world…. She'll go through a wall to have you win,"" Delaney-Smith said of the player known as ""Clarky"" to teammates and coaches. ""She puts in a lot of extra time to do film work and to keep getting better.""Clark started every game her freshman season after choosing Harvard over traditional top programs DuPaul, Kansas State and Arizona State. Delaney-Smith has seen Clark improve on the court throughout her years in Cambridge.""She's getting better at shooting the three,"" Delaney-Smith said. ""She has a nice midrange game. When she was younger, she would go all the way in. Now, she's developed a beautiful, midrange, very athletic pull-up.""At Rhode Island, Clark recorded a game-high 21 points and shot 8-of-14 from the field. She scored nine of Harvard's last 16 points to help the Crimson put the brakes on a comeback bid from the Rams late in the second half.""I think it was a great win to pull out [Sunday],"" said Clark, who leads all Harvard scorers this season with 16.6 points per game. ""I don't think we really played our best game, but I think it does show a lot that we were able to pull out the win even with a lot of areas to improve in. We have so much potential, and I'm really excited for conference play.""The achievement of team-based milestones is now at the top of Clark's to-do list.""I want to win an Ivy League championship more than anything,"" Clark said, ""and I would want to win some games in the NCAA tournament.""Meanwhile, Delaney-Smith hopes that Clark can perfect her passing game and cut down on turnovers. Clark's role as one of the Crimson's primary ball handlers has tested her playmaking abilities.With Clark's work ethic, though, encouraging her to put in the hours shouldn't be much of a problem.""Any coach,"" Delaney-Smith said, ""would love to coach a kid like Clarky.""--Staff writer Michael D.

Harvard’s football season may be long over, but the awards keep coming for quarterback Colton Chapple. The senior was named the recipient of the 2012 CFPA Quarterback Award, an honor given annually to the nation’s top FCS quarterback.
<a name=""jump"">Chapple has racked up the accolades this offseason after his record-breaking senior year. Earlier this month, Chapple was named the recipient of the 74th George “Bulger” Lowe Award, presented by the Gridiron Club of Greater Boston as New England’s “Heisman Trophy.” In December, the senior was presented with the Asa S. Bushnell Cup as the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. Chapple also nabbed the Division I FCS Gold Helmet after being named the New England Player of the Year by the New England Football Writers’ Association.
Chapple finished the year with the country's second best passer rating. The senior registered a school-record 24 touchdown passes for the year. He completed 194 passes on 294 attempts, good for a career best .660 completion percentage.
In the Crimson’s loss to Princeton this season, Chapple set a school single-game record with 448 yards on 31-of-45 passing.  His five touchdowns against the Tigers tied a career best.
Chapple has firmly cemented himself in the Harvard record books alongside the best Crimson quarterbacks of all time. Chapple is tied for second all-time with 39 career passing touchdowns alongside current Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.  His .622 career completion percentage stands as the second best mark in Harvard history.

Christine Clark’s passing 1000-point milestone and impressive play won the junior guard on the women’s basketball team the first Athlete of the Week honors of the new year, but several other athletes rang in 2013 with their own stellar performances, earning them recognition by The Back Page.
 
Jonah Travis, Men’s Basketball
 
Two days after notching nine points to help his team pull off an upset against Cal, the sophomore forward doubled his scoring average on the season against St. Mary’s, netting 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting to tie his career high. Although Harvard would drop the game, 70-69, after holding the upper hand for all but the final second, Travis’s performance helped the Crimson extend its lead to as large as 18 in the first half. The Minnesota native also tallied 10 points and four rebounds in Harvard’s rout of Rice, 92-62.
<a name=""jump"">
Siyani Chambers, Men’s Basketball
 
The freshman ball-handler recorded 19 points in the heartbreaker against the Gaels, including a perfect 5-5 from behind the arc. Chambers outscored St. Mary’s point guard Matthew Dellavedova, a member of the 2012 Australian Olympic team, by 15 points as the Crimson defense effectively shut him down for much of the evening. The rookie guard also posted a double-double against the Owls, tallying 14 points and 10 dimes on the night.
Victoria Lippert, Women’s Basketball
 
A clutch trey from Lippert put Harvard ahead of Rhode Island, 52-49, near the end of a hotly contested game. Crucial free throws by the senior guard and teammate Clark sealed the win for the Crimson, 63-56. With her 11-point performance, the San Diego native surpassed Emily Tay in the record books to move into 10th place for career points with 1,274 points. The veteran also helped her team blow past UMass, 85-59, on the second day of the new year, netting 17 points and tying her career-high of five assists.
Jillian Dempsey, Women’s Hockey
 
The senior co-captain led her team to an unblemished start to 2013 with victories over Union and Rensselaer, both on unfriendly ice. The trip to New York began with Dempsey matching her career-high of five points against the Dutchwomen, scoring twice and tallying three assists as Harvard bested Union, 9-0, marking its biggest margin of victory of the season. The forward added another assist against the Engineers, allowing junior forward Kalley Armstrong to one-time the puck past the RPI goaltender in a 2-1 victory.
Kelley Romatoski, Women’s Hockey
 
With the game against the Engineers tied at one apiece in the third period, the RPI goalie blocked a shot attempt, but before she could corral the puck to survive the Engineers’ penalty kill, sophomore forward Samantha Reber sent it up the ice to Romatoski. The senior slapped it past the goaltender into the back left of the net, giving the Crimson a 2-1 lead that it would not relinquish. The game-winner was the Romatoski’s fifth goal of the season. The defender also netted a goal and an assist against Union the previous night.

After his team blew an 18-point lead to St. Mary’s less than a week ago, men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker probably wasn’t counting his chickens, even heading into halftime with a 43-21 lead over Rice at Lavietes on Saturday night.
But when the final buzzer sounded and the scoreboard showed a 92-62 advantage for the home team, the Virginia native notched something that had just slipped from his grasp on New Year’s eve: his 100th career win as a Harvard coach, a record reached only by three other Crimson leaders.
<a name=""jump"">Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard and sophomore guard Wesley Saunders both tallied 21 points on the night to help lift the Crimson to victory, while freshman point guard Siyani Chambers turned in a double-double performance to contribute as well.
The milestone isn’t the only one that the former Michigan coach has accomplished in Cambridge since his start in 2007, however. In just Amaker’s second season coaching in the Ivy League, the Crimson, led by then-junior guard Jeremy Lin’s 27-point performance, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/1/7/mens-basketball-stuns-no-17-boston/"">upset No. 17 Boston College, a team that had just recently upset No. 1 UNC. The win was the first in Harvard’s history over a ranked opponent.
A year later, Amaker led the squad to a school record 21 wins, a record which he surpassed in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons with 23 and 26 victories, respectively.
Last season, a key win by Princeton over Penn helped <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/7/mbk-tournament-030612/"">the Crimson earn the automatic Ivy League berth to March Madness, its first trip to the NCAA tournament since 1946, marking a near-complete turnaround during his tenure. From an 8-22 record in his first season to a 26-4 record in the 2011-12 season, the former Duke star turned a league bottom-feeder into an Ancient Eight champion.
Harvard travels to Hanover next week to begin Ivy play against Dartmouth as Amaker inches closer to all-time record of 178 wins, held by Frank Sullivan.

The Harvard men’s hockey team’s midseason slide hit another low point Saturday night, as the Crimson dropped a 6-2 decision at No. 5/9 Quinnipiac that leaves it winless in its last six games.The Bobcats (16-3-2, 10-0-0 ECAC) scored two goals in the first ten minutes and never looked back, as Harvard (4-7-1, 3-5-0) junior goaltender Raphael Girard allowed five goals for the third time in four contests.“It was a tough game,” senior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “[But] I don’t really think the result reflects the game itself. I think it was a lot closer.”Playing without leading scorer Jimmy Vesey—who was in Ufa, Russia helping the United States win gold at the IIHF World Junior Championships—the Crimson struggled to get anything going offensively, especially on the power-play, as it managed just one goal on its eight man-up opportunities against the ECAC’s best penalty kill.At the other end, Girard made just 12 saves in 17 attempts before being pulled midway through the second period in favor of freshman Peter Traber, who for the second time in three games was forced to fill in for the junior who last year was dominant down the stretch in sparking the Crimson’s run to the ECAC Championship Game.
It was in a February contest against the Bobcats last season that Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 called on Girard to replace a struggling Steve Michalek in net.Girard saved all 26 shots fired at him that night to energize a Harvard comeback win. From there the junior was on his way to the ECAC Goaltender of the Month award and owned the nation’s fourth-best save percentage by the end of the year.Eleven months later, it was another game against Quinnipiac that could force a struggling Girard back into a platoon.“I’d put the loss more on me than on my teammates,” the goalie said. “I need to step up my game.”The Bobcats got on the board early and often Saturday night in front of a sellout crowd at the TD Bank Sports Center to extend their unbeaten streak to 14 games.Bryce Van Brabant scored just 1:51 into the match with a shot over Girard’s shoulder from the left faceoff circle, and minutes later Travis St. Denis put home a one-timer off a two-on-one to extend Quinnipiac’s lead to 2-0.Senior forward Luke Greiner cut the Bobcats’ lead in half later in the period. Classmate Marshall Everson emerged from a four-player scrum behind the net and pushed the puck to Greiner, who fired a one-timer past Eric Hartzell for the score.But coming out of the first intermission, the Bobcats tallied three goals in the period’s first nine minutes to extend their lead to 5-1 and send Girard to the bench.Matthew Peca scored first, putting a rebound away over the goalie’s shoulder on a power-play following a tripping-the-goalie penalty on freshman Brayden Jaw.Just over two minutes later, Fallstrom scored a backhanded goal but was called for interference, negating the score and giving Quinnipiac another man-up chance. The Bobcats took full advantage when Loren Barron beat Girard to make it 4-1.

After cruising through the first half without ever giving up its lead, the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself battling for its second consecutive win in a contentious second period.Tied at 49 with four minutes to play, a three pointer by senior forward Victoria Lippert sparked a 14-7 run to close out the game and hand Harvard (9-5) its last non-conference win over Rhode Island (5-10), 63-56.“We were kind of taken aback that it became such a close game,” said co-captain and forward Emma Golen, who knocked down back-to-back treys in the opening minutes of the game. “At the end we finally dug in and realized the power was in our hands.”The Crimson held a five-point lead coming into the second period, but the Rams came out firing, tying up the game in just over a minute. Over the next 15 minutes, Harvard fought to stay in the game, tying up the score three more times before taking the lead at the sixteen-minute mark.“We just didn’t flow as well offensively,” Golen said of the second half. “There was no connection on the floor and our energy was lacking. We just weren’t playing team Harvard basketball, which was a little disappointing.”
Junior guard Christine Clark led the way down the stretch, adding seven of her game-high 21 points in the final four minutes. Clark shot 8-14 from the field, and tallied four points from the charity stripe. Back-to-back free throws by Lippert with four seconds on the clock iced the hard-won victory for the Crimson.“I thought we were a better team, and we wanted to keep the game at a higher level,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we had just inexplicable defensive errors, and it wasn’t just one person. It was a snowball effect of not being on the same page as a team.""The Crimson opened the matchup in a dominant fashion, jumping out to a ten-point lead five minutes in and holding the Rams to just one score, a jump shot by leading scorer Brianna Thomas. The freshman guard tallied 15 points and was spelled by sophomore guard Megan Strauman, who added 10 points.With Harvard up by eight points in the final minutes of the half, Rhode Island crawled within five, driving to the basket and making three consecutive layups without a Harvard score after the Crimson committed turnovers on the two punctuating possessions. Turnovers continue to plague the Crimson down the stretch, handing the Rams 17 points to Harvard’s nine.Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle—who added nine points for the Crimson—helped spell the defensive lapses with strong post play. Fagbenle led the team for the fifth straight game with 10 rebounds—including nine on defense—against a physical Rams squad.“Unfortunately [Fagbenle] didn’t get the calls going her way,” Delaney-Smith said. “For a young kid that’s a frustrating situation, and that’s not going to be unusual for her. Regardless of how the calls go she just has to understand how valuable she is to this game.”Senior Elle Hagedorn was crucial to the defensive effort off the bench, adding four rebounds and three steals. The guard—who averages 2.3 points per game in 17 minutes of play—led the team with a season-high four assists and matched her season-high eight points, shooting 2-2 and knocking down four free throws in 29 minutes of play.“[Hagedorn is] a defensive stopper and a sparkplug off the bench,” Delaney-Smith said. “She can beat anybody off the drive, and she took it to the hole really well tonight. I think she defaults to some of our statistical leaders when there are times that we would like her to be a scorer as well.""Five of Hagedorn’s eight points came late in the second half. Down by four with eight minutes to play, she hit a layup to bring Harvard within two. After Clark hit two free throws, Hagedorn drove to the basket a second time, drawing the foul and completing the three-point play from the stripe to put the Crimson on top.In its victory, Harvard outshot the Rams across the board, capitalizing on its three-point prowess to make up for its 68.2 free throw percentage, which dipped below its 75.5 season mark. The Crimson made more than half of its shots from the perimeter for the fifth time this season, and its 41.7 season record is good for third in the NCAA.Harvard’s win moved the team to 9-5 on the season entering Ivy League play and marked the Rams’ fourth consecutive loss.--Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu

With just under eight minutes to go in the final frame and the Harvard women’s hockey team holding on to a 2-1 lead, junior forward Lyndsey Fry was called for hooking, providing Rensselaer with a crucial power play opportunity to even the score.18 seconds later, teammate and fellow junior forward Gina McDonald joined Fry in the penalty box on a cross-checking call, giving the Engineers nearly a full two minutes of having a 5-on-3 advantage on the ice.But freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who completed a third-period shutout, thwarted any RPI attempts at a late comeback, making two critical saves, and the Engineers couldn’t convert on the special teams opportunity, despite taking five shots during their power play.“Honestly, it’s not something that happens to us very often, to be on a 5-on-3, but we practice our penalty kill a lot, and we’re prepared for any situation,” Fry said. “ I think we’ve only had one goal against us on penalty kill, and it brings confidence to our game. We trust each other, we trust our goalies, and we do the little things to make sure that nobody gets by us.”The Crimson (11-1-1, 9-0-0 ECAC) held on for the remaining five minutes on Saturday afternoon at Houston Field House to eke out a 2-1 victory over RPI (6-12-2, 4-6-0 ECAC), keeping its league record unblemished. With the win, No. 4 Harvard broke a four-game Engineers winning streak and catapulted over Quinnipiac into the top spot in the ECAC with 18 points.
“RPI is definitely a tough team; they always give us a tough game,” sophomore defender Michelle Picard said. “They’re physical and strong and they battle hard, so they’re a fun team to play against, and we always know that it’s going to be a tough one. It was a great win for us, especially coming back to start off 2013 with two wins.”The final period was rife with special teams opportunities, as both teams were penalized three times. The Engineers came up empty-handed on all three of its power plays, all of which came in the third frame.The Crimson only converted on one of its four power play opportunities, but that was enough to take home the victory. With RPI’s junior defender Madison Marzario on a penalty for checking early in the third period, Harvard quickly took advantage of the situation to break a 1-1 tie.Senior defender Kelsey Romatoski sent the puck down the ice to sophomore forward Hilary Crowe, who found her shot blocked by sophomore goaltender Kelly O’Brien. But sophomore forward Samantha Reber was there to collect the rebound, and she passed it to Romatoski, who slid it past O’Brien to give the Crimson the lead for the remaining 14 minutes.After lighting up the arena with nine goals against Union the night before, Harvard was held scoreless in the first period, where goaltenders on both sides achieved shutouts. But when the second frame began, the Crimson came out firing.“It’s kind of tough coming off of a huge win like that, where the goals are just coming one after the other, to come and play a team that’s going to be a lot better in their defensive end,” Fry said. “ [Harvard coach Katey Stone] normally doesn’t have to say much because we’re pretty good at figuring out what we have to do as players, but we regrouped [after the first period] and realized that every game is different, and the way we won last night was a lot different from the way we had to win today,”Less than three minutes into the second, senior forward Jillian Dempsey intercepted the puck from sophomore defender Kathryn Schilter behind the Engineers net and sent it to a wide-open junior forward Kalley Armstrong. Armstrong, who was waiting in the slot, slapped the puck past O’Brien’s pads to put Harvard on the scoreboard first.The Crimson outshot RPI 26-20, taking half of its shots in the third period. Maschmeyer recorded 19 saves on the day, while her RPI counterpart notched 24 to hold Harvard, ranked sixth in the nation on scoring offense with 3.59 goals per game, to just two.Engineers freshman forward Mari Mankey notched RPI’s only goal, which came near the end of the second period. Mankey appeared to be passing from the left of the crease, but instead of finding a teammate, the puck ricocheted off of Maschmeyer’s leg into the back of the net, knotting the score at one apiece.With 1:08 left before the final buzzer, the Engineers pulled O’Brien from the game, opting to go for six attackers on the ice, but the offensive advantage failed to force an overtime period.--Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samantalin@college.harvard.edu

The Harvard wrestling team opened its dual-meet season Saturday morning at the Malkin Athletic Center with a win over Rider, 24-17. The Crimson (1-0, 0-0 EIWA) took five of ten matches from the Broncs (4-2, 0-0 CAA) to secure the victory.Freshman 125-pounder Jeffrey Ott pulled Harvard ahead just over a minute into the eighth match of the meet with a fall over Rider freshman Patrick Skinner. The win came on the heels of a 2-1 overtime victory by sophomore heavyweight David Ng.""That was just a gutsy match,"" said Crimson coach Jay Weiss of the performance from Ng, who prevented an escape in the second overtime period to hang on for the win.In the next match, Ott opened strong to swing the meet in Harvard's favor.""[Ott] is just a goer. He can just put guys on their backs at will,"" Weiss said. ""He went out there and took charge right away.""
The rookie from Chelmsford, Mass. was energized by Ng's win and home state support.""I knew if I won with Steven [Keith] and Ryan [Osleeb] coming behind me that we'd be in good shape,"" Ott said. ""I had a bunch of people from Massachusetts coming out to support me, so it was great in my first home match to get the pin and basically put the match away.""The Broncs struck first as Rider freshman Curt Delia recorded a technical fall over Crimson sophomore Alexis Wagener in the 149-lb. division. But No. 9 co-captain Walter Peppelman responded for Harvard in the next match with a lightning-quick pin ten seconds into the 157-lb. grapple to record the fall over Broncs junior Patrick Sabatini and push the Crimson ahead, 6-5.""That is pretty remarkable,"" Weiss said of Peppelman's ten-second pin. ""That doesn't happen often in college. [Peppelman] likes to do that kind of stuff, so that was a lot of fun.""While Harvard keeps no official records about match length, Peppelman's match ranks among the quickest in Crimson history. Peppelman claims to have recorded a six-second pin earlier in his collegiate career.After the fourth match, Harvard remained one point up on Rider. Broncs junior Ramon Santiago won a 7-4 decision over Crimson freshman Devon Gobbo in the 165-lb. division, but junior 174-pounder Cameron Croy put Harvard back on top, 9-8, with a 6-3 decision over junior James Brundage.Rider won back-to-back decisions in the fifth and sixth matches to surge ahead, 14-9, as sophomore 184-pounder Clint Morrison defeated Crimson sophomore Josh Popple, 9-2, and unranked sophomore Donald McNeil surprised No. 20 James Fox, 8-2, in the 197-lb. division.""Fox has still got some rust on because he hasn't competed all first semester. He didn't wrestle his best, but I know that was kind of his first time back,"" Weiss said. ""I think he's going to just keep getting better and better.""Ng and Ott's back-to-back victories in the next two matches sealed the final lead change of the meet to give Harvard an 18-14 advantage with two matches left. Rider 133-pounder Jimmy Morris won a narrow 5-4 decision over Crimson sophomore Ryan Osleeb in the penultimate match to push the Broncs within a point of the lead, but a shorthanded Rider squad opted to forfeit the final match of the meet in the 141-lb. division to No. 10 Steven Keith.For the first time, Harvard Athletics will offer live and on-demand online-streaming of wrestling for all five Crimson home meets this season. Saturday's installment featured color commentary from two-time wrestling All-American Dennis DeNuzio '98.""It's really exciting. Our video department is doing an outstanding job,"" Weiss said. ""I got emails from fans today saying it was really cool to watch us. We're just trying to get to the next level, to get people aware of what we're doing as a team.""--Staff writer Michael D.

Riding a four game losing streak, the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-7-1, 3-5 ECAC) will be happy to have one of its key offensive contributors back in the lineup.
Freshman Jimmy Vesey was missing in action the past few weeks for the Crimson. The forward was busy helping USA’s U20 national team win gold in the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. On Saturday, the U.S. topped defending champion Sweden, 3-1, in the gold medal match. The victory was the first for an American squad since 2010 and a marked improvement over last year’s seventh place finish.
<a name=""jump"">Vesey saw action in all seven games for the U.S., registering four assists for the tournament and one goal in the semifinal match.
The United States went 2-2 in group play before topping the Czech Republic, 7-0, in the quarterfinals. The semifinal game pitted the Americans against perennial powerhouse Canada, but the U.S. came out on top with a decisive 5-1 win to advance to the finals.
The Crimson will have its top scorer back on the ice after a tough stretch of losses. Harvard went winless in December and dropped its first two matchups of 2013 to conference foes.
In his first year with the Crimson, Vesey has been a formidable part of Harvard’s offensive line. In his first outing with the Crimson, the freshman registered two goals and added an assist in Harvard’s victory against Bentley, earning ECAC Rookie of the Week honors. Vesey leads the Crimson with a team-high five goals in addition to three assists on the season. His eight point total thus far is the second highest on the team.
Harvard will next see action when it visits cross-town rival Boston University Jan. 9.

Home team knocked out of the playoffs? Still reeling from Fitzpatrick’s fourth place AFC East finish? The Back Page has you covered on who to root for, given a Harvard allegiance.
<a name=""jump"">Houston vs New England
Former Crimson football legend Clifton Dawson ’07, once the all-time Ivy League rushing leader, made his final stop of his NFL career in Houston. The Texans aren’t the only Houston franchise making headlines. Point guard Jeremy Lin ’10 has helped the Rockets to lead the NBA in points per game and currently sit in sixth place in the Western Conference. Texans linebacker <a href=""https://twitter.com/ConnorBarwin98/status/225430894385696768"">Connor Barwin was happy to lend Lin a hand when he made the move down south. We hope our alum will return the favor and cheer on the Texans.
Our pick: Houston
Baltimore vs Denver
Two prominent members of the Ravens franchise have their roots with Harvard football coach Tim Murphy. Center Matt Birk ’98 played for the Crimson under Murphy and contributed to winning three out of four Harvard-Yale contests during his time. Birk has started 113 consecutive games, the longest current streak among centers in the NFL. Baltimore coach John Harbaugh served as special teams coordinator at the University of Cincinnati for six years, four of which occurred during Murphy’s tenure as head coach there.
Our pick: Baltimore
Green Bay vs San Francisco
The Wild Card round saw the Packers down Minnesota, thus eliminating the Vikings and Kevin Murphy ’12, a member of their practice squad, from title contention. Offensive lineman Murphy, who was originally signed by the 49ers as a free agent back in May, started all 20 games during his final two years with the Crimson at left tackle and has been the only member of his class to successfully go pro. Additionally, San Francisco is coached by Jim Harbaugh, the brother of John Harbaugh. The Harbaughs are the only pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history, and we’re all for family success.
Our pick: San Francisco 
Seattle vs Atlanta
Once upon a time, Paul Allen dropped out of Washington State University and convinced Bill Gates to do the same at Harvard. The two went on to found Microsoft and now Allen is chairman of the Seahawks. Furthermore, the last time Seattle won a conference championship, it was with Isaiah Kacyvenski ’00 on its roster. Kacyvenski, who played seven seasons with the Seahawks, was signed in the fourth round of the 2000 NFL draft, the highest pick in Harvard history.
Our pick: Seattle

After No. 2 Alabama soundly defeated No. 1 Notre Dame, 42-14, in the BCS title game last night, few football analysts would object to the claim that the Crimson Tide is the best college team in the nation.
But Harvard football players may validly argue that, on paper, they could hang with Katherine Webb's boyfriend and the Toast of Tuscaloosa. How could a second-place Ivy League team in the FCS beat the best of the BCS, you ask? Well, with the help of more than a few key upsets and sixteen degrees of separation, Harvard does just that.

With the men’s ice hockey team skating on thin ice in recent matchups, the women’s team continues to dominate on the national level with a staggering 11-1-1 overall record. The Crimson has yet to fall to a conference opponent, going 9-0-0 in the ECAC.
Three Harvard standouts have been critical to the team’s success, and have found their way into the national rankings as a result. Co-captain goaltender Laura Bellamy leads the country in goals against average, having allowed a total of four goals against this season. The senior also ranks No. 1 in the NCAA in save percentage (.967).
<a name=""jump"">Freshman goalie Emerance Maschmeyer joins her teammate in the NCAA rankings coming in at No. 3 in GAA (0.99) and No. 4 in save percentage (.943). The freshman has not suffered a loss in goal thus far.
If there was a player who could beat Bellamy, it might be her co-captain. Co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey not only leads the Crimson with 16 goals this season, but the senior also leads the nation in goals per game (1.33). Dempsey is also No. 2 in the NCAA with an average of 2.5 points per game.
Dempsey registered two goals and three assists in Harvard’s last matchup against RPI on Saturday. Maschmeyer registered 19 saves against the Engineers.

The Harvard men’s hockey team might not be doing so hot, currently riding a six game winless streak, but things are looking up, or at least they are for senior Danny Biega. The defenseman was nominated for the 2013 Hobey Baker Award, which annually recognizes the top collegiate player in the country. <a href=""http://www.hobeybakeraward.com/page/show/715460-vote-for-hobey-2013-phase-i"">You can see the full list of nominees and vote for your favorite here.
The senior has been a formidable part of Harvard’s back line throughout his tenure at Harvard. Biega, a two-time first team All-Ivy selection, recorded back-to-back 30+ point seasons his sophomore and junior years, the first Harvard defenseman to do so in over two decades.
Biega has dished out four assists so far this season, including two in the Crimson’s 5-0 routing of Bentley, but has yet to find the back of the net.
Biega is one of 14 ECAC players and 10 defensemen nominated for the award. Candidates must also exemplify strength of character and integrity, both characteristics of the late Hobey Baker. Widely considered the greatest amateur athlete of the early 20th century, Baker was part of national championship squads in both football and hockey while at Princeton. He is the only person to be inducted into both the Hockey and College Football Halls of Fame.
While most of the voting is left to hockey head coaches, fans have the chance to have a say in this year’s winner through an online selection process. After the first round of fan voting ends, a semifinal list of the top ten candidates will be announced March 21. These nominees will be whittled down to three April 3, with the final recipient announced on April 12.  Fans can vote online in the first two rounds of selection.

When the Harvard men’s hockey team faces off with No. 8 Boston University on Wednesday night at Agganis Arena, not just a win, but also bragging rights, will be at stake for a pair of brothers. Sophomore forward Tommy O’Regan, who plays for the Crimson, and freshman forward Danny O’Regan, a member of the Terriers, will face off at the collegiate level for the first time.
Both O’Regan brothers, who were teammates at St. Sebastian’s School just a half hour’s drive from Cambridge, have played important roles on their respective college squads.
<a name=""jump"">Tommy has been one of Harvard’s main contributors so far this season. Although he has only one goal, the forward is tied for first on the team in assists with six. All seven of Tommy’s points came within a seven-game stretch.
In just his first season, Danny has also made a splash with the Boston University offense. The freshman is tied for second on his team with five goals, and his 11 points are tied for fourth on a Terrier squad that has played five more games than the Crimson.
In <a href=""http://bostonherald.com/sports/columnists/steve_buckley/2013/01/hockey_playing_o%E2%80%99regan_brothers_clash_first_time"">an article in Monday’s Boston Herald, the O’Regan brothers revealed that while there has been an absence of trash talk between the two leading up to the game, humor might end up playing a role in the contest.
“That’s been the running joke, that I make [Danny] laugh,” [Tommy] said in the article. “My grandfather has been saying that I’m going to go up against him in a faceoff and make him laugh and then steal the puck.”
The O’Regan family’s ties to the game don’t end with the two boys. Tom O’Regan, the father of Tommy and Danny, was born in Cambridge, starred for Boston University, and even won the team’s MVP award in 1983. The father claims he will be an impartial observer come Wednesday night.
Tune into NBC Sports Network Wednesday night at 7 p.m. to see some good old-fashioned brotherly competition at the college level.

Before the release of the 2013 Oscar nominees on January 10, the Arts Blog has compiled a list of films, actors, and actresses that either should be rewarded or that should not receive the coveted ""Academy Award nominated"" flash-and-fade on future trailers.<!--more-->BEST PICTUREShould be nominated: ""Cloud Atlas""Given the recent reshaping of the Best Picture category from five to anywhere between five and 10, this is a perfect opportunity for the Academy to surmount its decades-long discrimination against science-fiction films. While ""Lincoln"" and ""Les Misérables"" drew from the compelling, linear storylines of Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""Team of Rivals"" and the eponymous musical, respectively, the novel ""Cloud Atlas"" is only slightly more comprehensible than ""Infinite Jest."" But the fantastic direction of Tom Tykwer and the Wachowski siblings, as well as the cast's deft execution of multiple roles across six storylines, created a film grandiose as ""Tree of Life"" and as accessible as ""Skyfall.""Should not be nominated: ""Life of Pi""
Given its three Golden Globe nominations, ""Life of Pi"" will most likely appear on the ballot, and to be sure, it's not a bad film. However, just as less challenging Olympic gymnastic routines are judged out of fewer points, the narrative-driven, critically celebrated source text left the adaptation only one challenge: create beautiful visuals. Director Ang Lee delivered with apt 3-D filming, but the story suffered because the filmmakers eschewed the day-to-day sturm und drang that drove the novel in favor of visual extravagance.BEST ACTORShould be nominated: Jamie Foxx, ""Django Unchained""Since Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz switched their usual hero and villain roles spectacularly, it might be easy to overlook Jamie Foxx's subtle rendering of a modern-day Siegfried. Foxx handled excellently the layers of acting that Quentin Tarantino's script demanded as he assumed the various roles of bounty hunter, slave owner, husband, friend, and pursuer of violence with unfettered believability.Should not be nominated: Hugh Jackman, ""Les Misérables""This is the opposite of ""Django"" in that Jackman ""shines"" because of his less-than-stellar co-star. Russell Crowe as antagonist Javert looked a bit like a Pan-Am flight attendant and forgot to act, but Jackman's brassy, maniacal interpretation of Jean Valjean's tenor was equally out of place for a character who should have sounded more like he'd been beaten down by every societal force imaginable.BEST ACTRESSShould be nominated: Rachel Weisz, ""The Deep Blue Sea""Spring premieres are perilous when it comes to awards season, especially when compared to the advantages of a film that hasn't even been released yet (Jessica Chastain, anyone?). But Weisz’s meritorious portrayal of a suicidal adulterer perfectly balances the pain of her love under other characters' unspoken assumption that she dug her own grave. Her performance might be overlooked in favor of industry giants such as Dames Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Helen Mirren; however, even though Weisz hasn't been Dame'd, she certainly shouldn't be damned.Should not be nominated: Judi Dench, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel""We love Judi Dench. But her performance in ""Hotel"" is an extended study of her 2011 short film ""Friend Request Pending""—she portrays, in both, a woman of a certain age dealing with confusion about technology. The Academy has mistakenly not rewarded Dame Judi for her magnificent skill in ""Notes on a Scandal,"" ""Mrs. Brown"" and ""Iris,"" but that doesn't make her performance in ""Hotel"" any more compelling.

Having entered Wednesday night’s game at Agganis Arena winless in its last six games, the Harvard men’s hockey team scored four straight goals en route to a comeback victory against No. 8 Boston University.Down by three goals at two separate points in the contest, at 3-0 in the second period and 5-2 entering the third, the Crimson was able to storm back and tie the game up at five before regulation time ended.Sophomore forward Colin Blackwell knotted the score with less than four minutes left in the third, taking advantage his own dump pass mishandled by Terrier goalie Matt O’Connor.The teams traded opportunities in the extra frame before Harvard put the game away. Sophomore Tommy O’Regan, whose younger brother Danny suited up for the Terriers, scored one goal and assisted two others, including the game-winner. O'Regan passed puck up the ice to senior Connor Morrison, who found himself all alone in front of the net and sent a slap-shot past O’Connor for his first goal of the season.“Obviously we are pretty excited to get the win,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think a lot of our guys just stayed with it, we put ourselves behind the eight-ball early, but we were getting chances.”
On the other side, BU coach Jack Parker was less pleased with his team's performance.“I thought the way we played in the third period was a disgrace,” Parker said. “I thought the way Harvard played in the third period was a feather in their cap. They played so hard and they kept coming after us. But we just made it easier for them with the way that we played.”Entering the third period down three goals, Harvard slowly edged its way back after some motivation from the coach and some upperclassmen at intermission.“We got a little momentum, after the second we got a little fired up in the locker room,” O’Regan said. “We just said we are going to come out and we are going to win this game. We had a couple big goals and a big one at the end to tie it up and I think we just kept it buzzing into overtime.”The Crimson began to claw its way back in the third with goals at 6:38 and 8:45 from seniors Marshall Everson and Luke Greiner – the latter on a power paly - before Blackwell evened the score.BU outshot Harvard on the game, 43-35, while Crimson junior goalie Raphael Girard stopped 38 to O’Connor's 35.O’Regan added two assists and a goal, matching his brother’s point total in the first contest between the two at the collegiate level.“[Danny] got the [second] goal for them,” the elder O’Regan said. “It kind of lit a fire under me a little bit. Either way in just the game itself I was trying to compete as hard as I could…I tried not to make eye contact; I just wanted to focus on the game.”“[Danny] got three points. His brother got three points. His brother got the win, so it was a pretty good game for his brother,” Parker added. “It was a nice game for the O’Regan family.”Greiner recorded two assists in addition to his goal. Freshman Brian Hart also scored on the power play, giving Harvard two power play goals in three opportunities on the night.

Overtime has been quite the struggle for the Harvard men’s hockey program of late.The Crimson had not won a regular season game in extra time in over five years—since November 20, 2007, when Doug Rogers ’10 put home the game-winner to give Harvard a 2-1 win at BU.After that night, the Crimson went winless in its next 31 overtime matches, and it also failed to emerge victorious from Agganis Arena, home of its intracity rival and one of the nation’s best squads.But that all changed Wednesday, when six different players scored for Harvard (5-7-1) to twice help it storm back from a three-goal deficit and stun the No. 8 Terriers (11-7-0).The Crimson scored thrice in the final 15 minutes of the third period before senior forward Connor Morrison’s breakaway overtime goal with 48 seconds remaining beat Matt O’Connor and sealed a thrilling 6-5 comeback victory.
Two years ago, it was a 5-4 win over the Terriers in the Beanpot consolation game that sparked the Crimson—4-18-1 to that point—to a late-season resurgence, as Harvard went on to win seven of its next eight.The Crimson—which had entered Wednesday’s game winless in its last six—now hopes an equally dramatic and improbable win over BU initiates a similar run.“I think this group really believes in itself and things really haven’t gone their way as of a late,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s a real close group—[they] really enjoy working hard for each other—so hopefully a win like this allows them to play with some confidence.”O’BROTHER!Brothers Tommy O’Regan (a Harvard sophomore) and Danny O’Regan (a BU freshman) were both major contributors Wednesday night in their first collegiate matchup, though it was Tommy who emerged victorious.“It [was] just cool to be out there against [Danny],” the sophomore said. “That was one of the best games that I’ve played in since I’ve been at Harvard.”The younger O’Regan struck first, putting home a backdoor power-play one-timer with just 35 seconds remaining in the opening period to give the Terriers a 2-0 lead.After a Megan Wade goal put BU up three, Tommy gave Harvard its first score when he fired home a wrist shot from between the circles at the 2:29 mark of the second period.Following a power-play tally by freshman Brian Hart that cut the BU lead to 3-2, goals by Matt Nieto and the Terriers O’Regan left the Crimson in another three-score hole.But Harvard was not to be denied, rallying back from there to tie things up. Senior Marshall Everson cut the Crimson deficit to two with a backdoor goal at the 6:38 mark and classmate Luke Greiner added a power-play tally to get the Crimson within one moments later. Colin Blackwell tied the game with under four minutes to go, collecting a loose rebound in front of the net and squeezing it past O’Connor for the equalizer.

2012 might have been the most memorable year in modern Harvard sports history. Most of the memories have been positive, but there have been a few bad ones as well. A lot of these memories have come in the form of defeats at the hands of the Tigers from Princeton.
During the 2012 fall sports season, Crimson teams have fallen to the Tigers on the field, on the ice, and on the court. Whether it’s a 7-0 blowout in field hockey, or a miraculous comeback in the final frame of a football game, Princeton has somehow found a way to edge out Harvard in almost every contest this fall.<a name=""jump"">
Oct. 20th marked the dawn of the Harvard-Princeton feud this school year. In a single night, football, men’s soccer, women’s soccer, and field hockey all fell to the Tigers, perhaps initiating a string of bad juju for Harvard in Princeton contests this season.
Arguably the most gut wrenching loss occurred at Princeton Stadium. The Crimson football team had been thus far undefeated and was a favorite to win the Ivy League. The Harvard defeat was unanticipated, especially after the Crimson headed into halftime with a 20-0 lead. In the second frame, the Tigers answered two Harvard touchdowns with a total of 29 points of their own, with Princeton backup quarterback Quinn Epperly throwing a 36-yard touchdown with 13 ticks left on the clock. The final score read 39-34. The Tigers curse, which has plagued the Crimson since Doug Davis hit that buzzer beater two years ago, was here to stay.
Both Crimson soccer teams had tough bouts against Princeton, with the women falling 3-1 and the men suffering a 2-1 loss in double-overtime. The men’s match saw two late goals after a stalemate in the first 83 minutes, with Harvard and the Tigers heading into overtime, 1-1. The final goal came from Princeton forward Alex Wetermann and forced yet another loss for the Crimson on Oct. 20th.
So far the New Year has not been promising for the Crimson either, with the men’s ice hockey team falling to the Tigers 3-2 in overtime on Jan. 4th. The women’s team will face off against Princeton this Friday at 7pm. With its only loss occurring back in November against BU, No. 4 Harvard looks to finally declaw the dreaded Tigers.

Coming off of the break—without having been at the Murr Center since early December—Harvard's favored men’s squash team could have underestimated its opponent.But the No. 3 Crimson (7-0, 1-0 Ivy) did just the opposite, coming in with a competitive mentality that helped the team shut out No. 15 Bates (6-2, 1-0 NESCAC) in its third consecutive 9-0 finish and its sixth of the season. “I thought it was a job well done by the team,” co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “It was all down to business. Everyone was focused, even if they were better than their opponent.” The Harvard team, which arrived back on campus this week, quickly got back into playing form as the matches began, picking up seven 3-0 victories en route to a perfect finish. Atop the Crimson, reigning national champion Ali Farag ousted his opponent in four games, dropping only one frame to the Bobcats’ Ahmed Abdel Khalek. The junior is undefeated this season—starting four times in the No. 1 spot—and holds a perfect 19-0 collegiate record. 
“We always expect Farag to win, but he played [Khalek], and this kid is so good,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “I thought his performance was a standout from the point of view that he didn’t have his best game on the day, and he had to fight. Whenever you have a player that’s fighting through, you’re delighted.” Farag, who is from Egypt, impressed his teammates by overcoming tiredness from travel and remaining focused despite a tough opponent. “I thought it was pretty amazing, given that Ali was still pretty jetlagged, for him to play such great squash… and dig in after losing one of the first few games,” Scherl added. In the next six matches, Crimson players blanked their Bates opponents, 3-0, in each matchup. Victories by juniors Brandon McLaughlin, Gary Power, Nigel Koh, and Tommy Mullaney, sophomore Tyler Olsen, and Scherl handed Harvard an undefeated streak in the No. 2 through No. 7 slots. “I thought the team was pretty well prepared coming off the break,” Scherl said. “We haven’t been practicing at school for a while, so I thought it was good that all the players managed to stay in good form for the match.” Although the Crimson swept through the Bobcats’ lineup, each individual match was not as easy as the scoreboard suggested. “Those 3-0 matches, at least half of them were very, very close and very, very hard fought,” Way said. Playing in the No. 8 spot for the third time this season, co-captain Jason Michas maintained a perfect record for the season, defeating the Bobcats’ Jason Shrubb, 3-1. Rounding out the night for Harvard, No. 9 freshman Matt Roberts took down his opponent, Caran Arora, in a perfect 3-0 finish in which he gave up only seven points. Now nine games into a 19 game regular season, all leading up to the CSA championships in late February, the Crimson’s toughest matchups have just begun. Before the break, Harvard took down No. 5 Rochester in its most competitive game of the season, and next weekend the Crimson travels to take on rivals Penn and Princeton. “We may be at the halfway point on the calendar, but really the season—for those teams that are in contention—is just starting,” Way said. “It doesn’t feel like the halfway point at all. It feels like we are at the bottom of the main hill… the last bit of climb up Everest.”

According to the 2012 Boston Hotness Index, recently released by collegiate dating site <a href=""https://datemyschool.com/go"">DateMySchool.com, Harvard dudes are Boston's second best looking bachelors, while our ladies flank the other end of the list in last place.<!--more-->
 The rankings are a result of data based on the number of times a Date My School user saves a profile versus the number of students at the college with a profile on the site. The other five schools ranked are BC (first in both categories), BU, MIT, Northeastern, and Tufts. Yes, there are many problems with these rankings. They objectify women. They objectify men. They objectify individuals who would like to be considered hot but who identify as neither male or female. They objectify Boston's world-renowned network of universities, and the puerile bar graphs used to illustrate the data in the press release objectify the advances that have been made in data illustration since Microsoft Word 1998. But let's focus on the important take-aways, shall we? Whatever, we lost one. Fair-ish peers, they've divided us by gender, and a university divided by gender will not stand (see all Crimson content tagged ""<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/tag/Final%20Clubs/"">final clubs""). But we're doing alright. We're one of the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/12/rankings-harvard-released-week/"">hottest academic institutions right now, which is kind of related to how we have <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/tag/Fifteen%20Hottest/"">45 really hot students at Harvard right now, which is kind of like how we have 15 seniors you <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/7/harvard-most-interesting-seniors/"">need to meet right now, which is very much like <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/most-impressive-harvard-students-2012-11"">22 Most Impressive Students at Harvard Right Now. Crimson-derivative content aside (thank you, Business Insider), the numbers tend to speak for themselves, and there are a lot of them. There are, however, few conclusive numbers involved in these rankings. Perhaps an anonymous BU student (and Date My School user) said it best in a real quotation from Date My School's press release: ""Personally, I'm not surprised. The guys at my school are nowhere near as cute as the BC boys."" Which isn't to say there aren't problems with the math. If the data compiled are a result of number of saves vs. number of profiles on the site, couldn't one profile, as an outlier with hundreds of saves, skew the results? Like, one really hot guy from Harvard could swing <a href=""http://www.boston.com/yourtown/2012/12/19/boston-hottest-schools/4b3MFpxh7cdnQDqCNPgvOL/story.html?pg=14"">the results for the other 762 Harvard males who had a profile on the site when the data was collected and released by Date My School. Isn't it just generally irrelevant, anyway? Have any of you even seen AJ McCarron's <a href=""https://twitter.com/_KatherineWebb"">girlfriend? Whatever. Remember, fair peers, as the press release instructs, ""students hoping to heat up the holidays with a hottie"" are encouraged by Date My School co-founder Jean Meyer (hailed by some as ""<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/fashion/27DATEMYSCHOOL.html"">The French Zuckerberg"") to consider a date's whole character and ""'look beyond the looks.'"" But not too much, thx, because even though Meyer ""<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/fashion/27DATEMYSCHOOL.html"">believes modern ambition is the death of love,"" that's neither good for his business model nor the longevity of <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/tag/Fifteen%20Hottest/"">our most-reads.

The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team picked up its first match of the new year right where it left off.  The Crimson entered Wednesday night’s contest at the Murr Squash Center riding a three game win streak to close out its 2012 schedule.In its first match of 2013, Harvard (4-0, 1-0 Ivy) dominated from top to bottom and posted a perfect 9-0 win over Bates. The match against the Bobcats was the last time the Crimson plays at home before hitting the road to face some tough Ivy League competition.“It was good match preparation for [this coming] weekend,” co-captain Sarah Mumanachit said of her team’s outing against Bates. “We have a big one coming up. We’re on the road in some really competitive Ivy League matches. It was good to put our training to the test and switch it up from just playing each other.”It was a long winter break for Harvard, as the Crimson did not play a match for over a month.  But the team reconvened on campus earlier this week in preparation for this week’s competition. There were no signs of rust despite the time off, as Harvard failed to surrender a single game to the Bobcats, with all ten matches on the court taken by a 3-0 margin. The Crimson won every game by at least five points.“We were really pleased with the results,” said fellow co-captain Natasha Kingshott. “The Bates match was really important for us to test ourselves after the holiday break.”
It was a quick and easy win for sophomore Amanda Sobhy, who made her season debut in the number one position after being sidelined by injury in the Crimson’s earlier matches. The reigning individual national champion breezed through with 11-2, 11-3, and 11-1 wins against Bates senior Cheri Ann Parris.Fellow sophomore Haley Mendez capped a quick win with 11-1, 11-2, 11-1 victories over Myriam Kelly of the Bobcats. Mendez, who last year was named a CSA second team All-American, improved to a perfect 3-0 on the season in the number two spot.There were a few familiar faces notably absent from the Harvard lineup. Senior Laura Gemmell, who started in the number one seed earlier this year, was sidelined with an injury and forced to rest this week. But even with a few key players out, the Crimson easily handled Bates in the rest of its matches.Freshman Michelle Gemmell improved to 2-0 in her debut season with 11-2, 11-4, and 11-4 wins in the third spot. Fellow first year Isabelle Dowling is now 4-0 on the year, after taking down her opponent, 11-5, 11-6, and 11-2, in the number six position.Kingshott and Mumanachit cleaned up quickly in the number four and five matches, respectively. The co-captains posted identical 11-1, 11-4, and 11-6 wins. Fellow senior Eliza Calihan improved to a perfect 4-0 on the year with an 11-4, 11-5, and 11-3 win over Samantha Matos of the Bobcats.Rounding out the top nine, junior Natasha Anzik posted the only shutout game in the top nine matches.  She opened with a perfect 11-0 victory over Emma Kroein, then followed that with back-to-back 11-3 wins to easily take down her opponent.Playing at number 10, junior Georgiana Brinkley posted the most dominant victory of the evening.  Brinkley allowed just three points, going 11-1, 11-2, and 11-0, and improved to 2-1 on the season.The match against Bates provided a last minute tune up before Harvard hits the road to take on Ivy opponents Princeton and Penn this weekend. The match against the Bobcats marks an important milestone as the Crimson gears up for the second part of its season, where it generally faces stiffer competition against conference foes.“This is definitely the part of the season we have been looking towards,” Mumanachit said.With a conference road trip a few days away, Harvard looks to keep its unbeaten streak alive. The Crimson has not dropped a match in the top nine in any of its outing this season, having posted identical 9-0 victories in all four matches thus far.“We were really happy to have the opportunity to play Bates this week to help mentally and physically prepare ourselves for this weekend,” Kingshott said. --Staff writer Brenna R.

With Ivy League play right around the corner, Harvard leads the conference with an 8-5 non-conference record. While the variability of non-conference schedules from team to team make it difficult to judge the Crimson’s Ancient Eight competition based on their records, first half matchups provide valuable insight about the strengths and weaknesses of each team.<a name=""jump"">Columbia (8-6)
The Lions are second only to the Crimson in scoring, averaging 65.6 points per game. However, perhaps more dangerous is Columbia’s defensive capability. Led by senior guard Brian Barbour—with 13.4 points per game and 5.1 assists per game—the Lions have the best turnover margin in the conference. Barbour’s ability to control the ball while putting up big points will give Crimson freshman point guard Siyani Chambers a run for his money and keep Columbia in the hunt.
&nbsp;
Princeton (6-7)
Ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll, the Tigers have suffered a number of frustrating losses in games that they led. In December they let an 11 point second-half lead slip away in a 63-60 loss to Fordham, a team that Harvard defeated soundly, 73-64. The Tigers have been plagued by inconsistent perimeter shooting, but strong post play—most notably by senior forward Ian Hummer with 16.2 points per game and 6.6 rebounds per game—ensures that Princeton will be a contender despite its slow start.
&nbsp;
Cornell (7-9)
The Big Red has been unable to make up for its defensive lapses with a mediocre offense. The team has allowed 69 points per game—good for second to last in the league—while putting up only 64 and sits solidly in the middle of the pack in field goal and three point percentage. The team lacks an offensive sparkplug, with leading scorer Shonn Miller netting only 10.8 points per game.
&nbsp;
Brown (5-8)
The Bears have struggled to develop a physical game, failing to draw fouls and collect points from the stripe. Brown’s free throw attempts are good for last in the league, and the team hasn’t made up for it from the field, where it is shooting 39 percent. The low scoring squad has shown promising interior defense but has struggled to protect the perimeter. The Bears’ opponents have the highest three-point percentage in the conference.
&nbsp;
Yale (5-11)
The Bulldogs have taken advantage of a big frontcourt to become the highest rebounding team in the league, but they have struggled to find a defensive rhythm and are only holding their opponents to a 45.2 field goal percentage—the highest of the Ancient Eight. Leading scorers Austin Morgan (11.6 points per game) and Justin Sears (10.8 points per game) will have to do a lot more to make up for the porous Yale defense.
&nbsp;
Dartmouth (3-10)
Statistically the worst team in the league, the Big Green has been outscored by an average of 9.5 points per game so far. Despite finally snapping a seven-game losing streak with a 75-58 win over Army last week, Dartmouth is shooting a league-low 36.2 percent from the field—including 29.7 percent from deep. The Big Green’s positive turnover margin will not be enough to overcome its lack of rebounding—especially on defense—and general inability to create scoring opportunities.
&nbsp;
Penn (2-12)
Don’t count the Quakers out yet. Despite holding the worst record in the conference, Penn’s first half statistics can be deceiving. Although the Quakers have allowed the most points per game, they have held their opponents to the second lowest scoring percentage in the league and the lowest three-point percentage. With forward Fran Doughtry and guard Miles Cartwright—15.7 and 14.5 points per game, respectively—combining to form the highest-scoring duo in the Ivy League, Penn promises to be a lively matchup.

In a matchup between teams going in opposite direction, Jeremy Lin ’10 and the Rockets won their fifth straight game, 125-112, over the Los Angeles Lakers—dealing the Kobe Bryant-led squad its fourth straight loss. After recording only three points in the first half, Lin poured in 16 during the third and fourth quarters as the Rockets outscored the Lakers 66-50 in the second half. It was the third straight game that the Rockets overcame a double-digit deficit.
The Rockets rank first in the NBA in points per game and feature an MVP candidate in shooting guard James Harden but allowed the Lakers to score 62 points in the first half. However, Carlos Delfino’s four three pointers in the first half kept the score close and the team trailed by only three points at the break. In the third quarter, the Rockets outscored the Lakers by 12 points and Lin added nine points and three assists.
The Rockets are 14-6 at home on the season and have won 10 of their last 12 contests, with Harden scoring over 25 points in each game. They are within two games of the Golden State Warriors for fifth in the Western Conference, while the loss dropped the Lakers four games out of a playoff spot.
In the second quarter, Lakers point guard Steve Nash recorded his 10,000th assist, a small consolation in wake of the team’s fourth straight loss to a playoff teamfrom last year. On the heels of a 5-1 stretch that represented its best run of the season, the team lost All-Stars Dwight Howard (torn labrum) and Pau Gasol (concussion) indefinitely and while Gasol was home seeing a doctor, Howard nursed his injury on the bench in street clothes.
Lin finished an efficient 7-of-13 from the field en route to his 19 points, mixing driving layups with pull-up three pointers on the break. In the first half, Lin played more off the ball and set screens for Carlos Delfino, who hit five three-pointers in the game. Lin and backcourt mate Harden combined for 50 points, 14 assists, and 12 rebounds on the day.

Harvard men’s soccer coach Carl Junot announced his resignation Tuesday after three seasons at the helm of the team, including the most recent 2012 season that saw men’s soccer go 3-11-3 and finish last in the Ivy League with a 0-6-1 conference record.The Athletic Department said in a Thursday press release announcing the news that it had already begun a national search for Junot’s replacement.In an email sent to his team earlier this week, Junot wrote that although he planned to step down his assistant coaches would remain with the team for the rest of the year.“It was obviously a surprise to hear over break,” said men’s soccer player Joseph C. Kearney ’14. “Everyone was preparing for spring season.”Director of Athletic Communications Kurt K. Svoboda said in a phone interview Thursday that he was “a little surprised” by Junot’s resignation.
“He was here just this weekend. I didn’t talk to him, but everything seemed on the up and up,” Svoboda said. “I was just notified of this.”Before <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/7/10/msoccer-junot-071010/"">assuming the head role, Junot served as an assistant coach for the Crimson from 2008-2010. Junot finishes with a record of 10-30-11 as head coach.In a statement, Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise praised Junot’s contributions to the program.“Carl leaves a strong legacy of community service through our spring game [versus] Haiti, and an unquestioned commitment to the student-athlete experience,” Scalise said. “We wish him well in his future endeavors.”Obiajulu C. Agha Jr. '14, a men’s soccer player, said that after the team’s struggles he has mixed feelings about the coach’s resignation.“We haven’t had the best last three seasons,"" Agha said. ""I like Junot as a person—he’s done his best to help me with things outside of soccer—so I’ll miss him as a friend and as coach, but I do think it’s time to take things in a new direction.""But Connor P. McCarthy ’14, also a member of the team, said that Junot has helped set the stage for future success from men’s soccer.“We’ve definitely made a lot of strides as a team under Carl,” McCarthy said. “We’re all disappointed to see him go, but we can move forward and build upon the foundation he has set.”The department and Scalise could not be reached for further comment, and Junot declined to comment on this story.—Staff writer Jacob D.

Let the fangirl screaming begin. According to the National Enquirer, actor Robert Pattinson is considering enrolling in business school—and Harvard Business School has reportedly made his short list. The National Enquirer reported last month that Pattinson may be looking to develop his business skills in the post-Twilight phase of his career in order to ultimately move into the production side of film. In addition to HBS, he is reportedly considering UCLA, the Stern School of Business at NYU, and the Wharton School at Penn.<!--more--> While Pattinson would not be the first celebrity to take a break from life in the public eye to return to school at Harvard—<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/16/program-banks-baugher-opm/"">cough cough, Tyra Banks—Gossip Cop has <a href=""http://www.gossipcop.com/robert-pattinson-business-school-night-classes-ucla-harvard-wharton-nyu/"">rushed to discredit the possibility that R-Pattz will be following in the footsteps of Banks. Apparently, Pattinson has enough movie roles lined up for 2013 that attending business school, even during his downtime, would prove difficult for the star.
True, HBS could provide a welcome hideaway from a life in which stepping into an airport without Kristen Stewart means endless rumors of everything from either a breakup to an engagement—or both. Though Banks was initially <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/7/21/tyra-banks-hbs-dorms/"">hesitant to live in the dorms during her time at HBS, she later said that living on campus <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/17/tyra-banks-harvard-girl/"">brought her closer to her classmates. But there's one thing that everyone seems to be forgetting: R-Pattz, no matter how brooding and pensive, never attended college. Considering that HBS <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/admission-requirements/Pages/default.aspx"">requires a bachelor's degree for admission, it looks like the heartthrob may have to stick to playing brooding antiheros.A rumor like this will likely go the way of Pattinson's vampire teeth and modeling career. But on the off chance that it somehow proves true, we at Flyby predict that the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/27/hoochies-advice-harvard-season/"">Harvard Hoochies may have some competition when it comes to would-be husband hunters knocking at Harvard's gates.

During Wednesday night’s contest between the Rockets (21-15) and Hornets (10-25), the ball was in Jeremy Lin ’10’s hands early and often, but the Harvard grad failed to put up major numbers, only registering nine points for Houston in a nine-point loss.
Despite playing 42 minutes, Lin failed to reach double-digit points while his teammate James Harden tallied 25 points for the Rockets. The game marked his 14th consecutive game in which he scored at least 25 points, a new franchise record.
Although he struggled to find the hoop, Lin found other ways to lead the offense, notching a team-high five assists and a game-high five steals. He currently leads the team in assists per game (6.3) and steals per game (1.9).
Lin struggled through a scoring drought in the fourth quarter, but tallied two points for Houston with a jump shot in the final five seconds of the contest, bringing the final score to 88-79.
Lin and the Rockets face the Celtics (18-17) hoping to start another winning streak after having their five-game run snapped by the Hornets.

The man at CVS slid a yellow cardboard envelope across the counter. “Here are your photos. That’ll be $6.51.” I stared at the package. I always developed pictures in high school; why was I so wary to look at these ones? Shouldn’t I be itching to upload them in the hopes of a new profile picture, or something? I had purchased the black and yellow Kodak camera at the beginning of break with the intent of filling its 27 exposures with “memorable moments.” This winter break was the first time I would be able to see all of my high school friends who had since scattered across the country. Clutching the camera in the pharmacy checkout line, I pictured the inevitable encounters it would immortalize: a skyline from someone’s roof, a hugging gaggle of girls, a candid of someone eating at those over-priced diners we used to frequent. At home I had unintentionally slept past noon most days, then groggily combed my hair with my mother’s hairbrush before speeding to the city for yet another lunch date. The meals blended together: asking about university courses over coffee, hearing about a slew of college boys whose romantic abilities seemed firmly placed in middle school while munching on “breakfast for dinner” omelettes, exclaiming for the umpteenth time the utter necessity of visiting each others’ schools over a little illicit wine. Upon each meeting, I would at some point reveal the camera and awkwardly insist on a photo, to which my fellow diners would acquiesce.
 With my closest friends, however, the camera had seldom left my bag, its exposure count stagnant. After spending multiple days with my best friend Natalie (who happens to share my love of disposable cameras), I remembered to snap only a silly image of her sitting on the floor. While bumming around with a few good guy friends, laughing about parties and people past, capturing a picture of our time together never crossed my mind. I didn’t need to catch up with my closest friends. I received regular complaints about the nastiness of the pizza at their colleges and the surprisingly tasty desserts that sent them running to the gym; updates pertaining to romance were equally unnecessary, given the frequency of mutual consolation over late night calls and texts throughout the year. While at a New Year’s Eve get-together, a friend clicked the shutter and informed me that the camera had taken its 27th and final photo. As we all counted down the seconds to 2013, I pondered the camera and its contents. Most of the pictures featured people I was fond of, but didn’t keep up with when we were away at school. Would I still know the people in the coming year? Two years? Ten? What would happen to these friends? Would I be desperately taking photos of them five New Year’s Eves from now? “Miss? It’s $6.51.” I snapped back to the CVS counter, paid, and left. When I got home and eagerly pulled the pictures out of my bag, I was surprised at how normal they looked. They were, after all, just some shots of people whom I had laughed and cried with during high school, but who I was slowly replacing with others while away at college. I giggled to myself, suddenly unsure as to why I had placed so much salience on 27 poor-quality shots. Yet over the next few days, I found myself flipping through the photos multiple times. As exciting as it had been to leave for another state, a new school, and a different life, my need to document life back at home helped me to reconcile these binary worlds, new and old. The over-exposed, washed out, and red-eyed images would help remind me that I still had a life back in New York—one that had existed for 18 years before my new college world began. I will always be able to reminisce about these New York days when college’s sensory overload feels like too much to bear. I’ll probably continue to buy more disposable cameras, even if my friends laugh (as they are prone to) at my reliance on dinosaur technology. There is a reason our grandmas like to pull out those tiny wallet photos and show off pictures of their grandchildren. Photographs are nice.

You can’t count the Crimson out until the last whistle is blown. On Wednesday, the Harvard men’s hockey team orchestrated one of the finest comebacks in recent memory, coming back from a 5-2 deficit entering the third period to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/10/harvard-mens-hockey-BU/"">defeat No. 8 Boston University, 6-5, and snap a five-game losing streak.
In light of Harvard’s remarkable upset win, The Back Page takes a look back at some of the most memorable Crimson comebacks of the 21st century—so far.
The Game 2009: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/11/21/football-thegame-recap-112109/"">Harvard 14, Yale 10
After blanking their opponent for the first three quarters, the Bulldogs were in striking distance of an upset victory. But the Crimson—frustrated by a number of missed opportunities throughout the game—was not prepared to go quietly. With seven minutes left to play, Harvard quarterback Collier Winters found wideout Matt Luft with a 41-yard pass straight down the middle, putting the Crimson on the board and bringing the score to 10-7. Up by three, Yale chose a risky fake punt play on fourth and 22, leading to Harvard gaining possession at the 40. In crunch time, the Crimson would not falter. Winters found wide receiver Chris Lorditch on a 32-yard touchdown toss less than a minute later, cementing Harvard’s eighth win over Yale in nine years.
&nbsp;
Baseball 2002: Harvard 13, Brown 12
Down 9-2 in the fifth inning, the game was all but over. Even after battling back to tie the game at 12 in the ninth, the Crimson’s chances of victory seemed slim. With a runner on second and one out, the Bears faced captain Ben Crocket, who was brought in as a reliever after throwing 140 pitches the day before. Crocket, who had limited relief experience, picked up back-to-back strikeouts and brought the Crimson to the plate. That’s when senior first baseman Josh San Salvador—previously sidelined with a partially torn ACL—stepped in, blasting a solo homerun to clinch the walk-off victory and keep the Crimson in the Ivy League title hunt.
<a name=""jump"">Men’s Basketball 2011: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/14/mbb-recap-brown-021411/"">Harvard 85, Brown 78
Looking at the score of the February matchup, some might think it was a comfortable win for the Crimson, but the players will tell you a different story. After falling behind by 22 points in the first half, Harvard had nowhere to go but up. In the opening minutes of the second frame, the Crimson’s shots started falling, and dominant performances by Kyle Casey and Keith Wright helped Harvard methodically chip away at the Bears’ lead. The Crimson took the lead for good when Brandyn Curry—who had assisted on the previous play to narrow Brown’s lead to two—nailed a trey, and Harvard never looked back.
&nbsp;
Women’s Basketball 2009: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/5/31/comeback-game-of-the-year-22-point/"">Harvard 54, Princeton 50
After dominating Harvard and taking a 34-15 lead by the end of the first half, the Tigers never saw it coming. The Crimson team that took the court in the second very well could have been comprised of entirely different players. Gone were the harried shots, the defensive missteps, and the sloppy ball handling as Harvard crawled back to take a one-point lead with five minutes to play, but the Crimson’s work was not done. The Tigers tied up the score at 50 with under a minute on the clock, but riding Harvard’s newfound momentum, Emma Markley hit a layup to regain the lead and then grabbed a rebound on the Tigers next possession, drawing a foul. Her back-to-back free throws were the icing on the cake.

Women’s Hockey 2005: <a href=""http://www.uscho.com/recaps/2005/03/19/harvard-beats-mercyhurst-in-triple-overtime-epic/"">Harvard 5, Mercyhurst 4
Harvard hadn’t led throughout the entire game, but Nicole Corriero’s game tying goal in the opening seconds of the third period turned this NCAA quarterfinal into a war of attrition. Locked in a 4-4 tie, the Crimson and the Lakers battled through the rest of the third period and two scoreless overtime periods before Harvard finally found the back of the net in the third overtime frame—72 minutes after the tying goal. Corriero found Julie Chu in front of the Mercyhust goal, and the forward found net with a quick, backhanded shot to hand the Crimson a hard-fought victory.

Markey in the special election that will commence later this year if Senator John F. Kerry is confirmed as Secretary of State.Frank's endorsement comes as yet another small triumph for Markey, who in recent weeks has seen many prominent Massachusetts Democrats, including Victoria Reggie Kennedy and Kerry himself, voice their support for his candidacy.<!--more-->President Obama <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/21/kerry-seat-special-election/"">nominated Kerry to the post in December, and the longtime senior Senator from Massachusetts is expected to be easily confirmed in the coming weeks. Assuming confirmation, a law passed in 2006 by the Massachusetts legislature dictates that a special election must be held within 160 days to fill the seat.Frank told a <a href=""http://www.wbur.org/2013/01/10/frank-backs-markey"">Boston radio station this week that he was backing Markey in the special election not only because of his work on climate change and gun control regulations, but because, in Frank's estimation, potential Democratic challenger Rep.

After a second-place finish in the Ivy League last season, the Harvard women's basketball team will open its conference season on Saturday against Dartmouth after posting one of its best starts since the 1997-98 season.The Crimson (9-5) will look to extend its win streak against the Big Green (2-12) to six. The Dartmouth squad earned its second victory of the season during its last outing, a win at Massachusetts on Jan. 6, 57-55, snapping a 12-game losing streak in the process. By comparison, Harvard routed the Minutemen four days earlier, 86-59.“Overall we're just extremely excited to be starting Ivy League play,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “We always open up with Dartmouth and I feel like they'll give us a good game, regardless of their losing streak, because it's Ivy League play and everyone's out there to win.”The Big Green has been held to just 34.4 percent shooting from the field, sixth in the Ivy League, while Harvard tops the standings at 45 percent.Dartmouth is led in scoring by captain Faziah Steen. The 5'8” guard has put up 11.2 points per game and has grabbed 24 steals, a team-high. She is second on the team at the charity stripe, having missed just six of her 35 free throws this season.  At least one member of the Crimson squad knows how good Steen can be, as the Detroit native played high school basketball at Detroit Country Day School with Harvard co-captain Emma Golen.
“Me and Faziah go way back—we've known each other since seventh grade and she's a very dangerous player,” Golen said. “She's heated up and gotten in her zone on us in the past so our goal tomorrow is just to try and not to let her get good shots and make everything tough for her.... If she heats up she's very difficult to stop.”Steen is the only senior on a team with eleven underclassmen on its 14-woman roster. In the backcourt she is joined by sophomore Kamala Thompson and junior Nicola Zimmer. Zimmer has shot 40 percent from behind the arc, a team-high, and leads the squad in assists, with an average of 2.1 per game.The Big Green frontcourt has been led by sophomores Tia Dawson and Abbey Schmitt. At 6'2” and starting as center, Dawson has dominated the glass, grabbing a team-high 7.6 rebounds per game, and has provided defensive pressure, with 13 blocked shots to show for it. Dawson, who averages 5.2 points per contest, put up a double-double against Massachusetts, her first of the season and seventh of her career, with 12 points and 13 rebounds.Schmitt, a 6'0” forward who missed her entire freshman season with a torn ACL, is both second on the team in points per game, at 8.9, and rebounds, with 6.7.Dartmouth and Harvard have had three common non-conference opponents this year: Massachusetts, Holy Cross and Brigham Young. The Crimson defeated all three while the Big Green fell to the latter two.“As far as Dartmouth goes, that's kind of happened in the past, where they have a weaker out-of-league record but it's always a close game with them,” Golen said. “The Harvard-Dartmouth rivalry is as big as they get. Even though their record isn't the best, it's always a great game with them and they come ready to play.”In Harvard’s last outing, scoring from junior Christine Clark propelled her team to a win over Rhode Island on Jan. 6, 63-56. Clark recently joined the 1,000-point club during the win over the Minutemen. Against the Rams, Clark contributed a game-high 21 points, four more than her average of 16.6, while senior Victoria Lippert followed with 11, just under her average of 12.6.Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, the team's third leading scorer, brought down 10 rebounds versus Rhode Island. While her season average is a team-high 7.1 per game, her average over the past five games has been 9.6.Harvard will seek a third straight win against the Big Green as the team hopes to start conference play on the right foot.“It's really a big hello to both teams that the Ivy League is here,” Golen said. “It's a fight every night and anyone can win.... We're just excited to get league play started because we know that's what it's all about.”--Staff writer Cordelia Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu.

After a strong start to the new year with a win against Bates, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (4-0, 1-0 Ivy) will hit the road to face its toughest tests of the season yet. The Crimson will travel to take on No. 5 Penn (4-0, 0-0 Ivy) and No. 4 Princeton (3-0, 0-0 Ivy) in a pair of weekend match-ups. The meetings will mark the first time Harvard has competed against a top-five opponent all season. “We’ve been looking towards this weekend for weeks now,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “[It’s] probably one of our biggest weekends of the season. The Bates match was really important for us to test ourselves after the holiday break.” The Crimson had a month-long break over the holidays before heading back to campus earlier this week. Wednesday night’s match against Bates provided an opportunity to shake off any rust in preparation for this weekend’s tough test against conference foes. “We really just wanted to get back,” Kingshott said. “There’s a difference between drilling, training, and practice, and then really putting yourself on the court in an intense match situation.” 
Harvard enters this weekend’s competition with a perfect start to the season intact, having not dropped a single game in any of its top-nine matches. But the Quakers and the Tigers boast equally spotless records. Both teams have also picked up 9-0 wins against all of their opponents thus far this season.“Penn and Princeton are two pretty tough competitors,” co-captain Sarah Mumanachit said. “They have really good players in their lineup. It should definitely be a good test, but we are definitely up for the challenge.” The Crimson edged out both opponents in last year’s match ups, first taking down the Quakers, 7-2. The Tigers proved to be one of the toughest tests of the season, and Harvard squeaked by with a 5-4 victory.In this season’s go around, the Crimson will look to Amanda Sobhy for a strong start at the number one position. The sophomore made her season debut this week against Bates after being sidelined by injury in the first matches of the year. Sobhy will face a familiar foe in Julie Cerullo of Princeton. The senior, a first-team All-American, lost to Sobhy in the semifinals of last year’s individual championships. Sobhy went on to win the national title. But despite Sobhy’s return, Harvard may still have a few of its key players noticeably absent from the court this weekend. Senior Laura Gemmell, a CSA first team All-American, was forced to sit out Wednesday night’s match up and rest an injury. Gemmell started the year with a perfect 2-0 record in the number one slot. Sophomore Julianne Chu has also been sidelined for the first part of the year, but Kingshott says she hopes to make her way back into the lineup soon. “It’s tough whenever you have such a long season,” Kinghsott said. “Now that we’re in the most intense part, bodies tend to wear down. It’s difficult at this time of the year to balance intense training to push ourselves but [at the same time] not going over the limit.” The Crimson has been hard at work this past week preparing to face stiff conference competition. Without the usual distractions of schoolwork, the break offers the opportunity to get in some quality practice. “We came back at the beginning of this week and really hit the ground running with two-a-day practices,” Mumanachit said. “We’re really excited to go on the road this weekend.” This weekend’s road matches will offer the first glimpse of how Harvard stacks up against some top-tier talent. With both Penn and Princeton vying for the Ivy title, this weekend has the potential to make a defining mark on an already impressive year. “I think we’ve done incredibly well [so far],” Kingshott said. “It’s a long season, but the spirit everyday at practice is really great. We’re relishing in the fact that, right now, we are about to face some of our toughest opponents. We’re excited for it. This is the arena that we look for, to really push ourselves and see how we measure up against the very best.”

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past. January 6, 1923: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1923/1/6/picking-the-lock-pa-recent-correspondent/"">Picking the LockA recent correspondent of the Alumni Bulletin makes the rather startling suggestion that Harvard be represented next fall by two Varsity, football teams instead of one, and that while one plays Yale at New Haven the other play Yale (who is also to have two teams of course) in Cambridge, the winner being the college which amasses the largest combined score. In this way all ticket-difficulties would be abolished, and the proportion of players to spectators would be increased.

About three weeks ago a group of students who have grown to admire the Nazi leader decided to establish a club for the purpose of studying the dictator's policies. A letter was sent to the Chancellor asking for permission to use the name ""Hitler Haven.""Charles E. Schwer '37, leader of the group, received a letter yesterday from Baron von Tippelskirch, German Consul General in Boston, saying that Chancellor Hitler had asked him to inform the students that it was against his policy to authorize the use of his name for organizations of any kind.<!--more-->January 11, 1949: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1949/1/11/buck-hails-lamonts-open-shelves-plamont/"">Buck Hails Lamont’s Open ShelvesLamont Library marks a return to the belief that education is based on unrestricted access to all that humanity has thought and experienced, Provost Buck told the audience at the dedication of the new library yesterday afternoon. ""Our worser selves have had little confidence in the capacity of man to solve his fate, have treated our students as though they were children, and so have sought to substitute for free inquiry, discipline and restraint,"" he said.Buck joined President Conant, Keyes DeWitt Metcalf, University Librarian, Thomas S.

After some pious words about the ""definite necessity"" of ""self-examination,"" Mr. Eisenhower expresses himself satisfied with the results of seven years of Republican administration. The President, James Reston said last year, has touched upon all the great issues of the age and has come to grips with none of them; this record is unchanged.

After losing its top four scorers from last year’s record season, no one knew how the Harvard men’s basketball team was going to adapt.Very few people could have predicted the story of the season, a story that—as the Crimson (8-5) enters Ivy League play at Dartmouth (3-10) Saturday—has only just begun. With non-conference play coming to a close, Harvard has seen upset wins, heartbreaking losses, and production from a number of surprising sources, rookies and veterans alike.“Conference play is always different,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “No matter what opponents you face previously in [your] non-conference schedule—and we’ve had a very difficult non-conference schedule—conference play is always…incredibly challenging.”While Harvard sits atop the Ivy League based on its non-conference record, conference play changes how teams scout each other and create favorable matchups. As the Crimson prepares to take on each Elite Eight opponent twice, knowing each team’s strengths and weaknesses becomes both easier and more important.“People know you a lot better and are much more familiar with your style and your players,” Amaker said. “We know we are going to get everyone’s best shot, and we anticipate that this coming weekend.”
Entering the contest, Harvard looks like a team in perpetual transition. While freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore wing Wes Saunders—with 16.2 and 12.6 points per game, respectively—have anchored the offense all season, their teammates have stepped into a variety of supporting roles as the season has progressed.Last time out against Rice, junior guard Laurent Rivard posted a season-high 21 points, knocking down five threes. His 44 percent shooting percentage from beyond the arc is good for sixth in the Ivy League.“It was mostly in the flow in the offense,” Rivard said. “We didn’t really force anything… When other teams don’t focus on me, guys find me.”The 92-point effort against Rice demonstrated the potential of Harvard’s offense, with five players reaching double digits. Chambers posted his first career double-double with 14 points and 10 assists. The win allowed the Crimson to enter conference play on a high note after splitting its previous two games in California.“The past three games… we played a lot better than we have this year, with a lot more intensity,” Rivard said.Coming off an upset win against Cal, the Crimson let its lead against favored Saint Mary’s slip away in the last second despite career performances from Chambers—who was 5-for-5 from deep—and sophomore forward Jonah Travis—who was a force in the paint and posted a season-high 19 points.“There are a lot of bad things we could take out from [the loss to Saint Mary’s] that we have to work on in practice,” Rivard said. “It’s been a point of emphasis in practice so that something like that doesn’t happen again.”The Big Green enters the contest having snapped a seven-game losing streak with a win over Army, but the team has struggled to put points on the board. Led by sophomore forward Gabas Maldunas and freshman guard Alex Mitola—with 10.8 and 10.6 points, respectively—Dartmouth has averaged 58.4 points per game, the lowest total in the Ancient Eight.Despite lacking an offensive sparkplug to put up big points, the Big Green has been able to hold onto the ball. While Harvard has been plagued by turnovers throughout the season as it seeks to define its offensive rhythm, Dartmouth has forced more turnovers than it has given up. The Big Green’s opponents have given up the ball an average of 14.5 times per game. The Crimson has reached double digits in turnovers in 10 of its 13 games, including 17 against Rice.“We have a lot of growth to do with our younger players,” Amaker said. “I think its obvious to see that there’s a high ceiling there for our team and for a lot of our younger kids.”Much of this growth will need to come on defense, as the Crimson’s inability to make key stops late in the game has been the difference in difficult matchups throughout the season. In addition to being an offensive leader, Saunders has also begun to step into a more defensive role, taking on the opponent’s biggest offensive threat.A win for Harvard would be its sixth straight over Dartmouth.“We always talk about [how] there’s nothing better than winning on the road, and the only thing that is better than that is winning on the road in the league,” Amaker said.—Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu.

With the Harvard men’s basketball team tipping off its conference slate against Dartmouth Saturday, The Back Page takes a look at some of the biggest surprises and disappointments both at Harvard and around the Ivy League before the beginning of the conference season.<a name=""jump"">The biggest surprise of the season to date for Harvard has been freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. The Golden Valley, Minnesota native ranks first in the Ivy League with 6.0 assists a game. His 89.8 percent mark from the free throw line also leads the conference. Chambers has scored in double digits in all but four games this season and has averaged 7.2 assists over his last five games. After the departure of Oliver McNally and Keith Wright, as well as Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey, Chambers and sophomore wing Wesley Saunders have helped fill the scoring void for the Crimson. Chambers has been at his best when the team needs it most, posting 21 points, five assists and three steals in a win against ACC foe Boston College and making all five of his three-point attempts against St. Mary’s, finishing with 16 points and seven assists in a narrow loss.
The biggest disappointment of the season to date for the Crimson, has been the team’s inability to close in its few chances to notch statement nonconference wins. Against St. Mary’s, the Crimson led by as many as 18 points in the first half and 10 with four minutes to go. Against UMass, Harvard took a five-point lead on a pair of Saunders free throws with 81 seconds left but then gave up eight unanswered points to finish the game without hoisting even a single shot (the Crimson turned it over on both possessions). The team’s last chance for a marquee win comes next Saturday against Josh Pastner’s Memphis squad.
After being picked third in the conference’s preseason poll, the Columbia Lions have been the biggest surprise thus far into their nonconference slate in an Ivy League that (with the exception of Princeton and Penn, who has stumbled to a 2-12 start) stands at the onset of nonconference play almost as predicted. The Lions hold an impressive +5.4 scoring margin and lead the Ancient Eight in free throw percentage and are second in three-point percentage. The Lions rarely turn the ball over and their assist-to-turnover ratio is best in the league as a result. Despite ranking in the middle of the pack in steals and blocked shots, Columbia is the best defensive rebounding team in the league and holds opponents to just 41.7 percent shooting, a statistic that bodes well for the Lions as they begin league play next Saturday at home against Cornell.
Nearly unanimously selected to be first in the conference’s preseason poll, the Princeton Tigers have been a bit of a disappointment with a slow start to begin the season. Star senior forward Ian Hummer has produced as expected (16.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game), but the team stumbled out of the gates to a 3-6 record and only scored 42 points in an overtime loss to Wagner. The team has dropped six decisions by seven or less points, with the other being a 20-point loss to Syracuse in the Carrier Dome, but has won three of four heading into Ivy League play.

HANOVER, N.H.—“Let’s Go!” Siyani Chambers’ exclamation was audible over the crowd of 997 gathered at Dartmouth’s Leede Arena for the Big Green’s Ivy opener against the Harvard men’s basketball team.The rookie point guard had reason to be excited. After all, he had just kept the Crimson (9-5, 1-0 Ivy) from suffering its worst loss of the season in his first-ever conference matchup.With underdog Dartmouth (3-11, 0-1) leading by five with 8:43 to play, Chambers added nine points, two assists, and two rebounds in the final 7:33, fueling a 17-2 game-ending run that put Harvard on top, 75-65, at the final buzzer.“What an effort, I thought, by Siyani,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of the rookie, who finished with a career-high 22 points and six assists—both game highs,While Chambers got it done offensively, the entire Crimson lineup chipped in defensively down the stretch. After starting the second half shooting 9 of 18 from the field, the Big Green closed the contest 0 of 8—its lone points coming off two Jvonte Brooks free throws.
“I thought we dug in,” Amaker said. “We did a tremendous job of playing our D without fouling. That was key.”The Crimson also got it done on the glass. After surrendering 11 offensive rebounds over the first 31:17—which turned into 19 second-chance points for the Big Green—Harvard gave up just one down the stretch.Perhaps overshadowed by Chambers’ late-game prowess was the play of sophomore Wesley Saunders. The wing finished with 19 points on eight-of-nine shooting and matched Chambers with six assists. Saunders has scored in double-figures every game this season.Sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi contributed a season-high 15 points off the bench, and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard added 12 points, all of which came in the opening frame.Dartmouth boasted balanced scoring with seven players finishing with at least two baskets. Rookies Alex Mitola and Connor Boehm led the way with 11 points apiece.“Dartmouth is a team that we think is better than their record indicates,” Amaker said. “They’re always going to play people very, very tough, especially [at home].”Riding the hot shooting of Rivard and the play of Moundou-Missi, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead.Moundou-Missi came off the bench with 15:26 remaining and immediately made his presence felt, scoring five baskets in a five-minute stretch. His final basket of the half put the Crimson up 10, 25-15, with 10:43 to go. The Crimson took its largest lead of the period, 34-20, with 8:28 to go after Chambers knocked down a three-pointer.But it was all Dartmouth from there, as the Big Green—fueled by forward Gabas Maldunas’s four baskets—closed the frame on a 23-8 run and went into the break up one, 43-42.“We had a stretch where we didn’t play up to our standards,” Chambers said. “We can’t have those stretches.”

In the first half of its weekend doubleheader, the Harvard men’s squash team (8-0, 2-0) defeated Penn (3-3, 0-1), 9-0 at the Ringe Squash Courts Saturday. The No. 13 Quakers did not win a game against the No. 3 Crimson. Harvard travels Sunday to take on the top-ranked Princeton Tigers, who are undefeated on the year and have won each contest by a 7-2 or better margin.“I thought the team played really well today,” co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “We clearly realized that we were the favorite and the better team going into today and everyone took it seriously. We really executed our game plan on and off the court quickly and didn’t mess around.”At the top ranked spot, junior Ali Farag defeated opponent Danny Greenberg 11-1, 11-1, 11-7, surrendering the fewest points of any Crimson player on the day. Later, line three junior Gary Power and line four sophomore Tyler Olson defeated their Quaker opponents by identical 11-7, 11-6, 11-5 scores.“I look up and down the lineup and I see that every player is playing up to their potential if not above, and that’s pretty great,” Scherl said. “I can see the players coming off court and going on court and it’s a professional, mature group down the roster.”At line nine, freshman Matt Roberts scored his team-leading fifth win of the season against Quaker junior Daniel Judd. Roberts had a tight first set against Judd, winning 15-13 in what would be the closest set of the day. However, Roberts bounced back and took the final two sets 11-1 and 11-6 to close out the victory.
The win was Harvard’s fourth consecutive victory by a 9-0 margin and its seventh overall. Against Princeton, the defending national champions, the Crimson is winless in regular season play during co-captain Jason Michas’ four years with the team.“We’re very excited to play them and it’ll be a good match for us,” Michas said. “We respect how good they have been in the past and how good the players are and we know we have to play really well tomorrow to have a good result.” According to Scherl, this year’s squad—which brought back eight of last year’s top nine players—had time last offseason for an introspective look at its season and has come back with increased focus.“Last year’s team was a less mature version of this year’s team,” Scherl said. “We didn’t perform as well as we wanted last year and we talked about that with our coaches and it came down to a mindset and mental attitude that we adopted this year. I think tomorrow will be a great test and great indicator for the rest of the season for us.”The entire team, which is the largest it has been in the last four years, traveled for this weekend’s matches. Michas said that the experience of traveling with the entire team has buoyed the top nine and brought the team closer together.“This is actually a really fun trip for the team as a whole,” Michas said. “Seeing everyone who’s there at practice behind the courts cheering for us is big. We’re all digging deep in the trenches working in practice and seeing them behind us at matches is great.”Scherl said he does not see any mismatches between the two teams.“We are trying to approach it as professionally as possible and we know that if we stick to our basics that we are definitely good enough to beat this team,” Scherl said. “It’s a great team we have thus far and looking down Princeton’s lineup and looking down ours I think that there is nothing certain but we can definitely compete with them. Everyone needs to show up as they’ve been showing up recently and play great squash but I think everyone is in great form.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

 After emerging victorious from each of its first seven matches, winning by a combined score of 59-4, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team will begin the second half of its season this weekend when it travels to take on No. 13 Pennsylvania and No. 1 Princeton. The Crimson (7-0, 1-0 Ivy) has dominated its competition so far this season. Six of its wins have been 9-0 shutouts, with the remaining decision coming as a 5-4 victory over No. 5 Rochester in early December. But some of the toughest nationwide competition can be found in the Ivy League, and the heart of conference play is about to commence. “Even though we’re halfway through the season, this weekend, this is when the season really begins,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “The men have had one tough match to date…. It’s good to have a winning record and the confidence is high, but we’ve got to be tested to get deeper confidence.” 
The Crimson will travel to Pennsylvania to take on the Quakers (3-2) on Saturday. Both of Penn’s two losses have been 5-4 decisions, one of which came to Williams, which Harvard defeated, 9-0, earlier this season.The match against the Crimson will be the Quakers’ first in over a month. Penn has achieved mixed results so far this season. Senior Danny Greenberg, who has played each match at the No. 1 position, has amassed a 3-2 record on the year. Each of the players in the next three spots is 2-3. But the bottom half of the Quaker lineup has experienced much more success, as the No. 5 through No. 9 players have combined for an 18-7 record. “No one takes UPenn lightly,” Way said. “UPenn’s going to be a battle. We might be favored to win on paper, but trust me, we’re going in there with the utmost respect.” After the match with the Quakers, Harvard will make its way north to take on Princeton (4-0) in another conference showdown. The top-ranked Tigers, who are also the defending national champions, have looked hard to beat so far this year. Although Princeton has only played four matches to date, it has won each decisively, with the closest being a 7-2 victory over Rochester. Six players have played in the top five positions this season, and none of them have yet to experience defeat. “I think [the Tigers will] be a tough match,” junior Tommy Mullaney said. “Princeton’s always a tough team to play, but we’ve been training hard, and I think we’re all pretty fired up. It’s definitely one of the biggest matches of our season so far.” Senior Todd Harrity, who was the CSA individual champion in 2011 before Harvard junior Ali Farag won the title last year, leads the Tigers at the No. 1 position. Harrity is 4-0 on the season and has yet to drop a game.

The Harvard skiing team will hit the slopes for the first time this season when the alpine racers compete in the Vermont Carnival this weekend. It will be the first time the Crimson has seen competitive action in over ten months, but a veteran core of returning skiers looks to get the 2013 season off to a solid start.“Individually, everyone has just been working really hard in training,” said junior women’s captain Rebecca Nadler. “We are hoping to carry that [preparation] over to the races.”Last year Nadler became the first Harvard skier in program history to win an individual NCAA title. The junior took gold in the giant slalom at the 2012 NCAA national championship held in Bozeman, Mont. Her two-run time of 1:41.82 edged runner-up Kate Ryley of Vermont by 0.4 seconds.Nadler was one of two Crimson skiers representing Harvard at the NCAA championships. Nordic skier Alena Tofte, then a junior, had a strong finish with a 27th place showing on the 5k course and a 35th place finish in the 15k. The pair led the Crimson to a 15th place finish at the NCAA championships.Earlier in the year, Nadler became the first Harvard skier to win an EISA downhill event when she took first in the giant slalom at the Williams Carnival. Nadler finished the regular season as the East Region’s second ranked female downhill skier in the event and was named to the All-East first team.
The junior will be at the helm of a veteran women’s downhill squad, which features five upperclassmen on its roster. First year Samantha Udolf is the lone newcomer to the women’s alpine contingent.“The team has been very supportive,” Udolf said. “They’ve been greater role models for the younger guys, like myself and the other freshmen [on the men’s side].”The Vermont Carnival kicks off the Crimson’s busy regular season schedule, which features seven carnivals in as many weeks, leading up to the EISA Championships. The Nordic skiers will see their first action of the season next weekend, when both the alpine and Nordic squads make their way to Lake Placid, NY for the St. Lawrence Carnival.With the 2013 season about to start, Harvard looks to improve on its ninth place finish at last year’s EISA Championships.On the men’s side, the Crimson saw the departure of Kevin McNamara, who was Harvard’s top finisher in the giant slalom at last year’s EISA Championships, finishing 56th in the final event of his Crimson career. Ian Anderson, then a sophomore, was the top Harvard finisher in the slalom with a 48th place finish.Captain Andrew Spielvogel returns for his senior season after being sidelined by a shoulder injury towards the end of last season.While the women’s alpine roster is full of upperclassmen, the men’s side features many new, fresh faces. Spielvogel and Anderson are the only returnees and will be leading a team that features five freshmen.“We are really excited about the men’s team this year,” Nadler said. “They’ve been working really hard and have improved a lot.”Despite falling a bit earlier than usual, the Vermont Carnival will give the Crimson the opportunity to put its offseason work to the test.“Usually we have an extra week or so to prepare for our first carnival,” Nadler said. “We are all just [going to] try to do our best.”Harvard will face some stiff competition including host Vermont. The Catamounts are the reigning national champions after running away with the title at last year’s NCAA championships. Vermont’s 832.0 point total eclipsed second place finisher Utah’s aggregate score by 161.0 points.“I’m definitely looking forward to my first race,” Udolf said. “We’ve done a lot of training to prepare for our first carnival.”—Staff writer Brenna R.

After 322 days since the last time the Harvard alpine skiing team was on competitive snow, the team is back on the slopes.Key performances from rookies helped the team kick off the season when the alpine skiers made the trek this weekend to Stowe, Vt. to begin its EISA competition at the Vermont Carnival, where the team took 11th place out of 13 teams.“This is our first trial of the season, and we have a lot of freshmen where this is their first time on the carnival scene,” junior Rebecca Nadler said. ”Our men’s team had their best finish in, I don’t even know how long, and we had two men in the top 30, which was really great for us. There was a lot of soft snow, so there were a lot of big bumps and big gusts, but everyone did a really good job battling it out and working hard to get some finishes in.”Nadler, who raced to a first-ever NCAA title for the Crimson last year and helped her team take ninth at the EISA championships as a sophomore, highlighted the women’s side of the competition for Harvard, coming in second in her first race of the giant slalom event. But tricky conditions led to a tougher second run, yielding an 11th-place overall finish for the junior in the event.“[Her race] was difficult because the snow was pretty soft, and it deteriorated a lot in the second run, and that was obviously a little bit of a bummer,” Harvard coach Tim Mitchell said.
Nadler also spearheaded Harvard’s effort on the second day in the slalom race, finishing in the 14th spot out of over 80 skiers. But even with a title under Nadler’s belt and some early success, Mitchell doesn’t see anything as a given for the junior’s season.“She put down a really good time, a second-place run in the first race of the season, so that was good, but the consistency right now is not quite there from her yet,” Mitchell said. “Once she gets on track, she’ll be right where she was last year. She’s prepared very well, but you can’t control how anybody races. [There are skiers] from UVM and Dartmouth that are phenomenal, way above the level that they skied at last year, so Rebecca’s definitely capable of having the year that she had last year, but you can only control your own results.”Senior Catherine Sheils came in 39th in the giant slalom event and earned NCAA points with her 24th-place finish in the slalom race. Also contributing were sophomore Liz Strong, who took 50th in the giant slalom, and freshman Samantha Udolf, who skied to a 43rd-place finish in the slalom.“[Udolf’s] racing at a completely different level than she’s ever been exposed to, so it’s not just one step up in the competition level for her, it’s three or four steps up, so we weren’t necessarily knowing what to expect of her,” Mitchell said. “She was maybe a little bit overwhelmed, which is very easy to do since you’re racing against some people who are competing on the World Cup circuit as well as racing for their coach. It’s about the highest level of competition that you can get in any college sport, so it’s a pretty tall act for someone like her to step up.”Freshmen performances paved the way on the men’s side, where freshman Matthew Mansson qualified for a second run and placed 41st in the grand slalom, while in the slalom event, freshman Simon Merryweather and junior Ian Anderson cracked the top 30, placing 20th and 24th respectively, to earn points towards their NCAA totals. Merryweather’s finish was particularly impressive considering he started in the 76th position in the second race after a slower first run.“That’s a huge, huge move as a freshman—first collegiate race. We were really excited to see that,” Mitchell said. “Ian Anderson also finished inside the top 30, and that’s really important because when you’re finishing inside the top 30, you’re scoring points, not only for the team result, but for your own individual standing within the league, which affects your start position. That’s really important, because the later back you start, the course is kind of chewed up and bumpy and runny.”While some of the individual results weren’t necessarily what Mitchell was hoping for, he attributes some of them to the rust that comes with a late start in training that the Crimson had in comparison to UVM, which had a commanding win at the carnival with 422 points.“We’re going up against teams like UVM, which have basically been training and racing since the middle of November, and they went up to Colorado for a couple of weeks in November, and then up to Canada and skied there some more,” Mitchell said. “They’ve been going for a month and a half nonstop, so we’re definitely playing catch-up right now, and it’s pretty apparent. That being said, I actually think, given the amount of skiing we had, we’re ahead of where I expected us to be at this point.”--Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samantalin@college.harvard.edu

The Harvard women's swimming and diving team stopped in Miami, Fla. on Friday afternoon for a meet against the Hurricanes to conclude its winter break trip to Puerto Rico. The Crimson (4-0, 3-0 Ivy) topped Miami (1-5, 0-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) 175-86, winning 11 of the 14 events.""It was a fun meet because it was out of conference,"" junior captain Sara Li said. ""University of Miami is pretty challenging and they have a pretty good reputation, so to beat them was awesome. Every meet we have is practice for what we want to do for championships.""Although the Hurricanes beat Harvard in the first race, the 200 medley relay, by less than a second, the Crimson did not let that set the tone for the meet.""The first relay didn't go quite as well as we thought, but that was a good thing for us,"" Li said. ""I think it was a good way to test our endurance and make sure everyone knows that no matter what the conditions, good or bad, we just have to learn to get up and race.""Harvard came back to finish first and second in the next three events, earning at least 13 points in each one. In the 400 IM, sophomore Faith Martin stopped the clock at 4:26.33, with freshman Connie Hsu close behind at 4:27.10. Sophomore Courtney Otto and freshman Sherry Liu claimed the 200m freestyle for the Crimson with times of 1:52.55 and 1:52.91, respectively. Liu also took first for Harvard in the 500m freestyle, finishing in 4:57.73.
Freshman Kendall Crawford placed first in the 100m backstroke, clocking in at 56.27 and remaining undefeated in the event in dual meets.The Hurricanes came back in the 100m breaststroke to take first place, but the Crimson fought back to take the top three spots in the next three events, with solid performances by Otto in the 200m butterfly (2:00.41), and Li in the 50m and 100m freestyle (23.63 and 51.07, respectively).""[Miami is] definitely a very strong team and they have a history of being a really strong team,"" Otto said. ""I think that was a little intimidating for us at first, but I think we got past that a little bit because we have swum against a team of that caliber.""Junior Danielle Schulkin added to Harvard's stockpile of points with her third place finish in the 200m butterfly in 2:05.31. Senior Ellie Johnson also contributed three points in the 50m freestyle, out-touching Hannah Kling of Miami by .02 seconds with a final time of 24.32. In the 100m freestyle, Martin stopped the clock at 53.55 for her third place points, adding to the Crimson's increasing momentum.""I thought our team spirit was incredible, and we won a lot of close races, which is something we really need to do if we want to beat [other Ivy schools],"" Otto said.Harvard finished the meet by taking first in all events except the 100 butterfly.  Freshman Danielle Lee led the 200 backstroke, taking first in 1:59.87, just ahead of senior Caroline Weaver.  Weaver clocked in at 2:01.98, nearly 3.5 seconds ahead of third place.""I thought overall, we did extremely well,"" Otto said.  ""We've been coming off extremely hard training...times were not that impressive, but I think racing-wise we really came together as a team.""Sophomore Stephanie Ferrell had a strong finish as well in the 200 breaststroke (2:19.35), finishing almost five seconds ahead of senior Mackenzie Luick, who took second place for the Crimson at 2:24.69.Harvard continued to pull away from the Hurricanes with a 1-2-3 finish in the 500 freestyle.  Liu, freshman Marlee Ehrlich, and junior Deirdre Clute sped ahead to finish in 4:57.73, 5:03.36, and 5:15.45, respectively to push the Crimson ahead 16 more points.The meet concluded with a close 200 IM race and a blow-away 400 freestyle relay.  In the 200 IM, Crawford touched out Miami's Lucy Worrall by .03 seconds to score the Crimson nine points with her time of 2:06.48.  Harvard relay teams of Li, Lee, Liu, Martin and Johnson, Clute, Martin, and freshman Margaret Ramsey took first and second in the 400 freestyle relay in 3:28.37 and 3:34.11, respectively to finish the meet strongly.""I'm really proud of the team and how we're coming together,"" Otto said.  ""This whole winter break is really important in building team chemistry and I think that we're starting to come together and I'm excited to see what we do this season.""—Staff writer Chelsea Gilbert can be reached at cgilbert13@college.harvard.edu

Fresh off dominating road performances last weekend, the No. 2 Harvard women’s hockey team (11-1-1, 9-0 ECAC) looks to continue its strong start to the new year when it hits the ice this weekend, taking on two more conference foes. The Crimson will face off against Ivy foe Princeton (6-10-2, 2-8-2 ECAC) at home ice on Friday night, but the most important battle of the weekend will come the following night at Bright Hockey Center.In a battle between the top two teams in the ECAC Harvard will take on Quinnipiac (12-7-2, 7-3-1 ECAC), as the Bobcats look to overcome a one-point deficit and potentially take the top spot in the ECAC standings.The Crimson topped both the Tigers and Quinnipiac in early season road match ups.Back in October, Harvard travelled to Hamden, CT to take on the Bobcats in only its second game of the season. A power play goal by co-captain Jillian Dempsey put the Crimson up in the first period, and a second period goal by sophomore Hillary Crowe sealed the 2-0 shutout victory.Quinnipiac, however, have picked up some steam since the start of its season. The Bobcats enter this weekend’s match-up riding a five-game win streak, fresh off a 4-1 victory over McGill to start off 2013.
Quinnipiac junior Kelly Babstock leads the ECAC with 20 goals so far this season, but the Crimson looks to counter with its characteristically strong defense. Goaltenders Laura Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer have split time between the pipes for Harvard. The two are arguably the top goalies in the ECAC; Bellamy leads the league in goals-against (0.60) and save percentage (.967), with Maschmeyer a close second in both categories. Maschmeyer leads the ECAC with a .917 win percentage while Bellamy is second at .857.Another strong contributor on the defensive end will be sophomore Sarah Edney, who missed the Crimson’s most recent outings while playing for the Canadian Women’s Development Team in the 2013 Meco Cup at the turn of the year.“We’re pretty excited to have [Edney] back,” Bellamy said. “Our defense has been playing great without her, but to have her back will be huge.”On the other end of the ice, Dempsey has been the primary source of offensive firepower this season for Harvard, leading the team with 16 goals and 15 assists on the year. According to the senior, keys to a successful outcome for the Crimson in this weekend’s test will be continuing its strong defensive play of late as well as both creating and capitalizing on scoring opportunities.“We’re going to need to get on them right away,” Dempsey said. “It’s going to be really gritty and tough. We have to put pucks on net, to create havoc and better scoring opportunities.”“We’ve been putting an emphasis on winning every battle,” fellow co-captain Bellamy said. “We want to come out on top with the puck every chance we get.”Even with a big match-up against Quinnipiac in sight, Harvard will not be overlooking its first opponent of the weekend. The Crimson’s first outing of the season at Princeton ended in a commanding 9-1 victory for Harvard. Junior forward Lyndsey Fry picked up a hat trick, and Dempsey added two goals of her own. But despite the resounding win, the Crimson is sure to avoid underestimate the Tigers.“I think that they’re going to come out even harder,” Dempsey said. “If they weren’t already going to be hungry because it’s a game and it’s against Harvard, they’re definitely going to have that bitter taste from the last time we played them.”This weekend’s matches will both be solid tests for the Crimson, as Harvard looks towards the second half of the season and some tough games against ECAC foes.“There is so much positive energy,” Dempsey said. “The discipline and the hard-work ethic is probably one of the best in my four years here.  I’m really confident in this team, and I have a lot of faith in what we can accomplish this year.”The Crimson has steadily climbed the national rankings due to its impressive play this season and looks to be a legitimate threat come the end of the year with an eye on postseason play.“If we stay consistent, and keep having that same mentality and urgency for every single game, every period of every game, I think we can find ourselves in a really good position at the end of the season and definitely make a run at this NCAA title,” Dempsey added.—Staff writer Brenna R.

American University edged the Harvard wrestling team, 21-19, in the Crimson’s EIWA dual meet opener Friday night in Washington, D.C. Harvard (1-1, 0-1 EIWA) took five matches on the night but dropped three of the last five as the Eagles (2-2, 0-1 EIWA) captured the home win.“This match, we had a couple slip-ups,” said sophomore 197-pounder James Fox. “Some things just didn’t go our way in bonus points and at the end of the match.”After his second week back on the mat after a two-month injury, Fox recorded his first individual win of the season Friday night with a 15-2 major decision over American’s Devon Bradley. The sophomore 197-pounder bounced back after a slow start to his season against Rider last week.“[Fox] is 100-percent different from last week,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We missed him last semester. [His] coming back is great; he looked really good.”“This week, I felt a lot better going into my match,” Fox added. “It was just another week under my belt, and my body got used to the intensity of wrestling again.”
Fox forced Bradley to the edge of the mat in the waning stages of the fifth bout of the meet, but the technical fall eluded Fox as time expired.“I kept going for the pin,” Fox said. “I really wanted that; two extra team points might’ve been the difference tonight.”Fox’s bout gave the Crimson the largest lead of the night on either side as Harvard enjoyed a 13-6 lead as the teams headed into the back half of the meet. But American closed the gap with a pair of wins in the following two matches.Eagles heavyweight Blake Herrin defeated Harvard sophomore David Ng, 12-5, to inch within four points of the Crimson.“David Ng wrestled a tough bout; their guy [Herrin] is tough,” Weiss said.American followed up the decision with a pin. 125-pounder David Terao recorded a fall over Harvard freshman Jeffrey Ott midway through the third period to put American up, 15-13, with three bouts left. Ott could not escape Terao’s headlock midway through the third.“I think the key bout was 125,” Weiss said. “[Ott] wrestled a great bout. He was winning the bout deep into the third period. But he gets caught in a headlock, and that’s a nine point swing.”Harvard made a final push in the eighth and ninth bouts. Sophomore 174-pounder Ryan Osleeb won a 4-2 decision over American’s Esteban Gomes-Rivera, and No. 10 co-captain Steven Keith defeated the Eagles’ John Boyle, 4-1, in the 141-lb. division to put the Crimson ahead, 19-15.But the two decisions could not outweigh a fall from Eagles 149-pounder Kevin Tao over Crimson sophomore Alexis Wagener in the tenth and final match. The pin swung the contest to American, 21-19.“I love putting [Wagener] on the mat because I know he’s going to be trying,” Weiss said. “That was a tough one, but we didn’t put together as a team, and we’ve got to figure that out.”

Friday night’s matchup pitted two teams on almost opposite journeys. The overhauled Houston Rockets came into the season expectation-free after shaking up their starting lineup but got off to a hot start nonetheless.
But the upstarts couldn’t contend with a veteran Celtics team fighting on its home court to redeem itself after a slow start to the season, as Houston fell, 103-91.
The Celtics had to fight for their victory after almost letting a 17-point lead slip away in the fourth quarter. Sparked by a Carlos Delfino three-pointer, Houston went on a 12-0 run to pull within two. However, the Rockets couldn’t keep up their offensive pace, and they were outscored 20-10 to close out the game.
Both teams struggled from the foul line—with Boston never reaching the stripe in the first half—but the Celtics made up for it by knocking down 75 percent of their free throws in the third and fourth quarters, while the Rockets shot only 41.4 percent from the stripe throughout the game.
Lin—largely kept from the paint by a strong Celtics defense—added 12 points behind teammates Harden and Chandler Parsons, who led the team with 24 and 18 points, respectively. The guard was crucial on defense, tallying a team-high three steals and six assists, while adding four defensive rebounds in 36 minutes of play.
In the Celtics’ fifth straight win—their longest winning streak of the season—Paul Pierce led the team with 23 points. Boston also benefited from a deep bench, which outscored the Rockets’ bench by almost 100 percent, adding 40 points to Houston’s 25.
After winning five straight and 10 of 12 before suffering back-to-back losses at the hands of the Hornets and the Celtics, the Rockets will seek to right the ship against the 76ers tomorrow evening.

Two Harvard athletes were named to Business Insider’s list of the 22 most impressive students at Harvard on Tuesday. <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/most-impressive-harvard-students-2012-11?op=1"">The list, which features predominantly seniors, includes cancer researchers, business founders, and published writers.
The list recognized alpine skier Rebecca Nadler, who made history last year when she became the first Harvard skier to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/10/rebecca-nadler-skiing-national-championship/"">win a national title. In her years as a Crimson skier, the junior has taken the alpine program to new heights, handing Harvard its first EISA carnival win and becoming the first to attend NCAAs.
In her quest for the title, Nadler edged rival Kate Ryley of the University of Vermont by .38 seconds, cruising to victory in the giant slalom with one of the widest margins in recent NCAA history.
In addition to Nadler, the list highlighted senior running back Treavor Scales, who was also <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/6/15-most-interesting-scales/"">named one of the Crimson’s 15 seniors to meet before they graduate. Scales is best known for his heroics on the field, most recently a 63-yard touchdown run to hand Harvard its <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/17/harvard-football-the-game-yale-ivy-league-harvard-stadium-murphy-reno/"">sixth straight victory over Yale in November.
Scales’ flashy ending was just another demonstration of what he did for Harvard football his entire career. Scales made the all-conference team four straight years, leading the league in rushing as a senior.
In addition to Scales’ football career, Business Insider focused on the running back’s academic pursuits. In earning a German language citation, the economics concentrator performed in a play last spring for his German Drama and Theater class and is also involved in DAPA.

As Penn threatened to erase Harvard’s early 3-0 lead, senior Laura Gemmell faced a 2-1 game deficit at the No. 2 position. But the Crimson senior rallied with a hard-fought 11-9 victory in the fourth game and a commanding 11-4 win in the fifth to place Harvard firmly in control of the team match with its fourth point of the day.Thanks to Gemmell’s performance, the No. 1 Crimson women’s squash team won its most challenging match yet this season against the No. 5 Quakers, 6-3, Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia. Harvard (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) yielded its first individual matches of the season but managed to hand Penn (4-1, 0-1 Ivy) its first loss.“As a team, we’ve been looking to this match for the last couple of months,” co-captain Natasha Kinshott said. “We all really rose to the occasion.”Harvard swept the first wave of individual matches at the No. 3, No. 6 and No. 9 positions.At the No. 3 position, sophomore Haley Mendez secured Harvard’s first of two five-game victories. Mendez earned consecutive 11-4 wins in her fourth and fifth games to deliver a 3-2 win over Penn’s Rachael Goh, 7-11, 12-10, 2-11, 11-4, 11-4.
At No. 6, Kingshott earned a clean decision over the Quakers’ Yarden Odinak, winning in straight games, 11-2, 11-7, 11-9. The senior entered the match with something extra to prove.“I’ve played [Odinak] since I was playing in my junior circuit, so I know her game very well.” Kingshott said. “I hadn’t beaten her in a couple of years, so I was really motivated and focused on this match in particular because of the history.”Sophomore Julianne Chu also went wire-to-wire for Harvard, defeating freshman Alisa Agnew in straight sets, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8, at the No. 9 position.Penn responded with a pair of four-game victories over Harvard freshmen in the next wave of matches. At the No. 5 position, Quaker senior Pia Trikha defeated Saumya Karki, 8-11, 11-6, 11-9, 11-5, and Penn freshman Camille Lanier defeated Isabelle Dowling, 11-6, 8-11, 13-11, 11-4, at No. 8.“I’m really proud of the freshmen in particular,” Kingshott said. “Even though the scores of their particular matches may not reflect their results, they fought so hard.”Harvard’s third loss of the day also involved two first-year players. Crimson freshman Michelle Gemmell climbed out of a 2-0 hole to force a fifth game but fell to Quaker freshman Haidi Lala, 11-5, 11-9, 12-14, 9-11, 11-4.“[Michelle] played well; she had a tough match,” Laura Gemmell said of her younger sister. “I think she is going to build on this tomorrow [versus Princeton].”Harvard sealed the match with a pair of come-from-behind wins at No. 2 and No. 7.Laura Gemmell took freshman Yan Xin to five games at the No. 2 position to earn the Crimson’s fourth point of the match, 9-11, 11-5, 6-11, 11-9, 11-4.“Laura dug really deep,” Kingshott said. “You could see that she was really fired up.”“I had beaten [Xin] in October, but I knew she was going to be a very strong opponent,” Gemmell added. “I was really happy with the way I played. I kind of just grit it out and tried to return as many volleys as possible.”At the No. 7 position, co-captain Sarah Mumanachit spotted Penn’s Courntey Jones a game but took control in the next three to produce the clinching fifth point, 8-11, 11-6, 11-9, 11-5.“[Mumanachit] really hustled and never gave up,” Kingshott said. “It was just so gratifying that the two other seniors—Laura and Sarah—got the two victories for us that clinched the win.”The day concluded with a drama-free match at No. 1 as sophomore Amanda Sobhy rolled over Penn’s Nabilla Ariffin. The reigning individual national champion cruised, 11-3, 11-4, 11-3, to record Harvard’s sixth and final point of the day.—Staff writer Michael D.

Unless you've been in a coma for the past ten months, you've probably heard about ""Girls,"" which premieres its second season tonight on HBO. You've also probably heard as much about the polarized opinions surrounding Lena Dunham—the show's 26-year-old writer, director, executive producer, and star—as you have about the show's portrayal of hookup culture and twenty-something life.<!--more-->Twenty-nothing life would be more appropriate; the show is as bleak as it is witty. Dunham's depiction of New York City presents a stark contrast to the glittery, urban playground of ""Sex and the City""—these girls are more likely to pregame with PBR than with 10 dollar cosmopolitans. The <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/girls-the-year-in-lena-dunham.html"">maelstrom of criticism and praise that has surrounded the show, impressively, makes the obsessive navel-gazing of its characters look like normal introspection by comparison.Perhaps the intense media chatter is due to the fact that ""Girls"" is one of the first shows to hold a (decidedly unglamorous) mirror up to current young adult life—and perhaps the vitriol is a knee-jerk reaction to disliking this reflection.It's also possible that the controversy comes as a result of the fact that Dunham herself leads a life that's a far cry from those of her characters, being much more successful and ambitious than they are. Additionally, Dunham has been the lucky recipient of numerous irrelevant and depressingly sexist personal attacks, most notably regarding her weight. An ambitious woman? Oh no! A full-figured woman in a nude scene? The horror!There's also the part where all the girls of ""Girls"" are white, which hasn't sat well with many bloggers and critics. But the reality is that the majority of television shows are primarily populated by Caucasians.

For the second time in four days, the Harvard men’s hockey team found itself making a late upset bid against a ranked opponent on the road.But unlike on Wednesday against Boston University, the Crimson’s comeback attempt fell short against No. 12 Dartmouth Saturday night, as a Jesse Blemish goal with under eight minutes remaining gave the Big Green a 3-2 win at Thompson Arena.The defeat marks Harvard’s sixth in its last eight games and fourth straight against an ECAC opponent. The free-falling Crimson (5-8-1, 3-6-0 ECAC) now finds itself tied for second-to-last place in its conference midway through the season.“It was a back-and-forth game,” junior defenseman Dan Ford said. “We didn’t play poorly.... It was just a tough Ivy League road game, a one-goal game, [and] Dartmouth made the plays that they needed to [make] to get the win.”After Harvard rallied to tie the game at two, Beamish scored the go-ahead goal—the first of his career—with 7:29 remaining, tipping a Ryan Bullock shot past Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard to send the home crowd of over 4,000 into a frenzy.
Despite a late push, Harvard could not find an answer before the final horn.“Dartmouth’s a good team,” Girard said. “We sure could have gotten the win out there, but hockey is a game of mistakes.... We can definitely skate with those guys.”After denying an abundance of early pressure on Girard, the Crimson got on the board first—something it had not done in its last three contests.At the 13:22 mark of the first period, forward Jimmy Vesey weaved his way through a trio of Big Green (9-5-2, 5-3-1) defenders before scoring from just outside the crease while moving right-to-left.It was the team-high sixth goal of the season for the rookie, who missed two games last week while playing for the United States at the World Junior Championships in Ufa, Russia.“Even though [Vesey is] a great player, we can’t just rely on him because he’s only a freshman,” Girard said. “But it was really nice to have him back to create some offense.”The Harvard defense kept the Big Green off the board for the remainder of the opening period, but Dartmouth’s Matt Lindblad tied things up just over four minutes into the second. During a four-on-four set up by a Vesey facemasking penalty, Lindblad put away a rebound to tie the game.“They’re a really good transition team,” Girard said. “They want to have some four-on-fours on power plays.... [It gives them] more room on the ice, so it allows their power play to work better, which gives them more chances and more momentum.”Four minutes later, with 29 seconds still remaining in the major penalty, Nick Bligh put the Big Green ahead, 2-1, with a power-play goal.After a shot by the hero of Wednesday’s game, senior forward Conor Morrison, hit the post at the period’s end, Dartmouth took that lead into the final period.

HANOVER, N.H.—Despite leading a team that occupied the bottom spot in the Ivy standings in 2011-12 by as many as 14 points in the first half, the Harvard men’s basketball team gave up its advantage just before the break on Saturday, entering the locker room down one, 43-42.After a back-and-forth second period, the defending Ancient Eight champions were able to erase the small deficit and pull away, 75-65, but—like so many contests at Leede Arena—it didn’t come easy. The second half featured six ties and five lead changes, with neither team going ahead by more than five until Harvard (9-5, 1-0 Ivy) scored eight of the last 10 to claim the final, 10-point advantage.“We hit a stretch where we didn’t play up to our standards,” said freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who scored a game-high 22 points. “We relaxed, didn’t play good defense, [and] we didn’t get any rebounds…. Other than that stretch, I think we played pretty well. But we can’t have those stretches anymore.”Although the Crimson has topped the Big Green (3-11, 0-1) in its last seven contests and holds a 9-2 record against Dartmouth with coach Tommy Amaker at the helm, Harvard has traditionally struggled in contests played in Hanover.The Crimson has held the advantage in both locations under Amaker, but the average Harvard margin of victory at home is 14.2 points compared to 4.8 at Leede Arena. Last year, although the Crimson eventually claimed a 54-38 victory, Dartmouth got within five points as late as 13:35 in the second half of the road game. In 2010, Harvard escaped Hanover with a four-point win after trouncing the Big Green by 29 in their matchup at Lavietes Pavilion.
“For whatever reason, many Harvard teams have never fared very well coming here to play,” Amaker said. “It’s always been games like this where you’re trying to figure it out, or games like this where you don’t come out with a victory.”STEVE’S JOBSWith 1:36 to play in Saturday’s contest, forward Steve Moundou-Missi slammed the ball through the basket, giving his team an eight-point lead and adding an effective exclamation point to a career night. The sophomore scored a season-high 15 points on seven-of-nine shooting.“I thought his play and his minutes were tremendous for us to give us the boost that he did,” Amaker said.After entering the contest with 15:26 left to play in the opening frame, Moundou-Missi quickly made an impact, finishing his first layup of the night just 15 seconds later off a pass from co-captain Christian Webster. Moundou-Missi scored nine of his team’s next 15 points, amassing 11 in a stretch on the court that totaled just over five minutes.Aside from a single made free throw to capitalize on an and-one opportunity midway through the first half, Moundou-Missi scored all of his points in the paint, including three dunks over the course of the night.“We needed his energy around the rim to finish the basketball [and] to defensive rebound for us,” Amaker said. “I thought his minutes and his presence were outstanding.”The sophomore contributed a game-high six rebounds—two on offense—in 24 minutes of action. Before Saturday’s matchup, Moundou-Missi averaged just under 16 minutes per game on the season.ADJUSTMENT BUREAUAfter a first half laden with defensive struggles on both ends of the court, Dartmouth and Harvard each made successful adjustments on defense for the second period.

The No. 2 Harvard women’s ice hockey team extended its unbeaten streak to 11 games with an easy 4-0 win over Quinnipiac Saturday.In its second straight shutout—and eighth of the season—the Crimson (13-1-1, 11-0 ECAC) came out firing and didn’t slow down, handing the Bobcats (12-9-2, 8-5-1 ECAC) their second consecutive conference loss.Since opening its season with a 2-0 win over Quinnipiac, Harvard has consistently sat atop the ECAC standings, but the Bobcats—who were in second place coming into the matchup and have now dropped to third—had a chance to jump into the top spot with a victory. A repeat performance of the shutout in October ensured the Crimson sole possession of the league lead for another day.“We’re better now than we were then,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We played good defense, we had good goaltending, and we worked our way up the ice. We used our speed last night, so that made a big difference.”It took Harvard 10 shots to find the back of the net and break the 0-0 tie.  With less than three minutes left in the first period, junior forward Kalley Armstrong picked up the rebound off a shot by co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey and beat Quinnipiac goaltender Victoria Vigilante for Armstrong’s sixth goal of the season.
The Bobcats senior goaltender was a presence in the goal, making 26 saves as the Crimson pounded the net. Despite laying out and making tough stops that kept Harvard off the board for most of the first period, Vigilanti couldn’t keep up with a dominant Crimson offense.From the first goal on, the Crimson dominated the possession game, outshooting the Bobcats 30 to 18 on the night. Dempsey added her 18th goal of the season early in the second period, receiving a pass across the goal from junior forward Lyndsey Fry that sent Vigilanti sprawling. A quick slap shot put Harvard up, 2-0.“We played really well as a team,” said Fry, who had two assists in back-to-back games for the first time this season. “We got the shots through that we needed to get through and had people going really hard to the net.”Five minutes into the third period, the Crimson once again took advantage of a loose puck when freshman forward Miye D’Oench found the net after a shot deflected off Vigilanti’s pads. Nine minutes later, D’Oench fed sophomore forward Samantha Reber to cap off Harvard’s four-point win.“[The back-to-back wins are] obviously a great way to start the New Year,” Fry said. “We’re definitely showing our league as well as the rest of the country that we’re not stopping just because it’s the New Year. We’re going to keep going, and these wins were huge.”Freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer tallied 18 saves en route to her third shutout of the season. Maschmeyer’s 95.1 save percentage is second in the nation, behind only co-captain Laura Bellamy.The Crimson failed to convert two power play opportunities but continued to look invincible in the penalty kill with a perfect 4-for-4 record. Quinnipiac’s best look came midway through the third period with sophomore defender Sarah Edney in the penalty box for hooking, but Maschmeyer and the Harvard defense fended off four consecutive shots by the Bobcats to improve its nation-leading penalty kill percentage to 96 percent.Despite having dismantled its ECAC opponents thus far—outscoring them 49-4—Stone emphasized the importance of not discounting any team. The matchup with the Bobcats was the 16th of a 30-game season, and Harvard has 11 conference contests left to play.“Every game is critical to us, and we take them one at a time,” Stone said. “We don’t look past anybody, and I think that’s what keeps up playing in the moment. It’s a long season, and if you get too far ahead of yourself, that’s when you get yourself in trouble.”Coming off Friday’s 3-0 win against Princeton, Stone said that she was happy to see the level of play improve. Despite getting the win, the Crimson struggled to create scoring opportunities, a far cry from its 9-1 rout of the Tigers at the beginning of the season.“Our goal today was to be better than we were yesterday, just as it is to be better on Tuesday than we were today,” Fry said. “A cool thing about hockey and our league is that on any given day, anybody can win, and that’s why we have to work for everything we get.”—Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu.

To wrap up its two-day trip to the nation’s capital, the Harvard wrestling team made the short drive to College Park, Md. to take on No. 23 Maryland and Stanford in two dual matches.After losing, 21-19, to American on Friday night, the Crimson opened up on Saturday against the Terrapins. Despite having the lead at the midway point, Harvard was unable to hang on, falling by a final of 22-14.But the Crimson stormed back a few hours later and dismantled the Cardinal to coast to a 28-9 victory.“I think that we wrestled really well this weekend,” co-captain Steven Keith said. “The loss to Maryland was a tough, close match where a couple things could’ve gone differently, and we [would have won] that match against the No. 23 team in the country. We rebounded really well and just annihilated Stanford, so it was a really good way to finish the weekend.”Harvard received solid performances from Keith and fellow co-captain Walter Peppelman, who both went undefeated on the day. The only seniors to take the mat, Keith contributed a shutout and a fall, and Peppelman demonstrated similar consistency to win his matches by a combined score of 21-2.
“[Keith and Peppelman] both wrestled strong,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “I tell the seniors, this is the last time they’re doing this, so you have to treat every time like it’s the last time, and they’re doing that. They’re doing a nice job.”HARVARD 28, STANFORD 9A team effort from start to finish gave Harvard its sole victory of the weekend. The outcome was all but decided by the midway point, as the Crimson held a commanding 17-3 lead over Stanford.Harvard would go on to further expand its lead, ultimately winning by 19 points. The 28 points were the most scored by the Crimson since Jan. 7 of last year and came after two consecutive losses.“It’s a huge thing to learn [how to bounce back],” Weiss said. “When we get into tournament situations, you have to be able to push that away and have a short term memory. They really wrestled a lot better [against the Cardinal].”Harvard won seven of the ten bouts, and held Stanford to three-point decisions in its three losses.Every match, with the exception of Keith’s, who achieved a fall, went the distance, and Crimson wrestlers took advantage of a number of takedowns to keep the scoring high and secure bonus points for the team.Peppelman, junior Cameron Croy, and sophomore James Fox all secured major decisions and held their opponents to three points or fewer. Keith’s fall at 2:00 racked up even more bonus points.The victories were the 98th and 94th career wins for Peppelman and Keith, respectively. The two co-captains currently rank sixth and seventh on the program’s all-time wins list.MARYLAND 22, HARVARD 14

Saturday night’s contest between the Houston Rockets and the Philadelphia 76ers saw two teams both looking to end skids.
After ringing in the New Year with a victory over a struggling Lakers team, Philadelphia had been unable to notch another game in the win column, while Houston looked to end its own streak of back-to-back losses. With a little help from a three-day break and poor defense by Houston, it was the Sixers that snapped its five-game losing streak, topping the Rockets, 107-100.
Jrue Holiday put up the first five points for Philadelphia and never looked back, finishing with a game-high 30 points on 11-of-22 shooting. The Sixers led by as much as 14 in the third quarter, but James Harden brought Houston within three with six minutes to go.
But the effort by the guard, who led the Rockets on the night with 29 points and nine rebounds, wasn’t enough as Houston missed its next eight shots to allow Philadelphia to take the win.
Jeremy Lin '10 had a +/- of +8 but failed to be as efficient as his teammates when he was on the court, only sinking two of his 13 shots for seven points. The Rockets struggled from downtown, missing 24 of 32 attempts, including eight consecutive misses in the final frame. Lin clanged all three of his treys while teammate Chandler Parsons netted only one of his seven attempts behind the arc.
With the loss, Houston, which played its fourth game in five days, falls to seventh place in the Western Conference, eight games behind the first-place Thunder.

The Harvard women's basketball team earned its sixth straight win against Dartmouth on Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion. A combined 41 points from junior Christine Clark and senior Victoria Lippert powered their team over the Big Green (2-13, 0-1 Ivy), 88-66. The Crimson (10-5, 1-0 Ivy) led by as much as 31 points in the victory.“The game itself I thought was really great,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “We came out strong and I thought we fought the whole time. Dartmouth always gives us a good run for our money during Ivy League conference play.”Clark recorded a game-high 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting and was a perfect five-for-five from the charity stripe. Lippert contributed 19 and hit all three of her free throw attempts. She sits atop the Ivy League in free throw percentage at 89.2 percent.The third double-digit scorer for Harvard was freshman guard Shilpa Tummala, who put up 10 points in her Ancient Eight debut, a career-high. The 5'11” rookie entered the game late in the first half and played for just eight minutes total, but shot 4-of-4 from the field, including two three-pointers.“It was nice to finally start clicking for myself on the court,” Tummala said. “It made me feel a little more confident. My teammates definitely have helped with that and are always pushing me in practice and helping me stick through it.... It felt good to be able to help contribute to the team in whatever way I could.”
Tummala, who was two-time captain at St. Mary's High School which was ranked No. 1 by ESPN, scored her first career basket Jan. 2 against Massachusetts.“Shilpa is a great player,” Curtis said. “Coming in she had great stats. She had a good following through high school. We knew she was going to be an integral part of our team and coming off the bench last night she was feeling good, feeling confident. She didn't even look at the basket when she shot—it just always seemed to go in and it was great for her.”In addition to Clark and Lippert's performances, it was a strong day for the bench, which contributed 37 points total. Junior guard Jasmine Evans notched eight points while junior center Elise Gordon and senior guard Elle Hagedorn each chipped in six. Hagedorn handed out a team-high four assists, while Curtis added three.“That in itself shows just how deep our team is, how much everyone wants to win and how important this conference title is to us,” Curtis said. “It was awesome to see everyone get out there, really have fun, and play the game that we love.”For Dartmouth, its sole senior, guard Faziah Steen, was the dominant shooter of the day. Playing for 34 minutes, she tallied a team-high 18 points and provided defensive pressure, recording a game-high five steals. Steen was followed by freshman Lakin Roland who put up 13 points, and sophomore Tia Dawson, with 10. Dawson was aggressive on the glass, pulling down a game-high nine rebounds.While Steen drilled an early jumper, it was a pair of Harvard seniors, Lippert and Crimson co-captain Miriam Rutzen, who led the home team on a 13-2 run in the first five-and-a-half minutes of play to bring Harvard out to an early lead it would never relinquish. The team would head into the locker room 16 points on top of its opponents. While hot shooting by Steen and Roland would cut the lead to 11 at its smallest halfway through the second frame, the Crimson went on a 12-0 run to widen the gap and eventually seal the win.The Crimson hit a total of 10 treys and was able to keep the turnovers down to just nine, below its season average of 17.4 per game. The squad out-rebounded the Big Green, 42-32, with Clark, Lippert and Rutzen each grabbing seven boards. The win is Harvard’s third straight and improved the team to 5-0 at home.“I think it's just a great start to the Ivy League and sends a message to rest of our team that we're able to take on the conference and do the best we possibly can,” Curtis said.--Staff writer Cordelia Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu.

Its that time of year again…
Yes, it’s the NFL playoffs. But if you kept watching CBS after the Patriots-Texans game, you probably caught a glimpse of the Golden Globes and realized it’s awards season as well. With Argo and Les Mis winning big last night, the SAG Awards less than two weeks away, and the Oscars in sight shortly after the Super Bowl, it’s only fitting that The Back Page sees who brings home the hardware amongst Harvard’s cast and crew.
<a name=""jump"">Best Actor (Male Athlete): Colton Chapple.
CFPA Quarterback Award, George “Bulger” Lowe Award, Asa S. Bushnell Cup, Division I FCS Gold Helmet. Chapple is raking in the year’s top honors after a stellar senior season. He was a shoe-in to win this one as well.
 
Best Actress (Female Athlete): Jillian Dempsey
The forward gets the nod based on her outstanding performance anchoring the Crimson to its 13-1-1 start this year. In her swan song season, she leads with a team-high 18 goals and 16 assists.
Breakthrough Performance of the Year: Siyani Chambers
The freshman has stolen the show with his play thus far this season. He’s averaging 13.3 points per game and has dished out a team-high 6.0 assists per contest. They say big actors demand big roles, and Chambers has no problem stepping up in the most critical moments. He hit the game-winning shot with four seconds left in the Crimson’s battle with BU, and the rookie put up nine points in the final seven minutes of Harvard’s game against Dartmouth to spur a comeback victory.
Best Director: Kathy Delaney-Smith
Now in her 31st season at the helm of the women’s basketball team, Delany-Smith has orchestrated an effective offense in the absence of graduated senior Brogan Berry. The Crimson is off to a 10-5 start this season and just clinched its first conference win, topping Dartmouth in the Ivy opener.
Best Supporting Cast: Harvard football
Chapple’s performance would not have been so memorable without the added help of senior Trevor Scales, senior Kyle Juszczyk, and company. And as a bonus, football gets the nod for its continued support of the men’s and women’s basketball teams. Here’s to filling out the front bleachers at Lavietes every home game.
Best Performance (Drama): Harvard hockey’s 6-5 OT win against BU
The plot had all the good components of an unfolding drama: a sibling showdown, a crosstown rivalry, a cliffhanger after regulation. It was indeed dramatic, but in the end, the Crimson walked (or skated) away victorious. Down 5-2 going into the third period, Harvard mounted a comeback for the ages, tying it up in regulation and putting it away with less than a minute to go in overtime.
Best Performance (Comedy): The Columbia men’s football team
A 69-0 loss. A grand total of eight first downs. -19 rushing yards. Now that’s live comedy at its finest.
Best Original Screenplay: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQHTFTkpJew"">A Late Night Escape in Taipei

Like college finals, snowfall, and shopping frenzies, a Harvard-Dartmouth dogfight in Leede Arena has become an annual winter tradition.In each of the past few years, a heavily-favored Crimson squad has gone into Hanover and endured a surprisingly gritty effort from the Big Green—who sport an 18-84 record over the last four seasons—before eventually pulling away in the second half and winning by double digits.In the 2013 edition of the contest, Harvard found itself in such a situation once again. And on this occasion, time was quickly running out.Just 32 minutes into its conference season, the Crimson’s chances of three-peating as league champion were in jeopardy of taking a major dive, and a stagnant Harvard offense—trailing by three with 7:33 to go—needed to make something happen.So it turned to the man who has been doing just that all season long, and once again, Siyani Chambers saved the day.
Starting at the top of the key, the freshman crossed over his defender, Dartmouth’s Alex Mitola, and then blew past him. He drew a foul, poured in a layup, and capped the play with a passionate fist pump along the baseline that energized his team.Chambers’ ensuing free throw tied the game, and Harvard would never trail again, as the point guard sparked the Crimson to a 17-2 run down the stretch that gave it a 75-65 win.“Typical Ivy League basketball on the road,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “We really found the energy and the courage to step forward and make a lot of plays that we needed, and I think Siyani was in the middle of it, making things happen.”Chambers was at his best as the game wound down.In the contest’s final 2:30, the point guard got to the line and hit both free throws, assisted sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi on a dunk with a second remaining on the shot clock, and then hit an open jumper to ice the win.The freshman finished with six assists and a career-high 22 points, including 16 in the second half, and for his efforts earned his second-consecutive and fourth-overall Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor.“I was just really anxious to come out here and do what I could [to] help my teammates win in order to get our first victory in the Ivy League,” Chambers said.By achieving that goal in heroic fashion, the Cousy Award nominee was able to add another impressive item to a rapidly growing resume.Chambers leads the Ancient Eight with 6.0 assists per game, second-best in the country among rookies. He is also second in the conference in three-point shooting at 50 percent (including a perfect three-for-three on Saturday) and ranks seventh in both points (13.3) and steals (1.5) per game.But the importance of Chambers’ performance thus far goes far beyond the numbers that have largely surpassed everyone’s expectations.

It was only fitting that the showdown between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the country should come down to the wire. In the final points of the last match of the day, the top-ranked Harvard women’s squash team fell to Princeton, 5-4, in New Jersey.The result came down to the final grouping, as the two teams, which both entered the day undefeated, split the first six matches. Crimson sophomore Amanda Sobhy quickly defeated her opponent in the No. 1 position to win in straight sets, but the Tigers were by no means ready to lay down quietly.In the No. 4 spot, Rachel Leizman of Princeton outlasted Harvard freshman Michelle Gemmell. Although Gemmell found herself one point away from a Crimson victory, Leizman continued to battle and ended up winning the set and the match, 12-10, in the fifth.With each team having won four matches, the contest would be decided by the pairing in the No. 7 spot between co-captain Sarah Mumanachit of Harvard and Alex Sawin. The two players battled deep into a fourth set tiebreaker until Sawin finally converted on a match ball, allowing her to win the set, 16-14, while at the same time sealing the match and the Tigers’ victory.“The Princeton crowd was going nuts,” fellow co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “The energy in the gymnasium was unbelievable. This is what college squash is all about…. [Mumanachit] really never gave up. In the end it didn’t quite work out for us, but we were just so proud of her.”
The Tigers won two of the first three matches in the opening shift. At the No. 6 position, Kingshott made short work of her opponent and proceeded to win in three sets.Although sophomore Haley Mendez took home the first set, she could not keep up with her Princeton rival and went on to lose the next three.Sophomore Megan Murray, who competed in the No. 9 spot, also fell in a tight, five-set battle to Tara Harrington.But the Crimson bounced back in the next set of matches, digging itself out of a hole to knot the contest at three matches apiece.After pulling out a five-setter the day before against Penn, senior Laura Gemmell showed no signs of fatigue en route to a tough, four-game victory in the No. 2 position.Playing at No. 5 and holding her opponent to seven, two, and eight points in each game, freshman Saumya Karki rolled to a straight-set victory.But despite finding herself up two sets in the No. 8 spot, freshman Isabelle Dowling could not hang on against Tigers sophomore Hallie Dewey and fell in a five-set battle, losing the final game by just two points.“We all fought really hard, and I think this was a good learning experience, particularly for the freshmen,” Kingshott said. “For [Dowling]…she’ll hopefully learn from that experience, and in the next match, hopefully she’ll remember the situation she was in.”The final grouping was full of drama, and Princeton emerged with the victory by taking two of the final three matches.Sobhy continued her dominance of her competition, holding Julie Cerullo of the Tigers below four points in each game of the sophomore’s straight-set victory. Sobhy has never lost while playing for Harvard.

The last time that the Harvard men’s squash team won a match against Princeton, George W. Bush had just been inaugurated into his second term as President. But the year that Bush’s successor was inaugurated into his second term of office would not be the one to break the skid.It seemed like a repeat of 2011 as the Tigers (6-0, 2-0 Ivy) once again upset the Crimson’s previously unblemished record in heartbreaking fashion.Mere hours after the Harvard women fell to a similar fate, the reigning Ivy League and CSA National Champions eked out a win over the Crimson (8-1, 2-1 Ivy) at the Jadwin Squash Courts on Sunday, 5-4, the same score by which Princeton topped Harvard the year before.“They’re a team that shows up on the day consistently,” co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “You think that even when some of their players are people who you would beat on paper, they show up, and some of our guys didn’t have the most solid performances. Today was a really individual incident, where it really came down to the wire, and two points could have gone the other way, and we would have had the match.”Down 4-3, the Crimson sent its No. 2 player, junior Brandon McLaughlin, onto the court to face his counterpart on the Tigers, Samuel Kang. Kang easily won the first two games, 11-5 and 11-6, and looked to take the third game as well, but McLaughlin’s foe couldn’t convert on five match balls and dropped the third game, 12-14.
McLaughlin and Kang fought two more hotly contested games, with McLaughlin taking the fourth to tie the match before losing the final game, 11-9, to give Princeton its eighth consecutive victory over Harvard.“[McLaughlin] got down against [Kang], and he gritted his teeth and fought back—it’s how he operates,” Scherl said. “He’s always been a fighter, but unfortunately it got down to the last couple of points when he buckled down and fell to the guy.”While the drama unfolded on the No. 2 court, the Crimson’s top-ranked player and reigning CSA national champion, junior Ali Farag, took on a former national champion in the Tigers’ Todd Harrity. Harrity took the first game, 11-5, before Farag bounced back to win three consecutive and take the match, 3-1.“At first I didn’t play well because I was nervous from watching the number two, Brandon McLaughlin,” Farag said. “But after that, I talked to my coach, and he told me to just forget about the other match and get the job done, and I think from there, I played just fine.”With the win, Farag remains undefeated, both against Harrity, whom he topped, 3-2, in last year’s matchup, and in his collegiate career.“I thought [Ali] played unbelievable squash with a lot of pressure on him at the end,” Scherl said. “He’s always expected to win, but playing Todd Harrity who’s an incredible player, never easy to beat, I thought even after having gone down the first game, he composed himself well and got himself together and played beautiful squash to win that.”The Tigers jumped out to an early lead, taking the first two matches of the day. Freshman Matt Roberts went down in straight games at the No. 9 position, while No. 3 Gary Power took the first game before dropping the next three to his opponent.Harvard responded, as sixth-seeded junior Tommy Mullaney and eighth-seeded co-captain Jason Michas both bested their opponents in straight games to knot the score at two apiece.“I thought Tommy Mullaney and Jason Michas posted incredible showings today getting on and off court, really executing their game plans and taking it to their opponents,” Scherl said. “I saw Tommy just dominate his opponent. The kid never had a chance.”Losses at the fourth and fifth spots gave Princeton the lead back before Scherl defeated his opponent at No. 7 to bring it to 4-3. Farag noted that some of the Crimson’s struggles stemmed from the conditions of the court, which made it difficult for the visitors to find their rhythm.“I think the fact that they were playing at home made a huge difference,” Farag said. “Their courts were really bouncy and really hard, so a lot of our players struggled with that. It’s hard to finish the ball on these courts.”Despite the track record that the team holds against the Tigers, Scherl remains optimistic about the next meeting between the two.“Coming off the match, we’ll do what we always do,” Scherl said. “We’ll pick up the little things and keep working, and I think Princeton should be afraid the next time that they see us.”—Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samanthalin@college.harvard.edu.

Applied physics professor Federico Capasso remembers the emergence of fiber optics vividly—he was working at Bell Laboratories when the research institution performed the first industrial tests of the technology forty years ago. Fiber optics quickly gained prominence in the subsequent years as a more robust way of sending information with light instead of electrical signals.Today, Capasso and his colleagues are researching what could be the latest breakthrough in fiber optics technology: the vortex beam, a special type of light that twists as it travels. Capasso said he believes that the twists in a beam could potentially increase the information capacity of a single fiber many times over.In a paper published in Nature Communications in December, Capasso and his team describe a new device that can detect the “twistiness” of vortex beams. Although other devices capable of sensing the twist of a vortex beam exist, they are bulky and expensive, Capasso said.“We took a commercial device that cost around 20 dollars and simply modified it,” Capasso said. “It shows you can do things not only in a simpler way but also in a cheaper way.”Research into the use of vortex beams in fiber optics first began in 2004, when scientists began sending multiple vortex beams, each at the same wavelength, along a single optical fiber–a technique known as spatial division multiplexing.
“With vortex beams you can presumably increase the information capacity by another large factor and exceed the wall that many system engineers think is there around one hundred terabits per second [on a single fiber],” Capasso said.To fully realize the potential of spatial division multiplexing, a detector like Capasso’s must separate and read off the different types of vortex beams sent along the fiber. Each different type of beam has a special number called orbital angular momentum that characterizes its “twistiness” and can take on any integer value.Capasso’s device was able to distinguish between beams of three different orbital angular momentums, meaning that such a solution could, in principle, triple the capacity of current fiber optics systems. But Capasso estimated that a factor of ten improvement might be possible with spatial division multiplexing—and other scientists think it could be even higher.Capasso, however, emphasized that his group’s results are only preliminary, and must be complemented by research on the manufacture and transport of vortex beams.“There are a number of companies that are taking this approach seriously as a research topic,” Capasso said. “Nothing is going to be inside of a practical system in my opinion before probably ten years—although sometimes one makes mistakes in predicting technology.”—Staff writer Brian C. Zhang can be reached at brianzhang@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: January 15, 2013, at 12:55 a.m.Stephen Lassonde, deputy dean of the college at Brown University, has been named Harvard College’s new dean of student life. He will assume the position in late March.Katherine Bergeron, dean of the college at Brown, announced Lassonde’s departure in an email to Brown students on Monday. Bergeron praised Lassonde for his work to improve academic advising and reform the deliberative procedures of Brown’s Committee on Academic Standing.“His departure represents a huge loss for our community,” Bergeron wrote.Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds also praised Lassonde in an email to Harvard students later on Monday.
“Dean Lassonde brings a wealth of experience on all the issues the OSL oversees, including student services, academic standing, undergraduate advising, support for underrepresented student populations,” Hammonds wrote. “These will all be critical areas for the College in the coming years.”As the new dean of student life, Lassonde will head the College’s Office of Student Life, which has seen the turnover of several administrators in the past year.The permanent dean of student life position has been vacant since Suzy M. Nelson departed in June to become vice president and dean of the college at Colgate University. When <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/20/suzy-nelson-leaves-college/"">Nelson’s departure was announced in March, Joshua G. McIntosh was named interim dean of student life, but in June he too <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/6/4/mcintosh-leaves-johns-hopkins/"">announced that he would leave for another position at Johns Hopkins University.Lassonde, who is also an adjunct assistant history professor, spent nearly six years at Brown. He received his Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale University, and also has served as an assistant dean at Yale College.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.—Staff Writer Elizabeth S.

Following ancient Vietnamese culture, I spent my New Years at the zoo in Ho Chi Min City listening to top 40 songs. The zoo was full of people; it was impossible to get around without bumping into someone and immediately checking to see if your passport was still intact.  There weren’t too many animals—only a dozen if you counted the giraffe statue and the sign for the monkeys, 20 if you counted the American tourists, which the locals do. At one point, a women turned away from the elephants just to stare at me. Try as I might to blend in, I must have looked out of place with my red number 25 tour sticker and tendency to speak loudly in English. She gave me a big toothy grin and a thumbs up and then snapped a photo. A part of me was waiting for her to toss me a peanut from the way she was watching me. I guess there was a sign that said not to feed the animals. 
 Most people weren’t paying attention to the animals anyways. Something bigger had attracted their attention. And to my surprise, it was not my mother's fannie-pack.  Thousands of young couples and their kids surrounded a huge stage in the center of the park. At first I thought they were looking at the adjacent sign pointing to the monkeys, but then Santa appeared. He was a tiny Santa, and the thinnest I have ever seen. He had the beard and red jacket, but the jolly belly full of Christmas cookies was non-existent. I guess there was another sign that said not to feed the Santa.  A group of young girls stood next to Santa on the stage. They also looked in need of a cookie or roast beast or a health care plan or something. They appeared about 15 or 16, which seemed a bit young to be working in the North Pole if you ask me. I wanted to talk to them about unionizing but suddenly the music started.  It was a familiar tune—a bit shocking given that I didn’t know the Vietnamese national anthem, which I assumed they would play on New Years. But then Santa started waving his fist in the air and the little girls began trotting like horseback riders and my dad started singing along: “Heyyy Sexy Lady.”  It was a tune as sweet as the “Star Spangled Banner,” or “Thrift Shop.” It was nothing other than “Gangnam Style.” I suddenly felt at home in this Vietnamese zoo filled with Korean music, malnourished Santas, and one elephant.

Within  a small Massachusetts fishing village, three reunited friends struggle  to find happiness in Tom O’Brien’s new film “Fairhaven.” “Fairhaven” features O’Brien, who also wrote the film with co-star  Chris Messina, as Jon, a former high school football star who, like his  hero Tom Brady did in a real “60 Minutes” interview, questions whether  he really can have it all in life. Jon openly grapples with the  uneasiness this brings him and seeks understanding from others, from a  meditation coach to a therapist. He is not alone in his search—Dave  (Messina) feels similarly distraught and hides behind a façade of a  carefree life. However, having to return to Fairhaven for his father’s  funeral forces Dave to realize that he cannot run away from his  problems. Meanwhile, responsible, single father Sam (Rich Sommer) tries  to move on from his ex-wife Kate (Sarah Paulson). As he takes back the  part of himself he had lost in his love for Kate, Sam begins to find  happiness again in who he is.  Sommer,  best known for his portrayal of Harry Crane on “Mad Men,” shared in an  interview how the film’s cast worked together to bring the screenplay to  life as a sincere, relatable story.  
The  Harvard Crimson: You’ve had a diverse array of roles in your acting  experience, most notably a part on “Mad Men.” How does playing Sam  compare? Rich  Sommer: It's frankly my favorite performance of mine. We were able to  do with it what we wanted, and I was able to get out of Sam what I  haven't been able to do with other characters. I portrayed him how I  wanted to portray him. THC: What was it like working with the other cast members of “Fairhaven”? RS:  We were kind of isolated in this very small town in the middle of  winter. We luckily all hit it off so quickly; for a movie like this,  it's imperative. I feel this is an intimate movie, and you can only get  there if you are willing to be open with each other and trust each  other.  THC:  Jon seems to remain stuck on Tom Brady’s question of whether there is  more to life.  What central questions does “Fairhaven” explore?

Days after internet activist Aaron Swartz's Jan. 11 suicide, The Huffington Post <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/aaron-swartz-stephen-heymann_n_2473278.html?utm_hp_ref=tw"">reports that during the 1990s, Swartz's prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann—who was, even then, a pioneer in policing the internet—tried to get Harvard's cooperation in monitoring the University's network usage without a court order. Heymann proposed that the University put an ""electronic banner on its intranet telling users they were being monitored"" and implying their consent. Harvard refused, HuffPo reports, citing ""the privacy of its users.""<!--more-->Here's more from a 1996 issue of <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=2xcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=harvard&amp;f=false"">Network World:""Harvard University was recently the undercover site for the Department of Justice's network surveillance of Julio Cesar Ardita, an Argentinian charged with breaking into the Navy's computers via the Internet. […]But Harvard balked at [Heymann's] request [to put in place the electric banner]. 'We don't monitor the network, and we respect the privacy of our users,' said Franklin Steen, the Harvard network director. So the Justice Department got a 30-day court order, with extensions, and did the data tap to catch Ardita. The court order came with a gag rule to keep anyone from talking about it, which could tip off the suspect.""This revelation comes as MIT begins an <a href=""http://techblogs.mit.edu/news/2013/01/mit-responds-to-aaron-swartzs-death/"">internal inquiry into its role in Aaron Swartz's suicide. Swartz, who served as a fellow at Harvard's Safra Center for Ethics during the 2010-2011 academic year, faced decades in prison for allegedly downloading millions of academic articles from JSTOR via MIT's network, with the intent to distribute them. Though JSTOR encouraged Heymann to drop charges, MIT did not.

A Massachusetts court has dismissed the wrongful death suit filed against Harvard and three of its employees by the mother of Justin D. C. D. Cosby.Cosby, a Cambridge resident, was fatally shot in 2009 in the basement of Kirkland House during a drug deal gone wrong. His mother B. Denise Cosby filed a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/26/cosby-mother-sues-harvard/"">wrongful death suit in May against the University, Lowell Co-House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck, and chemistry and chemical biology lecturer Ryan M. Spoering, who was resident dean of Lowell at the time of the shooting.The lawsuit alleged that Harvard had acted negligently by allowing the man who eventually would be <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/4/22/murder-copney-firstdegree-jury-murder-guilty-harvard-shooting/"">convicted of Justin Cosby’s murder to live in Lowell House for months, in violation of University rules. Harvard’s lawyers <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/26/motion-dismiss-cosby-murder/"">had argued that the University had no duty to protect Cosby.In a ruling obtained by the Boston Globe, Middlesex Superior Court Judge Mitchell Kaplan sided with Harvard, dismissing the lawsuit against the University and its three employees.“There is nothing inherent in knowingly or negligently allowing a Harvard student to permit her boyfriend to stay in her room such that a reasonable person would expect visitors to the University would be protected from the foreseeable deadly conduct of the room guest,” wrote Kaplan in the nine-page opinion.
Denise Cosby’s original complaint centered around a Harvard rule that requires students to speak with their House Master before hosting a non-Harvard guest for more than two nights.Jabrai Jordan Copney, the man convicted of shooting Justin Cosby, resided on campus for months in the Lowell House dorm room of his girlfriend in violation of Harvard rules. The Harvard College Handbook for Students, which was cited in the complaint, states that “The hosts of repeated overnight guests who are not Harvard students must make their guests’ presence known to the Building Manager and security personnel due to safety considerations.”The complaint alleged that Harvard was at fault because the three Lowell House officials either “knowingly allowed Copney, a nonstudent, to live in the Lowell House for an extended period of time, in contravention of Harvard’s rules, and allowed him to have unfettered access to the House and the rest of Harvard’s campus,” or “negligently failed to detect Copney’s continuing, unauthorized presence.”Harvard in September submitted a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/26/motion-dismiss-cosby-murder/"">legal filing saying the University could not be blamed for Cosby’s death. Harvard’s lead attorney Martin F. Murphy stressed that point when the two sides traded arguments in court during a hearing on Dec. 19.“Particularly [when] the plaintiff has come onto the property in order to engage in dangerous activities, the law makes it clear that [Harvard] doesn’t have that duty of safety to [Cosby],” said Murphy in December.During that same hearing, attorneys representing Cosby’s mother argued that the University had allowed a dangerous situation to develop by not enforcing its own policies regarding guests in Harvard dorms.“The only reason this became a situation is because of [Harvard’s] negligence,” said Isaac H. Peres, the plaintiff’s lead attorney, at the time.According to testimony from Copney’s murder trial, he and two other men cornered Justin Cosby in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway on May 18, 2009. Cosby sold marijuana to Harvard students and the group demanded that he hand over the drugs he had with him. When Cosby refused, Copney shot him, prosecutors and witnesses said.In April 2011 Copney was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Cosby. His two companions testified against Copney in exchange for lighter sentences and both pleaded guilty to manslaughter.—Staff Writer Matthew Q. Clarida can be reached at clarida@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: January 16, 2012, at 8:54 p.m.French actress Marion Cotillard has been named the recipient of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2013 Woman of the Year award.Cotillard received critical acclaim for starring as Édith Piaf in “La Vie en Rose,” a role that earned her an Academy Award for best actress and made her the first person to win an Oscar for a French language performance in 2007. She also garnered rave reviews for her 2010 performance as Mallorie Cobb in “Inception” alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.Renee E. Rober ’13, president of the Pudding, lauded Cotillard's qualifications after the selection was announced on Wednesday.“We all have a French exam that we're a little nervous about, so we thought we'd pick somebody who can tutor us,” Rober joked. “But in all seriousness, she is wildly talented—she can sing, act, dance, speak both English and French.… Nobody is more excited about that than I am.”
Tyler B. Faux ’13, the Pudding's publicity manager, also expressed enthusiasm for the pick in an emailed statement.“As an internationally accomplished actress and singer with a brilliant career heralded by critics and mainstream audiences alike, Marion Cotillard has entranced the Pudding with her multitude of talents and an unbridled commitment to her art,” Faux wrote.In the annual Woman of the Year celebration to be held on Jan. 31, Cotillard will be honored with a parade through Cambridge, after which she will be roasted by the Pudding and presented with a traditional Pudding Pot. Tickets for the event can be purchased on the Pudding's website.With Wednesday's announcement, Cotillard joins the elite company of past honorees—including <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/27/HastyPudding-Parade-ClareDanes/"">Claire Danes, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/1/29/hathaway-pudding-actress-harvard/"">Anne Hathaway, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/2/8/pudding-parade-honors-theron-superheroes-jugglers/"">Charlize Theron, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/2/14/a-pretty-woman-of-the-year/"">Julia Roberts, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1992/2/12/jodie-foster-takes-home-pudding-pot/"">Jodie Foster, and <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1961/2/20/jane-fonda-visits-hasty-pudding-ceremony/"">Jane Fonda—who have won the award since it was established in 1951.The Pudding’s 2013 Man of the Year award will be announced next week, to be followed by an event honoring the male awardee on Feb. 8.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.Twitter and Facebook posts circulating this article have been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Jan. 16Due to an editing error, earlier versions of posts circulating this article on Twitter and Facebook incorrectly referred to the organization honoring Cotillard as the Hasting Pudding.

While most Harvard students will be spending the week before Jan. 28 relaxing before classes begin or wrapping up a J-term project, Emily Hannah will be 3900 miles away from Cambridge, accomplishing a much different goal.
Along with five others women, the freshman Nordic skier was named to the 2013 FIS Junior World Championship team based on results from the past week’s US Cross Country Ski Championships in Soldier Hollow, Utah.
Hannah skied to a second-place finish in the 5-km skate race at the national championships to secure her spot on the Junior World Championship team, a first for any Crimson cross-country skier.
But the honor isn’t completely novel for the Colorado native, who also made the team in 2012 as a J1 (ages 16-17) athlete. At the 2012 Junior Worlds, held in Erzurum, Turkey, Hannah placed 51st in the women’s skiathlon event.
This year, the freshman will again head off to take on the best 18 and 19-year-old skiers in the world—this time in Liberec, Czech Republic, where the 2013 FIS Nordic Junior and U23 World Championships will be held from Jan. 20 to Jan. 27. Over a thousand semi-professional and collegiate Nordic skiers will convene to compete for both individual and team honors.
“Most Harvard students realize how many adjustments you make as a freshman, just going from high school to college, but then as an athlete, you’re also making adjustments to a new coach, a new training plan, new teammates, and that’s a big adjustment, so it’s not unusual in those circumstances to have an athlete take a year just to get used to skiing at the college level,” Nordic coach Chris City said. “I think it says so many things about Emily’s focus and determination to be able to manage all of those things and still be able to ski at this level. I’m excited to see what she can do on her second trip to World Juniors with a little more familiarity with the racing environment expectations.”

With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. First up, the Brown Bears.<a name=""jump"">
Football:
Although finishing third in the league in 2012, the Brown football team enjoyed an eerily similar season to 2011, where they finished second. In both years, the team notched seven victories while outscoring opponents by almost exactly 50 points (50 in ’11, 51 in ’12). Led by quarterback Patrick Donnelly’s 226 yards per game and 15 touchdowns, the Bears won four of five after starting the season with conference losses against Harvard and Princeton. The lone exception was a 20-17 road loss to Penn where Brown took a 17-14 lead on a Cody Taulbee 1-yard touchdown plunge with three minutes to go, only to see Penn twice drive down the field for game-tying and game-winning field goals. Donnelly will graduate this year as the Bears look to take a three-game season ending winning streak as momentum into 2013.
Men’s Water Polo:
 The 14th-ranked Brown water polo team finished second and fifth in its two most important tournaments of the year, losing to St. Francis in the finals of the CWPA Northern Championships and defeating No. 17 Navy to take fifth in the CWPA Eastern Championships. Senior Svetozar Stefanovic was named CWPA Northern Division Player of the year for the fourth consecutive season and joined teammates James McNamara and Henry Fox on the CWPA First Team All-North. The team won 29 of its 33 matches, beginning the season with seven straight victories to win the Brown Labor Day Weekend Tournament, one of two tournament victories (along with the Ivy League Championships) it took home on the year.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
 For the fourth consecutive year, Brown could not escape the basement of the Ancient Eight. The Bears have alternated between seventh and eighth during that time, finishing a game ahead of their 2011-2012 squad this year. After winning two of three to start the season at the Central Connecticut and CCSU Invitationals, the Bears stumbled in losing five of their next six, capturing only three of a possible eighteen total sets over that time frame. Freshman Maddie Lord provided a bright spot for the squad, finishing eighth in the conference in kills.
 
Men’s Golf: 
 After a last place finish at the Ivy League Golf championships last fall, the Brown golf team was honored in the offseason with a GCAA Team Academic Award, posting the second highest cumulative grade point average in Division I. After an early fifth place finish in the Navy Invitational, the team posted three consecutive top-15 finishes before ending the season with a season-best effort in the Ivy League match play tournament. Sophomore Justin Miller won two of three matches on the weekend to help the Bears defeat both Harvard and Princeton en route to a third place finish.
 
Women’s Golf:
The Brown golf team had a busy 2011, competing in nine tournaments and playing 23 rounds of golf—both of which tied for or led the Ancient Eight. The Bears posted an average score of 314.26 strokes per round, edging out Columbia and Penn for second best in the conference. Low scorer sophomore Stephanie Hsieh finished the semester fifth in the conference last year, posting an average score of just 4.7 strokes above par but has improved even as she fell to eighth in the conference. Hsieh cut her strokes per round by nearly one whole stroke but the rest of the team has struggled to replace 2011 top-25 seniors Megan Touhy, Heath Arison, and Carly Arison. Hsieh is the only Bear in the top 25, although freshmen Juliette Garay and Lauren Flynn both rank in the top 35.
 
Women’s Soccer:
After a season in which they outscored their opponents by ten goals and finished with 10 wins and a fourth-place finish in the Ancient Eight, the Brown women’s soccer team regressed in 2012. The Bears won only one game and notched only seven wins against six losses. Brown benefited from strong net play, with goalie Amber Bledsoe leading the league in save percentage and backup MC Barrett finished fifth. Splitting time in the goal, the two gave up a combined 18 goals. On the offensive side of the ball, Chloe Cross led the conference with 69 shots and led the team with five goals.
 
Men’s Soccer:
 After finishing first in the Ivy League a season before, the Brown soccer team finished third in the Ancient Eight in 2012 but ended the season ranked No. 15 in the nation. The team lost only one game in conference play but lost its final game of the season in overtime to Dartmouth in a loss that cost it the Ivy crown. The team defeated Drexel in the first round of the NCAA championship before falling in the second to two seed Maryland. Three members of the team (seniors Sam Kernan-Schloss, Dylan Remick, and Ryan McDuff) were named to Academic All-Ivy squads and Remick was named an All-American by the NCAA and invited to the 2013 MLS Player Combine. Remick led the team with seven assists and tossed in two goals as well.
 
Field Hockey:
A year after the winless 2011 squad finished last in the Ivy League, the Brown field hockey team scored its first conference win since the 2010 team won three straight to end the year. The team won four of its last ten games after a 2-5 start to the season, and sophomore Meghan O’Donnell finished sixth in the conference in goals. O’Donnell had three game-winning goals for the Bears and scored four goals in Brown’s three game winning streak in late October. Fellow sophomores Clayton Christus and Shannon McSweeney, along with O’Donnell and freshman Alexis Miller, were given 2012 All-Ivy honors.

With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next up, the Columbia Lions.<a name=""jump"">
Football:
After finishing last in the Ivy League in 2011, and being outscored by 117 points along the way, before notching its only victory of the season in a double-overtime last week thriller against second-place Brown, the Columbia football team had nowhere to go but up in 2012. Although the team scored fewer points than a season before, an improved defense managed to give up 56 fewer points as well. Take out the 69-0 drubbing by Harvard and Columbia gave up only 22.6 points per game in its other contests. The Lions lost close decisions to Penn and Dartmouth, even leading the eventual champion Quakers by ten points with ten minutes to go before consecutive touchdown drives by Billy Ragone ended their upset bid. The Lions finished with three wins on the season, including a 17-point victory over the Cornell Big Red and pro prospect quarterback Jeff Matthews.
 
Volleyball:
 Along with Yale and Princeton, Columbia continued its excellence in volleyball at the top of the Ancient Eight. The Lions tied with the Tigers for second and have finished no lower than third in the past four years. Although Columbia struggled in early season losses to Yale and Princeton in which it won a combined one set, the team won five in a row to end the season and defeated the Tigers 3-1 in the season finale. Senior outside hitter Megan Gaughn won her third consecutive All-Ivy League honors and second-straight first-team nod, having double digit kills in 17 matches and finishing second in the conference in kills per set.
 
Women’s Golf:
 A year after finishing third in the Ivy League with an average score of 27 strokes over par, the Columbia women’s golf team ranks fourth in the conference at the turn of the new calendar year. Sophomore Michelle Piyapattra, the best golfer in the Ivy League last year with two tournament rounds and an average score of just three strokes over par, has taken a step back in her junior season. Piyapattra, now the 14th ranked golfer in the Ivy League according to Golfstat, has played the most rounds—along with her teammates—of any Ancient Eight player but has seen her score against par rise by nearly two whole strokes. A low round of 65 represents the best effort of the year by an Ivy League player, but Piyapattra has been inconsistent in losing her spot atop the rankings. Six Columbia golfers rank in the top 30, but none in the top 10.
 
Men’s Golf: 
 Like the women, the Columbia men’s golf team has slipped a year after finishing third in the Ivy League. The Lions are currently sixth in the conference but have played more rounds than any other team but Penn. Top-heavy Columbia has two golfers in the top 11 of the Ivy League but nobody else in the top 25. Freshman Harrison Shih has played each tournament for Columbia and his low score of 65 is the best recorded this year by an Ivy League golfer. Junior Jordan Lee has played only two tournaments due to injury, but averages just three strokes above par and is tied for sixth in the league.
 
Women’s Soccer:
A model of consistency, the Columbia women’s soccer team finished fifth in the Ivy League for the third straight year. After winning three of their first six games, the Lions won only three of their next ten. Beverly Leon led the team with six goals and three assists and 33 shots on goals, with a 54.5% shots on goal percentage that led the squad. The team lost only one decision by more than one goal, but finished 2-8 in one-goal matches. In each win, the team shut out its opponent and goalie Grace Redmon finished second in the conference with 74 saves.
 
Men’s Soccer:
 The Columbia men’s soccer team finished the season with two wins in eight Ivy League matches and struggled in overtime games to put away opponents. All four overtime contests the Lions contested ended in ties, making the difference between a 2011 where the team finished third in the Ivy League and a 2012 where three losses by one goal doomed the team during conference play. The month of October, where the team went 1-1-3 and scored only four goals, was particularly rough.
 
Field Hockey:
A year after tying for third, the Columbia field hockey team secured an outright third place Ancient Eight finish in 2012. After losing its first two games, the team caught fire in winning seven of their last nine, with losses against Albany (N.Y.) and Princeton breaking up a series of Lion victories. Sisters Bridget and Katie DeSandis combined for 19 assists, finishing fourth and fifth, respectively, in the Ivy League. Goalie Christie O’Hara finished with 120 goals and a save percentage of .755.

With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major fall sport. Next up, the Cornell Big Red.<a name=""jump"">
Football:
 Before the season began, Cornell was picked to finish third in the Ivy League and was even given two first-place votes. The season began well, with victories in two of the team’s first three games (including a 39 point drubbing of Yale). However, the week after Cornell lost by 32 in Cambridge and would only win two games the remainder of the season, one a 37-35 thriller over Princeton in which NFL prospect Jeff Mathews threw for 525 yards and four touchdowns against a porous Tigers secondary. Mathews accounted for 3,196 yards through the air and 18 touchdowns, both tops in the conference as receivers Luke Tasker, Gren Gellatly, and Kurt Ondash finished one-two-three in the conference in receiving yards. Cornell’s defense—which gave up 452 yards a game, proved to be the team’s downfall as the team lost three games in which it put up at least 27 points.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
The Cornell volleyball team improved by two victories and one place in the Ancient Eight standings in 2012, winning five of its last ten games to climb to sixth place in the Ivy League. The squad started by dropping three of its first four league decisions but rebounded and won nine of its final 14 sets, including a 3-1 victory over the second-place Princeton Tigers. Cornell had not beaten Princeton in six years. Outside Hitter Kelly Marble starred for the big red, playing the most matches and sets of any player in the conference and leading the conference in service aces and finishing second in kills.
 
Men’s Golf:
After finishing seventh in 2011, the 2012 Cornell golf team has slipped to last in the Ancient Eight standings after its first three tournaments. The team’s scores are virtually identical to those from last year, and after sporting no golfers in the top 25 in the past season, junior Carl Schimenti ranks 19th in the Ivy League in 2012.  
 
Women’s Soccer:
 A difficult campaign for the Cornell women’s soccer team ended without an Ivy League win and only one win in sixteen contests. The team gave up 42 goals in 16 matches but only 14 in seven conference contests. First-year coach Patrick Farmer and the team struggled to close out the season after a promising four game stretch in October where, despite outscoring opponents 5-4, the team managed only a 1-2-1 record. In the final two games of the season, the team gave up eight goals, scoring only one in defeats to Princeton and Dartmouth. Sophomore midfielder Claire MacManus and senior forward Maneesha Chitanvis were named to the All-Ivy League Second team after the season, a bright spot in a winless Ivy campaign.
 
Men’s Soccer:
Just two years after finishing last in the Ivy League, the Cornell men’s soccer team completed the turnaround in finishing 15-2 on the season and 6-1 in the league, capturing its first Ancient Eight title since 1995. Over the past two years, the Big Red flipped a -3 goal differential into a +26 one and made the NCAA Championships before 1-0 to Syracuse in the first round. The Big Red exploded out of the gate with 12 straight wins. After the season, junior Daniel Haber was named a First-Team All-American and signed a professional soccer contract with Israel’s Maccabi Haifa, forgoing his senior year of eligibility and starting an immediate leave of absence.
 
Field Hockey:
After dropping six of its first seven decisions to begin the season, the Cornell field hockey team won six matches in a row in the highlight of a 2012 campaign that saw it finish fourth in the Ancient Eight. Three one-goal losses left the Big Red behind Dartmouth and Columbia. Forward Hannah Balleza ranked third in the Ivy League with 35 points, while goalie Carolyn Horner ranked second in the Ancient Eight with 1.88 goals-against average.
