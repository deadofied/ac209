With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next Up, the Dartmouth Big Green.<a name=""jump"">
Football:
 Picked to finish sixth in the preseason, the Dartmouth football team tied Brown and Princeton for third in the league and outscored its opponents by 41 points per game. The Big Green won six games and lost close decisions to Penn (28-21) and Brown (28-24) that could have taken it higher up in the standings. The Big Green was a perplexing 1-4 at home—the product of taking on the class of the conference (Brown, Harvard and Penn) in Hanover—but an unblemished 5-0 on the road. For the season, running back Dominick Pierre was the team’s best offensive player, posting nine touchdowns and 92 rushing yards per game.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
 A 2-22 season for the Big Green volleyball team ended in sour fashion, as the team dropped fourteen straight decisions to end the year. The team defeated Harvard in a hard-fought five set victory in its first Ivy League decision before dropping the rest of its Ancient Eight contests, winning only five sets the remainder of the year and none in its last six matches. Junior Elisa Scudder represented a bright spot on the squad, taking home Academic All-Ivy honors in addition to ranking 10th in the conference in hitting percentage (.283) and blocks per set (0.74) during conference play.
 
Men’s Golf:
 After finishing first last year in the Ancient Eight, Dartmouth’s men golf team has struggled to begin the season. Currently fifth in the Ivy League after its third tournament, Dartmouth has an average score seven strokes higher in 2012 than last season and has not yet notched a win after three in nine tournaments last season. However, two Dartmouth golfers rank in the top 10 and sophomore Charlie Edler has improved fourteen places and ranks fifth in the Ivy League.
 
Women’s Golf: 
 Although the team has fallen one spot in the Ivy League rankings, Dartmouth’s golf team has seen marked improvement this season. The team’s average score has fallen nearly eight strokes while its score versus par has decreased by five strokes. The team graduated top-30 Ivy League golfer Marietta Smith in 2012 but returned seventh-ranked Abram Lee, whose rank has dropped—much like the team’s as a whole—despite improving by one stroke to par and two strokes overall.
 
Women’s Soccer:
 Dartmouth had a historic season in 2012, winning 13 games to mark the most victories the team has had since the turn of the century. The team lost just one Ivy League game and ended the season with seven straight victories, culminating with a 3-0 victory in Ithaca for the team’s final game of the season. Freshman Corey Delaney took home conference Rookie of the Year honors (the team’s first outright winner since 1983) and five Big Green were named to the All-Iv first team (along with Daleny, Aurelia Solomon, Chrissy Lozier, Emma Brush, and Tatiana Saunders made the team)
 
Men’s Soccer:
The Big Green men’s soccer team excelled at home in 2012, finishing 6-1 overall and an undefeated 4-0 against Ivy League foes. The team had two members named to the All-Ivy team. Sophomore forward Alex Adelabu tallied a team-best nine goals, finishing second in the Ivy League in goals per game (0.56), points per game (1.31), and goals. In addition to making the All-Ivy first team, Adelabu ranked 41st in the country in total goals.
 
Field Hockey:
 Continuing its three-year improvement, Dartmouth finished second in the Ivy League in field hockey, scoring six wins in the league for the first time in four years. The Big Green won eleven games, including eight of its last ten. Dartmouth was the only team to score on Princeton—which outscored its opponents 45-1 over the course of the Ivy League system—and lost only one game at home all season. Goalkeeper Jenna Stearns allowed only 21 goals all season, second best in the conference and forward Ali Savage’s 26 points were fifth in the Ivy League.

With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next up, the University of Pennsylvania Quakers.<a name=""jump"">
Football:
 Much like Princeton, Penn football had a poor start to the year with two consecutive non-conference losses before notching its first win in Hanover at the end of September. The team, which used a victory against Dartmouth to jumpstart a four game winning streak in 2011, lost two of the next three games (including a defeat against league cellar dweller Yale) before rattling off four wins to end the season, none by more than nine points. That included wins over Princeton (leading the league at the time) and Harvard (reigning league champion) in back-to-back weeks that put Penn atop the Ivy League for the third time in four seasons.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
 Two years after back-to-back titles, the Penn volleyball team slid to fourth in the Ancient Eight standings. After winning six of seven in late October, the team won only six of 16 contested sets in November, losing three of its last four—including two losses to teams ranked above them in the standings that dropped it from second to fourth to close the season. In a bright spot, Dani Sheperd and Emma White finished one-two in the conference in digs, combining for 1,028 on the year.
 
Men’s Golf:
 Through four tournaments, the Penn men’s golf team has struggled to maintain its performance of a year ago. The team as a whole is scoring five shots worse versus par despite having five golfers in the top 25. The loss of departed top-10 golfer Scott Williams, the second best golfer on the Quakers a year ago, has created a void that hasn’t yet been filled. Junior Max Marisco ranks third in the conference and has posted better scores than a year ago but the rest of the team hasn’t yet caught up.
 
Women’s Golf: 
 The only team in the Ivy League which has seen its average round score go up between last season and this season, the Penn women’s golf team has struggled to replace 12th-ranked Tiffany Cheung. Cheung was the second best Quaker golfer last year and while sophomore Amanda Chin has improved by three strokes a round, the team hasn’t been as consistent as a year ago, when they finished fourth in the Ancient Eight.
 
Women’s Soccer:
 For the fourth time in six seasons, the Penn Quakers entered the final weekend of the women’s soccer season with a chance to win the league outright with a victory. However, the team fell, 4-2, to the Princeton Tigers to drop them down to third in the final standings as the Tigers finished off an unblemished 7-0 perfect season. Three Penn players—seniors Erin Beck and Alex Daynecka as well as junior Kerry Scalora—were named first-team All-Ivy standards and the team earned the National Soccer Coaches Association of America team Academic Award for the 12th time in 13 seasons (award is given to teams with an average GPA above 3.0).
 
Men’s Soccer:
 After struggling for most of the year, in the season finale the Penn men’s soccer team defeated Harvard, 3-1, to climb out of the Ivy League cellar in its first Ancient Eight win of the season. Four members of the team took home All-Ivy honors with Travis Cantrell and Duke Lacroix notching second-team distinction Johny Dolezal and Stephen Baker garnering honorable mentions. After losing six straight to start the season, the team won both games it played at the Princeton Invitational en route to victories in three of its final ten games.
Field Hockey:
Penn continued its climb out of the Ivy League basement, improving its conference standing for the second straight year after finishing last in the conference in 2010. The Quakers finished fourth in the Ancient Eight and above .500 overall, winning three of four before a season-ending 7-0 loss to the Princeton Tigers. Sarah Hanson ranked tenth in the league in points but defensive struggles betrayed a Penn squad that gave up 51 goals, highest in the league.

With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next up, the Princeton Tigers.<a name=""jump"">
Football:
 Picked before the season to finish last in the Ivy League, the Princeton Tigers shocked the Ancient Eight with four consecutive victories in October after losing their first two games. The final game of that winning streak, a 39-34 triumph over the Harvard Crimson where the Tigers trailed by 24 in the final quarter, was the best of the Ivy League season. The Tigers squandered a golden opportunity to take the crown with consecutive narrow losses to Cornell (37-35) and Penn (28-21) in the following weeks but the season must be considered a success for a team that finished tied for last in the league in 2011—with a point differential of -109 that was 31 points worse than fellow laughing stock Columbia. Quarterback Connor Michelsen was the offensive leader for the Tigers, passing for 1,634 yards on the season.
 
Water Polo: 
 The Princeton men’s water polo team ended its season ranked 20th in the nation and defeated rival Brown at the team’s biggest competition, the CWPA Eastern championships. Men’s water polo coach Luis Nicolao was voted the CWPA Sportsman of the Year and sophomore Drew Hoffenberg and senior Tim Wenzlau were named to CWPA All-Southern teams, Hoffenberg making the first team and Wenzlau receiving second team honors. Wenzalu had an all-around good season, tallying up 37 goals, 24 assists, 32 steals, and 6 blocks.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
Despite losing three straight games to end the season, the Princeton volleyball team finished tied for second in the league, winning 11 more sets than it lost. Late losses to the league’s other top squads—Yale, Cornell, and Columbia—cost a squad a chance to win the league entering November. Outside hitter Lydia Rudnick had a terrific year, however, leading the league in kills with 370, 77 more than the closest competitor. Rudnick and Kendall Peterkin earned First-Team All-Ivy nods. Rudnick was a unanimous choice for the third year in a row while Peterkin was one of just two freshman named to the team.
 
Men’s Golf:
Through three tournaments, the Princeton men’s golf team is outperforming last year’s team, in no small part due to the efforts of freshman Quinn Pchal. Prchal is tied for sixth in the Ivy League, averaging three strokes above par per round and only 73.75 overall. He is part of a top-heavy Tiger squad with four members in the top 16 of the Ancient Eight but no other player in the top 40. With Bernie D’Amato (7th last year, currently 13th) not playing up to recent form and missing departed 2012 graduate Evan Harmeling (12th last year), the rest of the team has stepped up to compensate for their departures.
Women’s Golf:
 After a season in which it finished last in the Ivy League without winning a tournament, the Princeton women’s golf team has completely flipped the script in 2012. The team ranks second in the Ancient Eight behind the Harvard Crimson—who have four of the top five golfers in the Ivy League—and has improved by nearly 22 shots a game from a year ago. Kelly Shon—the Tigers’ only top-15 golfer from a year ago—ranks third in the conference by more than two shots versus par and is on pace to surpass her two tournament wins of a season ago with one in her first three events. Freshmen Anna Jang and Sydney Kersten rank in the top 20 golfers and the team already has a win after going two years between victories.
 
Women’s Soccer:
 Princeton soccer completed a historic season in 2012, with five players named to the All-Ivy first team for the first time since 1981. The eight total nominees surpassed the program record set in 2000 and senior Jen Hoy was named the Ivy League Player of the Year. Princeton did not lose a contest in the Ivy League, finishing with an unblemished 7-0 record. Hoy led the team in goals with 17, the second most in Princeton history and the most in the Ivy League since 2004. Hoy finished first in the conference in scoring and points and was third in the country in goals per game.
 
Men’s Soccer:
 A year after finishing seventh in the Ivy League—beating out only Harvard—the Princeton men’s soccer team finished fourth in 2012. The team lost only one game in conference play, a narrow 1-0 decision in Ithaca, and won four straight after losing three in a row at the beginning of the season. In postseason honors, freshman Thomas Sanner was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Year while senior defender Mark Linnville was named first-team All-Ivy for the fourth straight year.
 
Field Hockey:
In a season where the team won 21 of its 22 contests, outscoring opponents in conference by a 45-1 goal margin, and took home the national championship to boot, the Princeton field hockey team can be said to have had unqualified success in 2012. The team—whose loss on the last game of the regular season cost it an outright Ivy League title in 2011—won fourteen games in a row after its only loss of the season, a 2-0 September 23rd defeat at the hands of Syracuse. The team had five of the top ten goalscorers in the Ivy League, with forward Kathleen Sharkley leading the league in goals, points, and shots while Christina Malda led the league in goals against, saving 75% of the shots against her.

With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Last, and almost definitely least, the Yale Bulldogs.
Football:
 After a tumultuous offseason, the Yale football team entered 2012 with a new coach and were picked to finish fifth in the Ivy League. The Bulldogs played their best against the class of the Ancient Eight, defeating the Quakers at home by two touchdowns (the only Ivy League team to defeat Penn in 2012) and putting themselves in a position to win The Game late in the fourth quarter before Crimson running back Treavor Scales scampered for a game-sealing touchdown run late. Running back Tyler Varga, who accounted for 117 yards per game and eight touchdowns on the ground—including a 220 yard, three touchdown effort in a 26-22 loss to Columbia—was named to the FCS All-America squad in December and was the team’s best player. However, while the Bulldogs played up to the level of their higher-quality opponents they also were susceptible to duds against the lower rungs of the Ancient Eight, losing by 39 points to Cornell and by 4 to Columbia, who combined for two wins against non-Yale Ivy League squads.
Women’s Volleyball:
 Capturing its third straight Ancient Eight title (second outright), the Yale women’s volleyball team went a perfect 14-0 in conference play, dropping only six sets against the 42 it won. Junior Kendall Polan was named the Ivy League Player of the Year after finishing fifth in the conference in assists per set and tenth in kills per set. She led the team in assists, ranking third in kills, and produced seven triple-doubles (in kills, assists, and digs) during the season. Polan was later named a Division I Honorable Mention All-American.
 
Men’s Golf:
The Yale men’s golf team has proved to be the surprise of the season so far in the Ancient Eight. The sixth-place squad from last year is up to first, shooting ten shots better as a team (seven better versus par) and senior Brad Kushner and junior Sam Bernstein share the title of best golfer in the Ivy League—averaging an identical 72.43 round score (2.29 versus par). Colin Sheehan’s team has already captured a title on the year, winning the Macdonald Cup on September 30th.
 
Women’s Golf: 
 Having improved twelve strokes as a team since last year, the Yale women’s golf team currently stands third in the Ivy League. Two years after capturing seven titles, the Bulldogs have played more tournaments—five—than any other team and are tied for the league lead in wins with one. Although the team has no golfer in the top five, it is a model of consistency with five golfers in the top 20 and seven in the top 30. Number one golfer junior Seo Hee Moon has improved on a sophomore season where she ranked sixth in the Ancient Eight and won one of the eight tournaments she entered, shooting nearly two whole shots better versus par then in 2011-2012.
 
Girls’ Soccer:
 For the 10th time in eleven years, the Yale women’s soccer team finished with a winning record, albeit barely. The Bulldogs finished 8-7-2 overall, 1-4-2 in the Ivy League, and outscored opponents 20-9 in nonconference games before struggling to score against conference competition. Yale netted only six goals in seven conference games, but finished the year with five goals in four games. The Bulldogs were undefeated (2-0-2) in their last four contests and defeated Brown, 1-0, on Senior Night.
 
Boys’ Soccer:
 A year after four wins netted the Yale men’s soccer team a fifth place finish in the Ivy League, the Bulldogs finished with only one win but scored a sixth place finish. The Bulldogs defeated only Penn in their last nine games, coming away with three other ties and six losses in which they did not score a goal. This was a common theme for the Bulldogs, who never lost a game that they scored in. In postseason recognition, Junior Nick Alers was named a first team academic All-American after receiving honorable mention All-Ivy recognition for his play.
 
Field Hockey:
 A year after a last-game loss by the Princeton Tigers opened the door for the Yale field hockey team’s split conference championship, Yale stumbled to a 6-11 season and won only three of seven Ivy League contests. The team lost nine of thirteen after winning two of the first four and suffered shutout losses to BU, Virginia, Syracuse, Cornell, Princeton, Fairfield, and Connecticut. Goalkeeper Emily Cain ranked second in the conference in saves and sixth in save percentage but a distant seventh in goals against. No Bulldog ranked in the top ten in the conference in either assists of goals and its top point scorer, Erica Borgo, finished a distant twenty third in the Ancient Eight.

Ivy League basketball hosted a midseason teleconference last week with each head coach speaking about the state of their teams going into conference play. The Back Page brings you the most interesting and relevant statements by each coach.
&nbsp;
Yale coach Chris Gobrecht on freshman stepping up because of injuries:
“The biggest thing for us has just been bringing our freshman up to speed and getting our team healthy. We have not been a whole team yet this year.… We have a way that we play that is a very fast, very aggressive game, and it’s not an easy thing for a freshman to jump right in and play it. There’s nothing conventional about what we do, so it takes a while to catch on.”
<a name=""jump"">Princeton coach Courtney Banghart on guard Lauren Polanski’s return from injury and how it will affect playing time for the team’s other guards:
“She’s cleared, we’re just being conservative. We’re gaining valuable experience for other kids, and now that the league is here, she’s ready to get after it.… We’re better when we have more players healthy, so having [Polanski] back as the two-time reigning defensive player of the year—who’s quite disruptive and probably our best rebounder—will help us. We’ll get minutes for the kids who have earned it and the kids who help us win. My goal is to help the team win, not get any individual her highlight.”
&nbsp;
Penn coach Mike McLaughlin on overcoming a bad start:
“We opened the season and didn’t play that well our first time out. Then we bounced back against a good Virginia team at home, and although we came up short on the scoreboard, I did think we did some unbelievable things there…. We were involved in a lot of close games, and we were fortunate enough to win most of the ones we were in there. I think our confidence level is pretty good.”
&nbsp;
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith on replacing Brogan Berry: 
 “We added some new young players to our system and I have always believed that it takes time for that to come together, and I'm more than happy with how quickly they're growing and improving every day, every game… <a href=""http://gocrimson.com/sports/wbkb/2012-13/bios/curtis_ali_omvi"">Ali Curtis, basically a freshman because she didn't play at all last year, is our starting point guard and had to fill <a href=""http://gocrimson.com/sports/wbkb/2011-12/Bios/Berry_Brogan"">Brogan Berry's shoes, and I feel those are big shoes to fill. She's doing a great job and I'm surprised and actually thrilled with how quickly she's come in and led this team at the point for such a young player.”
&nbsp;
Dartmouth coach Chris Wielgus on her only senior, captain Faziah Steen:
“She just works so hard on her game. She’s so gentle and good with the young kids. She takes them under her wing. She’s worked very hard on her game in the offseason. She’s pretty much a standstill shooter, she can get herself to the rim now, she does a great job for us on the defensive end, and she’s overcome a lot of adversity herself. She’s had numerous surgeries. It’s her senior year and she’s as healthy as she’s ever been. We’re real pleased with her.”
&nbsp;
Cornell coach Dayna Smith on improving the backcourt’s consistency:
“We need to improve upon our consistency. I think that’s the thing our staff has been most disappointed in is just staying at a more consistent level game in and game out. But we’re making great strides and just excited for the opportunity to begin the Ivy League season.…
Our trio of guards has to step up and be more consistent with shooting, Shelby Lyman, Stephanie Long, and Taylor Flynn. We have games they’re on fire or two of three of them can really knock shots down, and it opens things up a little bit inside…. We just have to get more consistent with the three of them, and they’re all very, very capable of doing that.”
&nbsp;
Columbia coach Paul Nixon on the Lions’ 2-12 record:
“On paper right now the general public might not think that we’re a very good team, but I can assure you that the young women in our locker room and the staff know that the opinion that really matters is the one in our locker room. We don’t just believe, we know we’re a good basketball team, and we’ve shown that at a number of different points this season. We’ve played a number of games that we haven’t been able to quite pull out down the stretch, but we’ve gained some valuable experience.”
&nbsp;
Brown coach Jean Marie Burr on the start of conference play:
“We’re going through a tough patch coming off the Holy Cross game…. It’s nice for us to feel the pain of that and then watch them in practice [last Thursday] come back and work so hard. So, going into Ivy play is exciting. Back-to-back play makes it a tournament weekend every weekend….  I have players—every single one of them on my team—who have a passion for putting Brown across their chest, playing the game, and they’re just really competitive. When I have a group that I’m working with like that, I have to be excited, not just for Ivy League play but for the next game or the next practice.”

Today, Google is celebrating the 112th birthday of Frank Zamboni, the Italian-American inventor of the ice -resurfacing machine that bears his name, with an interactive doodle. Zamboni filed a patent for the ""Model A Zamboni Ice Resurfacer"" in 1949, 51 years after Harvard played its first intercollegiate game versus Brown. While The Crimson does not seem to have the Zamboni's Cambridge debut on record, the ice resurfacer's name has appeared in more than 70 Crimson articles. Many of these references are merely corny figures of speech, such as ""<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/3/mens-hockey-falls-to-brown-in/"">Zamboni-sized goose egg,"" ""<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/23/kolarik-coming-through-in-clutch-for/"">Zamboni-sized thighs,"" and ""<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1979/3/8/harvard-hockey-what-was-is-the/"">Zamboni of the mind,"" but the Zamboni has enjoyed a colorful history at Harvard. Here are the top three Zamboni-related Crimson stories to celebrate its creator's birthday:
3. December 5, 1973: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1973/12/6/big-green-rallies-to-trip-crimson/"">Zamboni-induced ditch foreshadows Dartmouth comeback
A Zamboni stalled in the middle of the ice during the second intermission of a closely-contested Harvard-Dartmouth men's hockey game at the Crimson's old home, the Donald C. Watson Rink. In an effort to get the ice resurfacer moving again, the Zamboni driver revved up the engine, which released ice-melting exhaust that created a substantial ditch in the rink. Before the third period's opening faceoff, the two teams agreed to trade sides of the ice 10 minutes into the final frame so that each team defended the defective area of the ice for an equal amount of time. While there is no indication that the ditch affected the game, the Big Green mounted a third period comeback, scoring two unanswered goals to win, 5-4.
2. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1996/11/2/jack-kirrane-making-his-final-rounds/"">Jack Kirrane, Zamboni driver and Olympic gold medalist, retires
Jack Kirrane served as the Bright Hockey Center's rink manager for 15 years. Before that, he was the captain of the U.S. Olympic hockey team. Kirrane led Team USA to its first Olympic hockey gold medal at the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley, Calif. The defenseman notably played alongside ‘Miracle On Ice’ coach Herb Brooks, who was cut from the U.S. Olympic roster a week before the 1960 opening ceremonies. Kirrane also served 38 years in the Brookline, Massachusetts Fire Department, and he was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987. But he may be best remembered by Crimson hockey fans as the Zamboni driver.
1. November 5, 2000: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/11/6/zambonis-send-smoke-into-ice-rink/"">Two Zambonis go up in flames
Well, not quite. One of Harvard's Zambonis appeared to catch fire before a Sunday afternoon women's hockey game against Minnesota. Despite a smoky Bright Hockey Center, the game could have started on time, but the Crimson's backup Zamboni also malfunctioned, apparently leaking battery acid or antifreeze onto the ice. After Harvard obtained a replacement Zamboni from the Massachusetts District Commission ice rink, the Crimson and the Gophers were able to play two days later. Unfortunately for Harvard, the Curse of the Zamboni struck again as Minnesota erased an early deficit to win, 3-2.

The Ides of January brought no relief to Jeremy Lin ’10 and his Houston Rockets team as they lost their fourth game of the week, falling this time to the Los Angeles Clippers, 117-109.
It was a tale of two halves in Tuesday’s contest as Houston controlled both the tempo and the score in the opening 24 minutes and, accordingly, held the lead at the break. But intermission seemed to be a breaking point in the game as only 50 seconds into the third quarter Los Angeles took the lead on a Blake Griffin put-back and never looked back. The Clippers would go on a 25-to-six run in the next 5:39, putting the game to bed long before the end of the third quarter.
“Honestly, I think we just couldn't get a rhythm,” explained Lin in his post-game interview. “[The Clippers] were getting everything but we were not getting any stops. I think we just lacked the ball movement and the energy and the thrust and pace that we played with in the first half.”
While his team struggled, Lin notched the only double-double of the night, putting up 12 points and 10 assists, 40 percent of the Rockets total dimes for the game. Though his efficiency rating was still in the negatives, -12, the Harvard alum was uncharacteristically low in turnovers, recording only one mistake in 35 minutes of playing time.
While the Clippers’ star point guard Chris Paul was out for the second consecutive game due to a bruised kneecap, LA’s backup guard, Eric Bledsoe, tied a team-high of 19 points. Bledsoe was one of four Clipper players to go 100 percent from the charity stripe, a marked contrast from the 56 percent free throw shooting of Lin’s Rockets.
Houston will have a chance to break its losing streak when it heads to Dallas for another intra-conference matchup against the Mavericks. That contest will be the first of a four-game road swing for this Rockets team, on which it will play only one squad boasting a winning percentage higher than .500.

Over a career spanning nearly half a century, psychology professor J. Richard Hackman garnered widespread esteem and accolades for pioneering the study of team dynamics. But on the side, Hackman quietly devoted countless hours to improving one team in particular—the Harvard women's basketball squad, for which he volunteered as an honorary coach.Those who knew him say that gestures like these defined Hackman, who died on Jan. 8 in Boston following complications from lung cancer. He was 72.“He really lived what he was studying,"" said Alexa S. Fishman ‘13, Hackman's thesis advisee. ""He wanted to help and give back to the undergraduate community.""By all accounts, Hackman was a model team player who practiced what he taught. He was at once a dry wit who knew how to lighten the mood with humor, an attentive mentor and colleague skilled at putting others at ease, and a maverick unafraid to voice dissent when the situation demanded it.According to psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert, Hackman’s brand of humor “wasn’t standard comedy.”
“He was funny, quirky, interesting,” Gilbert said. “He was not a guy who sat down and told canned jokes.”In a thesis prospective meeting with Hackman, Fishman recalled, Hackman deadpanned that her thesis proposal was not up to par. After she offered to take back her proposal, Hackman quickly reassured her that he was not being serious.“He said, ‘No, no, I’m joking, it’s totally fine,’” Fishman recalled. “He wanted to add a little humor to this meeting that sort of had to happen.”Hackman, who stood at a commanding six-foot-six-and-a-half stature, was known for taking every opportunity to relax.“It didn’t matter if he was sitting with the president of the University—when he got comfortable and sat down, he just took off his shoes,” Gilbert said. “If it was possible for him to lay down, he would also do that.”Those who knew him remembered Hackman for his natural generosity and attentiveness to others.“Everyone got his attention,” Fishman said. “When he spoke to you and he was talking to you, he was 100 percent focused on you.”Christopher M. Dial, Hackman’s assistant, said that in their conversations, Hackman was always concerned about how Dial and others were doing.“He and I would just chat about things that were just everyday,” Dial said. “I’ll miss someone who just checks in and wants to know how you’re doing.”Colleagues say this caring spirit was matched by an expansive intellect, one that contributed immensely to the field of organizational psychology.

Vans, motorbikes, and unusually large rats sped through the four-lane highway in Halong Bay. My mom paused at the sidewalk and looked both ways, then began to cross almost immediately. I guess the show of caution was just a formality.At first I thought it was some sort of test to see if my ears had been working for the first 12 years of my life. If they had, I would know the usual mantras: Always cross the street at the crosswalk. Don’t walk straight into traffic. The Little Mermaid is fiction.But my mom didn’t turn around and congratulate me with a gold star for my street crossing vigilance. She kept going. She walked steadily into the traffic, apparently oblivious to the honking horns and careening two-ton vehicles.So this is how my mom is going to die. Hit by a car in Vietnam.I looked at her destination, a two-star hotel across the street. Its rundown suites and functioning toilets hardly seemed worth the loss of a parent—although there was free Wi-Fi.
I wonder if my new mom will be a good cook.I looked at the rest of my family to see if they had any idea what was going on, or who my new mother would be. While my brother seemed to favor someone who could make a meatloaf, on the whole everyone just looked confused.“What is she doing?” my dad asked.What she was not doing (to everyone’s surprise) was getting hit by a vehicle. Each step brought her closer to successfully crossing the street without a single injury or vermin transmitted disease.At first I thought my mom was secretly some sort of gamer and was taking this opportunity to demonstrate her uncanny prowess at Frogger, but then I realized that she wasn’t doing anything at all. This was reverse Frogger. Reggorf: the less challenging and possibly made-up Vietnamese version of the classic arcade game where the cars and bikes dodge the people.Not wanting to miss out on a building with actual plumbing or to be left alone in this alternate universe where everything I learned as a child was backwards, I decided to follow my mother across the road. Levin family. Reggorf champions in the making.I looked left and then right, then left again, just in case I also had directions wrong. When there was a lull in traffic, I bolted. Still fearing for my life with what measure of self preservation I had, I spastically dodged nonexistent cars and imagined traffic. I made it to the other side of the road like a badly delivered chicken joke.“What were you thinking mom?” I panted, mopping the sweat off my brow and looking upwards in case I had missed any falling pianos or blimps.“That’s how they cross the road in Vietnam,” she replied. “I read it in the travel guide.”Now she tells me. I should really start reading those books.

Co-captain Jillian Dempsey only waited eight seconds to extend her point streak to 30 games Tuesday night against Connecticut. Junior Kalley Armstrong won the opening faceoff to classmate Lyndsey Fry, who advanced deep into the zone with the puck before dropping it back to Dempsey for a lightning-quick strike.The No. 2/3 Harvard women's hockey team never looked back after that. At the Bright Hockey Center, the Crimson (14-1-1, 11-0-0 ECAC) controlled the ice from start to finish to skate past UConn (3-17-2, 1-8-0 Hockey East), 5-1.""We like to talk about scoring early and often, so it was nice that we were able to do a little bit of both,"" Dempsey said.Dempsey turned in her fifth multi-goal performance of the season as she registered her 19th and 20th goals of the season. After drawing a roughing minor from the Huskies’ Margaret Zimmer to put Harvard on the man advantage, the senior  tapped in her second of the night off a rebound from sophomore defender Sarah Edney  to put Harvard up, 3-1, 5:30 into the second period.""[Dempsey's] consistency  and relentlessness are the best examples for any young player in the game,"" Crimson coach Katey Stone said. ""She's not trying to be fancy; she's just trying to be consistent.""
Harvard came roaring out of the gates, jumping out to a 2-0 lead after five minutes of play with a goal from senior Kaitlin Spurling. The forward skated the puck out from behind the Husky net before slinging a wrister from the slot.The Crimson dominated the first half of the first period, registering 13 shots on goal before UConn could muster one. But the Huskies found the net on their second shot of the game 15 minutes into the first with an unassisted marker from Kaitlin Hughes. The goal was the first tally by a visiting women's team at the Bright Hockey Center since Dec. 7.""That [goal] was a little bit frustrating, especially with how few shots they got on net, but it was good in the sense that [UConn] battled. We knew they were going to come hard, and everybody's going to play us as hard as they can and give us one of their best games,"" Dempsey said. ""It was a little bit of a challenge for us to figure out how we were going to respond to that, and we took that as incentive to work harder and put pucks on the net.""Harvard increased its stranglehold on the game after the first intermission. The Crimson added another two goals in the second frame while allowing only two shots on net.Three minutes after Dempsey's power play goal, Fry swatted a Connecticut lob pass out of the air at center ice to lead the Crimson on a 3-on-2 break. Fry slid the biscuit to Armstrong, who fed sophomore defender Michelle Picard in front of the net for Harvard's fourth strike of the night.""[Picard] has great timing,"" Stone said. ""She knows when to jump into a play; she has a good sense of where pucks are going to pop out.""Picard, who entered the month with zero career collegiate goals, now has three goals in Harvard's last five games.""Maybe a little bit of luck has just been finding the back of the net for me,"" Picard said, laughing. ""Since last year, Coach has been getting on all of us defensemen to join up in the play and make it a four-point attack. So I've been focusing on it, and recently for whatever reason they've been going in.""The Crimson cruised through the third period as freshman goaltender Molly Tissenbaum relieved co-captain Laura Bellamy in net. UConn only forced Tissenbaum to make two stops in twenty minutes as Harvard finished the night outshooting the Huskies, 42-8. Harvard's NCAA-leading penalty kill unit turned away all four UConn power play opportunities.""We used our speed really well today,"" Picard said. ""We didn't give them any time with the puck.""Junior Margaret Chute wrapped up the scoring for the Crimson as the forward buried a top-shelf backhand with eight minutes left to play off a game-high third assist from Armstrong. The goal was Chute's first of the season and second of her career.""[Chute] works so hard day in and day out and doesn't always get as many opportunities to go out there and show it,"" Dempsey said. ""For her to get that beautiful backhander today, we're all fired up about that.""With the win, Harvard extends its unbeaten streak to 11 games. The Crimson will wrap up its longest home stand of the season this weekend in ECAC tilts against RPI and Union.—Staff writer Michael D. Ledecky can be reached at mledecky@college.harvard.edu

After finishing just one season at the helm of the Harvard field hockey program, head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden has been named the interim head coach for the U.S. women’s national team. The first-year coach will head up the Team USA’s training camp in Chula Vista, CA. Van Herwaarden will oversee the national team as Craig Parnham, the newly appointed women’s national team head coach, takes time to move from his native England to the United States.<a name=""jump"">USA’s training camp will commence on January 28th, as the women’s national team prepares for the International Hockey Federation’s World League Round 2, held in early March in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Van Herwaarden has prior experience working with the American national teams. He was an assistant coach on the men’s side in 2007 through 2009. Prior to joining the Harvard coaching staff, he was an assistant coach at the University of Maryland, where he saw the Terrapins win five national championships during his tenure.
In a season full of injuries and some close calls, Van Herwaarden led Harvard to a 3-13 overall record and a tie for seventh place with Brown at the bottom of the Ivy League standings.

With a little less than a minute remaining in the fourth quarter, Linsanity was alive and well once more Wednesday night. Jeremy Lin ’10 had just scored 12 points in six minutes, bringing his Houston Rockets squad back from a double-digit deficit to within one of the Dallas Mavericks. But as Lin’s next shot from the charity stripe missed off the rim, Houston’s efforts fell short as well, and it ultimately lost, 105-100.
Lin’s onslaught in the final period, which made up a large portion of his team’s 15-4 closing run, totaled 74 percent of his points on the night. For the second straight game the Harvard alum shot just under 50 percent from the field while putting up a negative efficiency rating.
While Houston’s backcourt, consisting of Lin and shooting guard James Harden, had recorded an average of 6.74 turnovers per game prior to Wednesday’s contest, the duo almost doubled that number against Dallas. The two combined for 11 mistakes, something that Lin deemed to be a deciding factor in the contest.
“We were a little too nonchalant with our passes,” Lin said. “We tried to force it a couple of times. I had a key turnover down the stretch that was unnecessary.”
Harden echoed Lin’s sentiments, stressing the unnecessarily high level of difficulty that he believed Houston added to the contest.
“You’ve just got to make the easy play,” Harden explained. “We were trying to do a little too much, one extra dribble too much.”
With the loss, Houston’s fifth straight, the Rockets fall to 20-19 on the season, half of a game ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers for the eighth spot in the Western Conference. While Lin’s squad remains in playoff position at the moment, the tightly packed nature of the West means that it may take as little as three more losses to go from eighth to eleventh seed, from battling in the postseason to fighting for a better pick in the draft lottery. Houston heads to Indiana next, where it’ll take on a 24-16 Pacers team that trails the Miami Heat by only two games for the top spot in the East.

After a historic 2012 campaign, the Harvard men's volleyball team will open its season this weekend with two road games in the tri-state area. The Crimson squad will face the Stevens Institute of Technology (1-1) on Friday evening before taking on New York University on Saturday afternoon.Harvard, which finished second in the EIVA behind Penn State with a 10-4 conference mark and 18-6 overall record, achieved its first national ranking last year and returns most of the major players from last season. The Crimson was picked to finish fourth in the conference in a preseason poll.Harvard has not faced either opponent since the 2011 season. The Crimson swept Stevens, 3-0, in their last meeting but fell to NYU in five sets, 3-2. The Ducks, which compete at the DIII level, were voted to finish first in their conference, the UVC. The Violets, also members of the UVC, were chosen to finish third. Both teams are ranked in the top 15 nationally for DIII programs.Stevens, which went 28-8 overall and a perfect 12-0 in the UVC, reached the conference finals last year, falling to Nazareth College.The Ducks are led by a trio of outside hitters, senior Thomas Hannum, junior co-captain David Evans and junior Ryan Seifert. The group respectively had 344, 340 and 310 kills over the 2012 season. Seifert and Hannum register just under three kills per set while Evans notches 3.27 kills per set. This year, Seifert has already drilled 23 kills and Hannum has hit 21.
“They're outstanding players,” Stevens coach Patrick Dorywalski said. “Many of them could have played Division 1 but they chose Stevens because of the academics so that's a great thing for us. They're really well-skilled, talented players.”Sophomore setter Kevin Aeckerle leads the team in assists, accumulating 989 last season and 41 thus far this year. Aeckerle and Hannum also set the defensive effort for the team. Both have 10 digs this season.Senior middle hitter Jake Modestow is the primary blocker for the team. He tallied 173 blocks last season, the second-most in program history, and has eight this season.The Ducks have played two games this season, dropping the first against the University of Waterloo, 3-0, while prevailing on the road against the University of Puerto Rico, 3-2.“We only lost one of seven starters,” Dorywalski said. “I think it's going to be a great match. For a home opener, it's going to be quite a big match to start with but I think we're in good shape.”NYU, which will open its season against Harvard, also cruised to an undefeated 11-0 UVC season last year and went 20-9 overall.The Violets will return one of their three top hitters. Junior Nick Capriccio had the third-highest number of kills, with 257 and an average of 2.4 per set. The middle blocker also held team-highs in service aces, with 41 over the season, and blocks, tallying 69.Veteran setter Connor Mortland dished out 876 assists last season for an average of 10.68 and will be a threat at the net.“They're going to be pretty tough,” junior co-captain Nick Madden said. “We played them in the preseason this year and we beat them pretty handily but they were missing some key players who were all studying abroad so we have a pretty confident scouting report on them. I definitely want another shot after freshman year, so I'm excited.”Last season, the Crimson was led in kills by outside hitter Matt Jones '12. Jones, who registered 345 kills and 3.83 per set, currently starts for Volley Bartreng, a professional team in Luxembourg. The graduate holds the all-time program record in kills, service aces, and digs.

Different week. Different teams. Same result.Despite a jam-packed schedule with two weekend conference games followed by a Tuesday night showdown against Connecticut, the No. 2/3 Harvard women’s hockey team did just what it’s been doing all season long. It made winning look easy.The Crimson blanked both Princeton and Quinnipiac last weekend, then followed it up with a 5-1 routing of Connecticut three nights later.“We’re really happy with how we’re playing,” co-captain Laura Bellamy said. “We’re 5-0 in January, and it’s been nice to be on campus and just think about hockey. We’ve been happy with the way we’ve played [since the break].”With a 14-1-1 season record, the Crimson has seemingly faced little opposition from its competition so far this season, winning by an average of 4.64 goals.
The Crimson has a chance to keep its perfect 11-0 ECAC record intact when conference foes Rensselaer (6-14-2, 4-6-0 ECAC) and Union (7-12-3, 0-7-3 ECAC) travel to Bright Hockey Center for a pair of weekend matchups.“They’re both tough teams,” Bellamy said. “[They’re] really hard working.”First up for Harvard will be a rematch with RPI. When the two teams faced off two weeks ago, the Engineers gave the Crimson one of its toughest tests of the season. Harvard went up early in the second with a goal by junior forward Kalley Armstrong, but RPI fired back and squared the game up before the close of the period. A power-play goal by senior defender Kelsey Romatoski gave the Crimson the 2-1 lead it would maintain, but not without some close calls down the stretch.“We could’ve played better the last time when we played RPI,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “We owe them a big game, especially having them come to our rink.”Freshman forward Mari Mankey tallied RPI’s only score of the night, one of her four goals on the season. Fellow first year Alexa Gruschow leads the team with nine goals and ten assists on the season, good for a team-high 19 points.“I think the biggest thing is making sure they remember us a little better after this weekend,” Fry said. “We let it be to close last time we played them. We didn’t play Harvard hockey.”After that, Crimson will have a Saturday showdown against Union. Two weeks ago, Harvard breezed to a 9-0 victory when they travelled to Schenectady, New York to take on the Dutchwomen. It was the Crimson’s most dominating performance of the season, as Harvard saw seven different players score. Harvard outshot their opponent 42 to 13 on the evening.But even with such a commanding win, the Crimson does not underestimate Saturday night’s opponent.“Union’s going to throw everything at us,” Bellamy said. “Anytime someone comes to our home rink, we know they’re going to give it all they’ve got.”The weekend’s home stand will be the last time the Crimson plays at Bright for the rest of the month. Harvard has a pair of road stints lined up the next two weeks, as well as a Beanpot appearance to kick off its February contests.

My family loves to travel and observe nature, but we do not necessarily yearn to interact with the great outdoors. For example, we will all gather to watch a majestic summer thunderstorm, but we do it comfortably under a sturdy roof and behind window screens.Exploring Machu Picchu, a 15th century Inca site, with my family this January was therefore invariably a delight—although even before we landed, I knew that my parents were unprepared for Mother Nature's warm and insect-filled embrace.I learned quickly that Peru was also wet. As soon as we landed at the Aguas Calientes rail station, a steady downpour began with no intention of relenting for the weak-hearted.The second a raindrop touched the ground, umbrellas and raincoats popped up outside of the stores as if they were the understudy who finally got the chance to perform because the main actor called in sick.Once at the park entrance, we had one final test to retrace the path of Hiram Bingham, the Yale professor who stumbled upon Machu Picchu a little over a hundred years ago. We were going to hike up the mountain (a more historically accurate test would have required that we take artifacts and not return them until much later—not so lux or veritas after all, Hiram).
My family’s average physical aptitude and the high altitude resulted in a deceptively demanding climb. My mother, the clever and considerate woman that she is, allegedly only pretended to be completely out of breath in order to slow down my father, but the jury is still out. My sister and I would systematically check that a black orb was still behind us, as my father's windblown black poncho made him look like the Phantom of the Opera.When we finally reached Machu Picchu, the planes, trains, and automobiles were worth it. A never-ending line of vibrantly green peaks with a gushing river at their bases surrounded our insignificant bodies. Climbing over the stones strolled upon by my Inca counterparts 600 years ago, I truly was on an adventure.I was reminded of the C.S. Lewis quote: ""Don't use words too big for the subject. Don't say 'infinitely' when you mean 'very;' otherwise you'll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite."" With this moment as one of those scarce occasions in life when the word ""infinite"" seemed appropriate, I crossed the threshold of time into a pre-Columbian world.At each corner of the restored city, one word—how—prevailed on everyone’s lips. How did the Inca build a city in such a hidden place within the Andes? How is it possible to accurately predict the winter solstice by measuring the shade projections on the central rock from the east window in the Sun Temple? How did they split these massive stones to create such solid structures that have survived every earthquake? How did they fill up two circular receptacles with water in order to serve as ""mirrors"" for astral observations during clear nights? How did they construct a communication system using an understanding of sound wave travel in water to contact another compound 100 meters away? How did archeologists find tubes of rubber with small remnants of blood, an indication of a blood transfusion, in the ""hospital"" area?Our tour guide Fred related the theories about the Inca, emphasizing that they were a technologically advanced people who adapted to their environment and whose religious focus caused them to track celestial patterns.But I have a better, more rational theory: What if the Inca were helped by aliens? It would explain their remarkable understanding of astronomy, their impressive city, and their mysterious disappearance supposedly due to an epidemic and the arrival of the Spanish.While I attempt to gather more proof for my speculation, one thing is clear: Nothing is too extraordinary or impossible at the top of Machu Picchu—not even theories of alien assistance.

Governor William E. Russell presided and introduced the speakers in turn. Each speaker spoke for fifteen minutes.The debate was opened by R. D. Upton of Yale, who spoke on ""The party of progress and modern ideas."" Many things have been urged against the Democratic party, but it is essentially a party of reform, nominating Grover Cleveland, who become the head and consolidated that party, and won for it a glorious record. The Republican party, while it possessed great sentiments had also great unity, but when it lost them, it became broken. While the Republican party has became a party of selfish expedients, the Democratic party protects individual freedom. The Democratic party of today is a champion of peace, purity and reform. It stands for freedom and progression—a party which is, and not one which has been.<!--more-->January 15, 1920: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1920/1/15/getting-the-harvard-radicals-pthe-demand/"">""Getting"" The Harvard Radicals
The demand for the removal from office of Immigration Inspector Henry J. Skeffington is but a natural result of a steadily growing intolerable state of affairs. The government officials, the country at large, and the press seem possessed with a fear of a ""red revolution,"" an impossible and entirely remote contingency in this country. Anything liberal, or to the slightest degree unconventional in political and industrial theory, is being branded as revolutionary. Doubtless in times of over-fast development there are very real dangers incurred by the idle patter of ""parlor bolshevists."" But in times of reaction from liberalism such as the present there are still greater dangers in applying the epithet ""parlor bolshevist"" to anyone who dares assert an independent opinion. If this nation and the whole world do not watch their step carefully, the next decade will usher in a period of suppression on such a scale that in comparison the age of Metternich will appear as a mad whirl of anarchy.It is of moment that Mr. Skeffington claims he did not speak of the Liberal Club in particular, but that he merely said he would ""like to get some of these Harvard radicals."" The fact remains that he represents a point of view which cannot be allowed to prevail in the administration of our government unless we desire the rule of an intolerant aristocracy representing the ideas of only one class.January 13, 1938: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1938/1/13/harvard-vagabonds-to-have-access-to/"">Harvard Vagabonds To Have Access to Radcliffe SoonFor the first time in history, Harvard men will be permitted to attend a class at Radcliffe, namely one of two new music courses beginning there after midyears.Engaged last spring as visiting lecturer in music, Nadia Boulanger, French musician, will give two new courses, one of which, a graduate seminar in music competition, will be open to students from the brother institution, it was learned yesterday.January 14, 1955: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1955/1/14/lecturer-imperils-court-judge-says-pdr/"">Lecturer 'Imperils Court,' Judge SaysDr. Leona Baumgartner, a University Lecturer who doubles as a New York City Health Commissioner, was accused Tuesday by a Brooklyn magistrate of ""helping to wreck the whole judicial system.""A Visiting Lecturer in Maternal and Child Health, Dr. Baumgartner had publicly criticized a $50 fine, levied on a careless landlord by Magistrate Milton Solomon.

The Harvard men’s basketball team is already walking in Memphis, but the major challenge now facing it is walking out of the city with a win.Saturday’s contest against the Tigers at the FedEx Forum will mark the final non-conference tuneup for the Crimson (9-5), which began league play last week with a 75-65 road victory over Dartmouth.In that game, Harvard had to stave off a Big Green squad gunning for a major upset. On Saturday, it will be the Crimson that will be the heavy underdog against a Memphis team that began the year ranked No. 17 in the AP Top 25 poll and No. 16 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches’ poll and has gone 13-3 since.The Tigers’ lone losses this year have come versus Louisville (currently ranked No. 1 in the country), Minnesota (currently ranked No. 9), and Virginia Commonwealth (currently ranked No. 22), so going into Memphis and pulling out a win over one of the nation’s best mid-majors—winners of seven straight—will be an extremely tough task.“Memphis is incredibly talented,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “This is a team that can score a lot in bunches, they can get up and down the floor, [and] they’re very athletic.”
Despite the Tigers’ athleticism, Memphis is not the tallest of teams. Like Harvard, it starts three guards in Joe Jackson, D.J. Stephens, and Geron Johnson.Jackson, the Tigers’ leading scorer at 13.9 points per game, will most likely be defended by Crimson sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, as Amaker has often tasked his leading scorer with defending the opponent’s best perimeter player this season.Inside, 6’9” freshman center Shaq Goodwin will pose an especially tough matchup for 6’6” Crimson sophomore Jonah Travis.One of the top recruits in the nation last season, Goodwin is averaging 9.1 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. His presence inside could lead to more minutes for 6’8” sophomore Kenyatta Smith and 6’7” classmate Steve-Moundou Missi, who registered his best game of the season by scoring 15 points in 24 minutes off the bench against the Big Green.The Crimson bigs may seek to slow Goodwin by sending him to the line—where he is shooting just 64 percent—but more important to their interior success will be the ability to rebound.“They’re a big team, far bigger than us, so we have to really focus on boxing out,” freshman point guard Siyani Chambers said.“They’re very tough on the backboard,” Amaker added. “One of the Achilles heels for our team has been people being able to get on the glass and get second chance opportunities...[so] we’ve got to make sure we do a really good job there.”Like Goodwin, Chambers has put together an impressive freshman campaign of his own. After scoring a career-high 22 points against the Big Green, the point guard won his fourth Ivy Rookie of the Week honor, joining Saunders—who won his third Conference Player of the Week award—on the league’s honor roll.Saunders leads the conference with 16.4 points per game, while Chambers is seventh in the league at 13.3 points and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard is 10th with 11.4.But Amaker says if his team is going to emerge from Memphis victorious, more important than its ability to score will be its ball protection.

Although the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had not competed since late November, the squad did not appear to show any rust when it returned to action on Thursday.Racing against Brown (3-3, 0-3 Ivy) in Providence, R.I., the Crimson (4-0, 4-0) opened up an early lead and did not look back en route to a 206-90 victory over the Bears.Each of five Harvard swimmers earned two individual first-place finishes, and the Crimson failed to earn the top spot in only two of the 16 events. The team effort improved Harvard’s all-time record against Brown to 80-2.“I think we went into the meet with the right mentality,” freshman Christian Carbone said. “We knew that it wasn’t going to be an extremely difficult meet, but despite that everybody was fired up to race and give 100 percent…. We actually did med balls in the morning, and we lifted the afternoon before, so everybody was a little tired. But we gave it a good effort, and I think everybody was pretty pleased.”In the diving portion of the meet, sophomore Mike Mosca dominated each of his two events, besting the school records he set last year in both.
Mosca first took to the board in the 1-meter, where he posted a score of 372.45 to lay down a new high mark.But the sophomore was not done yet. Just a few minutes later, he set his second record of the night on the 3-meter board. The mark of 412.42 shattered the previous high by more than 17 points.“I’m obviously excited that I dove that well,” Mosca said. “If there’s any pool I want to dive well at, it’s the Brown pool because that’s where [Ivy League Championships] is going to be.”No other diver came close to Mosca, and he went on to win the two events by 74 and 85 points, respectively.“I thought [Mosca’s] performance was absolutely awesome,” Carbone said. “It’s just amazing what those guys do, with the mental preparation that goes into it. I know that they weren’t very rested for this meet either…. To be able to perform like this a week after very intensive training bodes excellently for the rest of the season.”Sophomore Chuck Katis contributed another solid performance for the Crimson. Katis took first in the 100-yard backstroke and the 200 IM, the latter of which he won by just under four seconds.Katis also helped Harvard to victory in the final event of the night, the 200 medley relay. Although the top Crimson lineup found itself trailing after the first leg, the squad clawed its way back to record its best time of the season and end the night on a high note.Junior Oliver Lee, sophomore Michael Gaudiani, and Carbone were the three other Harvard swimmers who achieved two first-place finishes in individual events.Like Katis, Lee propelled himself to a total of three top-spot finishes on the day. The sprinter took first in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle races, and he swam the third leg for the victorious 200 IM squad.Gaudiani shouldered some of the longer swims for the Crimson. He edged out the Bears’ Cory Mayfield by just over half a second in the 500 free, and closed out his night with a victory in the stroke’s 1000-yard event.

Three experienced mediators will take part in contract negotiations between Harvard and its clerical and technical workers beginning this week, according to <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/01/huctw-and-university-agree-to-engage-mediation-team-in-effort-to-reach-agreement/"">a joint statement released by the two sides Thursday.The mediators—Lawrence F. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard; Robert B. McKersie, a professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management; and Arnold M. Zack, a prominent arbitrator who has helped several U.S. presidents resolve labor disputes in the public sector—will attempt to help the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers reach an agreement that has eluded them <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/01/huctw-and-university-agree-to-engage-mediation-team-in-effort-to-reach-agreement/"">since talks began in April of last year.Contract negotiations have been far from straightforward, grappling with contentious topics including health care plans, salary increases, and, by extension, the financial health of the University.“While there has been a great deal of honest exchange, and some progress has been made, both sides have expressed the hope that mediation will help the parties constructively address differences over the salary increase program and health care issues,” read the statement.The contract that currently governs the relationship between Harvard and HUCTW was originally set to expire on June 30, 2012 but has remained in effect due to a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/7/8/huctw-contract-no-agreement/"">failure to ratify a new agreement by the July 1 deadline. HUCTW members include thousands of Harvard’s librarians, secretaries, lab technicians, and other non-faculty staff.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said he thinks the introduction of Katz, McKersie, and Zack into the negotiations is an encouraging development.“This is an impressive group of mediators, deeply trusted on both sides,"" Jaeger said. ""So it’s a positive step.”HUCTW and Harvard have used arbitrators to help negotiate previous contracts throughout the union’s 25-year history. In the current talks, negotiators began using a mediator late last summer, at which time <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/7/23/huctw-negotiations-mediation-letter/"">both sides expressed optimism that the introduction of a third party would be helpful.Following Thursday’s announcement, both Jaeger and a Harvard spokesperson declined to comment publicly on what progress has been made since those discussions and what exactly they hoped the new mediators might accomplish.—Staff writer Samuel Y. Weinstock can be reached at sweinstock@college.harvard.edu.

At the exact midway point of the NBA regular season, Jeremy Lin ’10’s Houston Rockets find themselves at a crossroads. By losing its sixth straight game Friday night in a 105-95 loss to the Indiana Pacers, Houston fell out of playoff standings. It currently sits a single hundredth of a percentage point behind the Portland Trail Blazers for the eight seed in the Western Conference.
Friday’s matchup was a tale of cat and mouse, the Rockets continually just short of making a competitive run against Indiana, always a few possessions out of real contention. Houston’s starting lineup combined for 15 turnovers, while the entire Pacers team recorded only 13 mistakes.
On the night, Lin tallied 10 points on four-for-seven shooting, including knocking down both of the shots that he took from beyond the arc. The Harvard alum also notched five rebounds and three assists.<a name=""jump"">While Lin shot efficiently, several of his teammates struggled from the field, and the squad shot just 41 percent for the contest.
“We were never able to build a lot of momentum at any point in the game,” Lin explained following the game. “When we get down that much at some point in time everything has to go your way for you to be able to get back in the game. We can’t keep putting ourselves in a position where we have to play a near-perfect game. It’s not one thing that we have to fix, we just have to go back to the basics, play better defense and do a better job rebounding.”
It was Paul George for Indiana who truly torched Houston, putting up 31 points behind a 7-of-10 shooting performance from downtown. The third-year player also nabbed five steals, 3.6 more than his career average. Additionally, George had the assignment of covering James Harden, a player who has averaged over 26 points per game this season. On Friday night though, Harden was kept to 17 points on 26 percent shooting.
Lin and the Rockets will have little rest before starting the second half of their regular season Saturday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves. While its star player Kevin Love will be out due to injury, Minnesota enters Saturday’s contest only two and a half games back of Houston for the ninth spot in the West.

I drove by my old house once. That was a luxury I felt I could allow myself. I rolled past the driveway in my beat up Suburban and peered in. The house appeared to be basically the same, but it seemed as if my family had already been forgotten. I didn’t linger—I knew the new, sole tenant would not like to see me staring—I pressed the pedal and roared on my way.As we unloaded our cars into the Marriott Hotel that would be our home for the interim, I asked my parents if we could have waited to move until after I was done with break. I knew the answer was going to be a definitive “no,” but I felt justified in asking. I wasn’t exactly looking forward to living out of a hotel for my few weeks away from school. My mom surveyed our temporary home, “Well, at least after a month in here the new house will feel huge,”  she concluded as the rest of us piled our belongings on the sidewalk.  The place was certainly small, and I had to share a bed with my sister. Though it wasn’t all bad. The hotel allowed pets, so I made a game of running our golden retriever up and down the halls. Our cat, meanwhile, got lost when the maids came in to vacuum and make my bed. We found her two days later, yowling in an empty hotel room. There was a Jacuzzi which we raved about all the time, but only used once. Tea was served in the front lobby. I enthusiastically related all this to my friends who would invariably ask about the really important changes: “So, no New Year’s Party?” The hotel put together themed social events for us during weeknights. Monday is Nacho Night, Tuesday is BBQ, and so on. We got along with the employees, who all knew us by name (or at least said “you” in a more meaningful way than usual), but had no desire to meet any of the other tenants. Once, my parents and I sidled into BBQ night, grabbed a few plates of hamburgers and potato salad and attempted to sneak back to the room with minimum social interaction. Erin, the girl who ran the front desk, smirked as we snuck by, and said to me, “What, you’re still here?” “Yep, I’m around for another week,” I replied, before turning up the hallway. We became stable faces in a place where most people come and go freely, locals within a community of visitors.  
One day, my parents brought my siblings and me to the new house with a few beers and some cheese and crackers to get a first impression of the place. We wandered across the threshold into a gutted, stark interior. We set the food in the middle of the room and sat on the floor, munching. Mom gushed about her plans for the house: the walls they’d tear down, the paints they’d try, the rooms they’d create. “It’s definitely a project,” she admitted. It definitely wasn’t home to me, yet. As the rest of my family occupied themselves with beer and brie, I wandered around my future home and started buying into the vision. It might not be home yet, but it sure beat the Marriott. I rejoined the others in what will be our new family room, and toasted to a new beginning.

The Vatican has invited Jeremy Lin ’10 to join a holy tag-team to take down Lance Armstrong.
The <a href=""http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1300195.htm "">Catholic News Service (CNS) reported Wednesday that the Pontifical Council of Culture hopes to host an international conference with prominent Christian athletic leaders to promote sporting values. Lin and NFL quarterback Tim Tebow are among the Vatican's invitees.<a name=""jump"">
The announcement came a day before seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong's cheating admissions aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Monsignor Melchor Sanchez de Toca Alameda, head of the Council's ""Culture and Sport"" section, described Armstrong's confession as ""just the tip of the iceberg"" to the CNS. Monsignor Sanchez de Toca said that the council plans to address the pressures of doping and commoditization within professional athletics.
According to the CNS, the Vatican City conference would take place sometime this spring. While Tebow would likely have few football-based commitments during that time frame, Lin could be in the middle of a playoff push.
But if the Houston Rockets, who currently sit eighth in the Western Conference, continue to have trouble collecting wins, Lin should have some free time on his hands come post-season.  If Lin does attend the ecumenical conference, he would be expected ""to give witness to how the worlds of faith and sports can easily come together,"" according to the CNS.
<a href=""https://twitter.com/Pontifex "">After a month on Twitter, His Holiness may have learned one thing: a little bit of Linsanity and Tebowmania can go a long way.

In its fifteenth straight win at the Bright Hockey Center, the Harvard women’s hockey team (15-1-1, 12-0-0 ECAC) rolled over the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Engineers (6-15-2, 4-7-0 ECAC), 4-1, to stay undefeated in conference play.Both teams started quickly, scoring three goals within a four-minute span in the opening period. The Crimson led, 2-1, after the first but found itself tied in shots on goal, 10 to 10, and unable to convert its only power play opportunity before heading into the first intermission.In the next two periods, Harvard out-shot RPI, 23-5, and surrendered no goals on two power play opportunities. The Crimson took advantage of a five-on-three power play of its own to add its fourth goal of the evening early in the third period. The score took place on a redirection shot by junior Lyndsey Fry, placing the puck in the top left corner of the net for her second goal of the evening.“I think that we were ready to go coming in,” coach Katey Stone said. “However, I think that we worked a little bit harder in the second and third period. We came up with a few more one-on-one pucks and didn’t turn the puck over as much. I think it was a greater sense of urgency and more communication. These games are all pretty tough and we have to get in the habit of playing in some real dogfights.”Fry agreed with her coach, stating that the early goal by RPI—a power play goal by Engineer junior Taylor Horton—got the team re-focused. Two minutes after the Horton score, Fry knocked an RPI pass into the boards and skated past two Engineer defenders before slapping the puck past the outstretched arm of the goalie. The goal gave Harvard an advantage that it never relinquished.
“You get a little slap in the face there when they score a goal,” Fry said. “You remember that they are coming to play. The biggest thing that we have to keep in mind when we play is that the success we’ve been having means that every team that comes in here has their Stanley Cup game.”Sophomore Crimson defender Michelle Picard sparked the inception of the night’s offense when she intercepted a pass deep in RPI territory, starting a breakaway before flicking a wrist shot into the top left corner of the goal to give Harvard its initial advantage. Picard had a team high plus-minus of +2 on the day and her three shots on goal were tied for third on the team.Senior Jillian Dempsey, the team’s leading shot-taker, managed six shots on goal but had her thirty-game point streak snapped. The streak, which dated back to last season, was the longest in the nation.Friday’s contest marked the Crimson’s sixth win and thirteenth unbeaten contest in a row. The match-up was the fourth in a five-game homestand that culminates on Saturday against Union. Stone said that with nearly half the regular season—12 of 29 games—to go, the team still has a lot to work on.“We’re trying improve in every facet of the game and not just one or two,” Stone explained. “We’ve been doing well grinding it out, playing tough, and being physical. We’ll do whatever we need to [in order] to get the win.”The victory was the team’s second this season against the Engineers, having defeated them, 2-1, on the road earlier this month. In every game, Fry said, whether at home or on the road, it is key to approach the opponents in a similar fashion and focus on what the team can control—its own play.“Last time we played them we weren’t playing our game,” Fry said. “The biggest thing was coming out and focusing on us and what we were doing instead of what they were doing. Obviously we watched film and prepared for what they were going to bring at us but the biggest difference between last game and this game is making sure we focus on what we were going to do. We did the little things well today.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

After four years playing goalie for the Harvard women’s soccer team and four different assistant coaching stints, Katie Shields ’06 has been named head coach of the Saint Louis University women’s team.<a name=""jump"">The former goalie served as an assistant coach at Harvard for the 2007-09 seasons, helping guide the Crimson to a combined 29-16-7 record that included two Ivy League titles. Shields was an assistant coach for the Billikens last season, and she also served stints at Northwestern and UC Irvine.
""I am thrilled and honored to be the head women's soccer coach at Saint Louis University,"" Shields said in an article on GoCrimson.com. ""I am grateful to [vice president for student development] Dr. Kent Porterfield, Chris May, and [associate director of athletics] Janet Oberle for believing in me and my vision to lead the SLU women's soccer program.”
Saint Louis compiled a 5-9-4 record last season. As the team will graduate only four players, Shields should have ample time to work with and improve her core squad in the offseason.
Shields ranks fourth in Harvard program history with 272 career saves, and she anchored a 2004 Crimson team that earned an appearance in the NCAA tournament. Named team captain her senior year, the goalie was voted onto the All-Ivy squad each of her four seasons.

In its opening game of the season, the Harvard men’s volleyball team repeated its 2011 performance against the Stevens Institute of Technology and swept the Ducks (1-2), 3-0.Sophomore outside hitter DJ White led the scoring effort for the Crimson (1-0), notching a game-high 19 kills on 29 attack attempts and recording a hitting percentage of .552 along the way. White was just one kill short of his season-high from last year. He also provided one of the team’s two service aces.“I feel great but it’s a team game,” White said. “Rob [Lothman] played really well and set me up nicely. Chris [Gibbons] was a big help passing, he was nails all night. I think that really helped my performance.”It was a strong collegiate debut for freshman Branden Clemens, who saw time in all three sets at outside hitter. Clemens had five kills over nine attempts and dove for five digs, second-highest on the team behind junior co-captain Nick Madden who had eight.“There’s a lot of responsibility in his position,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “He’s receiving serves but Rob, our setter, did a good job of putting the ball where he likes it. He’s a really experienced player even for a freshman and I think it showed that he was able to come into this kind of environment and play the way he did.”
Lothman, who is also a co-captain, handed out 35 of the team’s 43 assists on the night.The Crimson, which had a team-wide kill percentage of .348, held Stevens to just .169 percent hitting and three successful blocks. The Ducks’ offensive effort was largely driven by junior outside hitter Ryan Seifert, who had 11 kills on the night over his 27 attack attempts. Seifert also committed a game-high six errors.Senior outside hitter Thomas Hannum, last season’s leading scorer for Stevens, registered just five kills and a hitting percentage of .200 on Friday night. Hannum had hit 14 kills in his squad’s last game and held a team-high kill percentage of .316.The first set started out with back-and-forth scoring between the two teams, until a kill by Clemens gave Harvard its first multi-point lead, 15-13. From there, the Crimson extended its lead to as large as five as White drilled kill after kill. While a first set point saw a service error by junior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper, the second was successful, as Madden attacked and the Ducks provided a block error to give Harvard the set, 25-20.“I think our defense could have been a little bit better early on but I thought we were pretty efficient in the way we played,” Baise explained.The second frame was more dominant for the Crimson. A team effort created a 9-1 run for Harvard and set up a 16-7 lead. The two teams would trade off in scoring, but three final kills by White gave the Crimson the second set, 25-16. Harvard tallied a kill percentage of .406 during the set.“Last year we kind of had a let down after game one,” White said. “We used to really run game ones and then lose out, so this year I’m trying to keep momentum through the second and third games since those are usually the biggest ones.”While Stevens jumped to a slim advantage, 5-3, in the third set, the Crimson turned the tables with a 6-2 run and would never relinquish the lead. At the close of the final stanza, a block by junior Michael Owen gave Harvard its 23rd point and a kill by sophomore Caleb Zimmick would push the game to match point. Despite a final attack from Seifert, Zimmick put it away, assisted by senior setter Derek Jansma, and the Crimson won the match, 25-20.“I was really happy to see that we settled into a rhythm,” Baise said. “I knew we would get there. We’ve been real good in practice. I didn’t know if it would be tonight but really by game two we were the team we’ve been working to put out there.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

MEMPHIS—In the second half of the Harvard men's basketball team's matchup with Memphis, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers took it inside the paint and secured a layup for the Crimson, leveling the score for the first time at 44-44.After a defensive rebound with eight minutes remaining, the visitors looked to take their first lead of the game. Sophomore forward Moundou-Missi secured the Harvard lead with a dunk, but the moment was short-lived, as Tigers forward D.J. Stephens answered with two points of his own for Memphis. The Tigers (14-3) never allowed another Crimson (9-6) lead, ultimately winning, 60-50.“I was really proud of the guys—how we fought back to really make it a game and actually take the lead in this game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We did some really good things in the second half. The way we started the game, we were knocked on our heels with their energy and their effort right away. I thought that was the difference.”Harvard had a tough go of things in the first half, committing 13 turnovers and going 5 of 19 on field-goal attempts before heading into the locker room at the end of the first period down 32-16 at the FedEx Forum.“I felt like we weren’t aggressive,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “We weren’t doing what we’ve been doing the whole season. Obviously on the backboard they got too many offensive rebounds, and we weren’t able to get in the paint at all, and that really hurt us a lot.”
Webster led the Crimson in the first half with two steals and five points, three of which came from an on-target shot far outside the arc with 12:26 remaining in the half. Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard sunk the Crimson’s second and final three-pointer of the period in the 15th minute of the first half.Harvard's defense struggled to defend freshman forward Shaq Goodwin, who led the Tigers with eight points and five assists heading into halftime. The Crimson failed to protect the paint, allowing Memphis players to score 20 points down low.Harvard finished the period shooting 26 percent, well below the Memphis field goal percentage of 36. The Crimson only registered one offensive rebound.“[Memphis] played very well,” Amaker said. “I think they came out and played incredibly hard and put us on our heels…and I thought it really hurt us right away. We needed to take care of the ball, and we needed to box out and keep them off the backboard.”Harvard gained momentum in the second period with an 11-0 run spanning four minutes. Chambers scored two points on a jumper with 16:08 minutes remaining, bringing the score to 36-24.Memphis failed to answer offensively, and sophomore forward Wesley Saunders extended the Crimson scoring streak with a three-pointer and a layup heading into the fifth minute of the half. The Tigers’ Joe Jackson cut the Harvard streak short by finishing an old-fashioned three-point play, putting the Crimson deficit at seven points.“We just tried to relax, just play our game,” Webster said. “It wasn’t really about X’s and O’s. It was just about digging in and actually playing. I feel like we were tense [in the first half]. I don’t know if it was the big arena or what, but I felt like we were not being ourselves, and that’s what we tried to do in the second half.”With five straight points, Rivard decreased the Tigers' lead to five, 44-39. After Saunders sunk two free throws of his own, the Tigers suffered a turnover on offense, allowing the Crimson another attempt on offense.“I thought we showed a lot of fight—a lot of toughness—just to get back into the game, “ Webster said. “And with a team like Memphis, you can’t dig a hole for yourself.”A dunk from Crawford with six seconds remaining was the final basket, ending the game with a 10-point Crimson loss.“I think [the Tigers] are as good as advertised,” Amacker said. “They’re explosive, they’re athletic.""Saunders led Harvard with 11 points and three steals, while Moundou-Missi chipped in with 10 points. Chambers directed the offense, registering seven assists by the end of the matchup, but also finishing with seven turnovers.—Staff writer Kelley Guinn McArtor can be reached at kelleyguinnmcartor@college.harvard.edu.

Still in search of its first league win of 2013, the Harvard men’s hockey team dropped a 5-2 contest to its oldest rival, Brown, Saturday evening at the Meehan Auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island.The last time the Crimson (5-10-1, 3-8-0 ECAC) squared off against the Bears (6-8-4, 2-5-4 ECAC), the then-13th ranked Harvard squad defeated Brown for its third straight win, and looked poised to make a strong run in the 2012-2013 campaign.Since then, the Crimson has struggled to find consistency, losing its sixth straight ECAC game since its win against Cornell back in mid-November. Harvard’s lone victory since that win came in last week’s overtime thriller against BU.The Bears rode a four-goal outburst in the second period to come away with a win that propels Brown above the now last place Crimson in the ECAC standings.“I thought we played a good first period, we outshot them and we won a majority of the face-offs,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “In the second [period] they outplayed us, they outworked us, they beat us to pucks in the scoring areas, they had multiple whacks at pucks, the game certainly was decided in the second period.”
The Crimson was able to open the scoring with a goal from sophomore Tommy O’Regan at 2:04 early in the second, with freshman Brian Hart finding the forward on a two-on-one from the right circle.But the Bears netted four straight goals thereafter, knotting the score at one less than a minute after O’Regan’s goal. The visitors did not score until the end of the second period, where Hart made it 4-2, but Brown did not let Harvard come any closer as it closed out the game in the third to split the season series at one.Soon after the Crimson initiated the scoring, Brown sophomore Matt Lorito broke the puck away from the defense near the left crease, wrapped it around the net and passed it up to junior Garnet Hathaway in front of the net, who buried the shot for his second goal of the year.The Bears then pulled away with two quick goals in a span of just over a minute with goals by senior Chris Zaires and sophomore Ryan Jacobson. Zaires was able to score after the puck bounced around a bit on a rebound from a shot off a faceoff, while Jacobson found the left side of the net open after a crisp pass from Lorito on the right.Brown finally made it 4-1 after a pass up from behind the net from Dennis Robertson found Lorito open in center; the team’s leading scorer then fired a shot on net, and the rebound bounced out to Nick Lappin who put it in for the power-play goal.Throughout the game the Bears were strong in front of the net, winning many battles against Harvard on both sides of the ice.“The [Brown] forwards were playing hard and going to the net and getting a lot of rebounds,” Hart said. “I thought they were good in front of our net and that’s where we need to get better.”Shutout in the last three games on the power play, the Crimson finished 0-5 on the evening.“We’ve had some good looks but we just haven’t been consistent,” Donato said. “We haven’t been able to get pucks through from the point I think that’s been a killer. [There’s been a] ton of shot blocked, and then when we have we haven’t really won any the battles in front of the net or rebounds so that’s something that we’ll have to improve on greatly if we’re going to have some success.”Harvard was able to respond at the end of the period with a goal by Hart assisted by fellow freshman forward Jimmy Vesey and junior defenseman Dan Ford on a four-on-four opportunity to the lead to two.

Watching the Harvard women’s hockey team face Union Saturday, you wouldn’t believe that it was the Crimson’s lowest-scoring win this season.Harvard (16-1-1, 16-0 ECAC) dominated the possession game at Bright Hockey Arena, keeping the puck in the attacking zone for most of the contest and pounding shot after shot at Union goaltender Shenae Lundberg. The Crimson extended its fourteen-game unbeaten streak in a 1-0 shutout, a far cry from the 9-0 victory over the Dutchwomen (17-14-3, 0-9-3 ECAC) it collected earlier this month.“I have to say that they definitely stepped it up defensively, and their goaltender was much more ready to go this time around,” said co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey, who tallied Harvard’s only goal. “We embarrassed them last time with a 9-0 win, so they were definitely not going to let that happen again.”After 22 shots in 35 minutes of scoreless play, the Crimson finally found the back of the net in the second period. With Dutchwoman forward Stefanie Thomson in the penalty box for boarding, sophomore defender Sarah Edney received a pass from sophomore forward Samantha Reber and took a shot from the top of the zone.Unlike the other 34 times Harvard took it to the net during the game, Lundberg was not able to hold onto the puck and make the save. As it bounced off her pads, Dempsey was there to finish the play from the left side.
“One of our focuses before the game was that we wanted to score on the power play,” Dempsey said. “Edney was at the blue line, and she took a great shot from the point, and I was just able to be there for the rebound.”Dempsey’s goal was the only time Harvard would find its way past Lundberg, who let in six goals in the last matchup between the two teams. Playing behind a strong defense that crowded the attacking zone, Lundberg made acrobatic stops that kept the Crimson off the board in the first period.Harvard’s best looks came early in the frame, when senior forward Lyndsey Fry—who led the Crimson with seven shots—attempted a wrap-around from the left side that ricocheted off Dutchwoman defender Haley Welch. Fry caught the rebound and fired it straight back into Lundberg, and she added two more shots before the first five minutes of the game had elapsed.“We were moving it around, but the thing is, you can cycle it and keep it on the outside all day long,” Fry said. “At the end of the day, we have to get to the net and get more pucks in the net. We had a lot of shots, and they weren’t going in for us today, but all we needed was one.”Harvard’s defense looked untouchable in the first 10 minutes of the frame, as they outshot Union, 12-0, to open the game. The Dutchwomen’s best chance came early in the second period, with sophomore forward Hillary Crowe off the ice for tripping. Union defenders Kelly Norton and Maddy McGrath alternated on four consecutive shots that were turned away by the Crimson’s remaining four skaters.As the puck bounced around in front of the net, Dutchwoman defender Ashley Johnston took the final shot of the power play opportunity, which was stifled by Harvard goaltender Laura Bellamy—who notched seven saves and leads the country with a 96.8 percent save percentage. With the penalty kill—the first of two on the night—the Crimson’s nation-leading record improved to 56-of-58.In the second period, the Crimson looked more aggressive in front of the net, driving to the goal and taking shots from close. With Crowe back on the ice, Harvard pounded the attack zone with ten consecutive shots, finally drawing the penalty that led to its power-play goal. With Union a man down, it took the Crimson only 17 seconds to find the back of the net.“We tried to just find a way to get pucks in and just get different looks at the net, get some traffic going, but it was difficult,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said.Union got one last look at the end of the third period after pulling Lundberg to add an extra skater, but Dutchwoman defender Alex Tancrell-Fontaine’s Hail Mary shot with seconds on the clock went wide, and the Crimson extended its home winning streak to a full calendar year in its ninth shutout of the season.“The composure we had at the end, that’s something positive that we were really happy about,” Dempsey said. “These experiences, we’re grateful for these later down the line because we’d rather have them under our belt and know what it’s like to be in those tough situations now instead of in a one-game elimination.”—Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu.

After its first loss in nearly two years, the Harvard women’s squash team wasn’t about to let defeat become a pattern.Following a narrow 5-4 loss to Princeton last week, the second-ranked Crimson (7-1, 2-1 Ivy) took on no. 16 Hamilton (2-6) and no. 9 Amherst (8-4) at the Pioneer Round Robin at the Jeffs’ Davenport Courts. Harvard bounced back from its only loss of the season in decisive fashion on Saturday afternoon, sweeping both teams for a combined 18-0 tally.“We came out really strong, and I think the results speak for themselves,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “Especially coming off of a tough weekend, we really looked at this week to regroup and look forward, and I think that these matches, although they’re not quite the same test that our Ivy matches are, inspire us to keep moving forward as we approach Columbia and Cornell in two weeks and Trinity and Yale.”The interlude between Ivy play not only gave the Crimson a chance to rebound from the Tigers, but also offered an opportunity to give less experienced players a chance to compete as part of the nine scoring matches.“It’s a wonderful opportunity for girls on the low end of the ladder to get competitive matches,” Kingshott said. “Only the top nine play, but we do have a roster of 16, and the girls at the bottom put in as many hours and contribute as much to the team as the top nine, so for a lot of the girls to step up and show the hard work that they put in is really wonderful.”
Although last week’s setback at the hands of Princeton was foreign to a team that hadn’t lost since 2011, assistant coach Luke Hammond notes that the match gave the team pieces to work on that led to the victories this weekend.“I think the confidence has been coming back for many of them individually all week,” Hammond said. “We’ve been going back, working on things, working on the mental aspect of the game and really trying to work everybody back to top form. A bunch of the girls who didn’t play well against Princeton have been playing better over the course of the week, so we’re feeling pretty good now.”HARVARD 9, AMHERST 0After routing the Continentals earlier in the day, the Crimson continued its show of dominance, dropping only three games en route to its 9-0 victory over the home team.The closest contests came at the bottom of the ladder, in the matches of eighth-seeded junior Natasha Anzik and ninth-seeded junior Georgiana Brinkley. Anzik won the first game but dropped the next two before coming back strong to take the fourth and fifth games, downing her opponent, 3-2. Brinkley scored a 3-1 victory, losing her third game before notching an 11-4 victory in the fourth.“For Natasha Anzik and Georgie Brinkley to get time on court today and really have a full team out in support for them was great,” Kingcott said.Despite playing Hamilton just a few hours before taking to the courts to face Amherst, the team showed little sign of fatigue, with its top seven posting shutouts across the board.“Some weekends [fatigue] can be a factor, but this weekend I don’t think it was too bad,” Hammond said. “We had a couple hours for lunch, so they weren’t too close together. It was a pretty early wakeup call, they had to wake up at 6 AM, so there was that factor, but I don’t think the kids were too tired.”Freshman Isabelle Dowling, who moved from the no. 8 spot to the fourth seed, played two hotly contested games against her opponent, winning her first and third games, 12-10.HARVARD 9, HAMILTON 0The Crimson started out its day with a rout over the Continentals, winning each match 3-0. The battle was the first ever between Harvard and Hamilton.“I don’t remember ever playing Hamilton before, so it’s always good to play new schools,” senior Laura Gemmel said. “Everyone was excited, it’s always exciting to play a team for the first time.”Despite not playing the normally top-seeded sophomore Amanda Sobhy or fifth-seeded Saumya Karki, Harvard had no problems taking care of business against Hamilton, with the closest game coming in an 11-8 victory for Dowling in her shutout of Isabelle Weisman.“[Sitting out Sobhy and Karki] was really to do with the fact that we want those girls who are usually right on the edge of being able to play in the nine,” Hammond said. “We like to get them into the official nine if we can. But we still have to respect them and be careful with Hamilton and Amherst, because those are two good teams.”

The Harvard wrestling team found itself facing tough competition in No. 6 Cornell on Saturday at the Malkin Athletic Center. And although the Crimson remained in contention entering the final match, the team ultimately fell to the Big Red, 24-15.The meet was tied, 9-9, at the midway point, but Cornell pulled away by winning three of the final five matches, two by falls, to secure the bonus points that would help decide the contest.Although all of the Big Red’s wrestlers had winning records, with four ranked within the top 15 of their respective weight classes, Harvard was able to win five of the ten matches on the night.“I just thought that every one of our guys wrestled hard,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “And that’s all I asked of them going into the match. I said that I don’t care about outcome; I just want you to focus on maximum effort and try to do something a little extraordinary. And I think they did, and that’s going to really help us.”Freshman Jeff Ott started the evening off against Nahshon Garrett of Cornell. Although Ott led after the first period, Garrett went on an 11-1 run to seal the victory and his second win of the year over the Crimson freshman.
After Harvard sophomore Ryan Osleeb managed to snag a tight 3-2 victory at 133 lbs, co-captain Steven Keith was dominant from start to finish and to defeat his opponent, 8-1. The two consecutive victories gave Harvard a 6-4 lead.“If we wrestle that way with that kind of intensity, hard for seven minutes, taking it to whoever we’re wrestling, [then] we’re going to break a lot of teams and hopefully pull out some wins against some good teams,” sophomore James Fox said.But the Big Red fought back to seize the advantage as Chris Villalonga secured bonus points with a technical fall over freshman Todd Preston.Although he was nearly pinned at the end of the final period, Crimson co-captain Walter Peppelman managed to hang on and earn his 99th career victory in a 1-0 decision.With the score tied at nine apiece, Harvard freshman Devon Gobbo was sent out to take on three-time national champion and No. 1 Kyle Dake, who pinned Gobbo in the second minute. Dake has needed just over three total minutes to pin each of his three Ivy League opponents so far this season.At 174 lbs, junior Cameron Croy edged out the Big Red’s Marshall Peppelman, younger brother of the Crimson’s Walter, by a score of 4-3.“We were winning those close bouts, and you like to see that,” Weiss said. “Because when the pressure mounts, you have to be able to perform at your best, and I think our guys did.”Fourth-ranked Steve Bosak, a defending national champion, came out strong and pinned sophomore Josh Popple of Harvard to push the Cornell lead to nine.In the penultimate match of the day, Fox snagged an 8-5 victory in a back-and-forth bout at 197 lbs, and the Crimson still found itself with a chance to win going into the heavyweight battle. But sophomore David Ng was not able to take down his opponent and fell, 4-2, to seal the Big Red victory.The wrestlers had the opportunity to perform in an electric environment on Saturday. The bleachers at the MAC were completely full, and some onlookers were forced to either stand or sit on the floor.“The atmosphere was awesome,” Fox said. “That was as packed as I’ve seen the MAC, and coach said that’s packed as he’s seen the MAC in his twenty years here. We were definitely able to feed off the energy…. I wish all home matches look like that from now on…because it was amazing.”Harvard was Cornell’s second opponent of the day, as the Big Red arrived in Cambridge fresh off a 35-6 victory over Brown in Providence just five hours earlier.Losing by nine points to a team of Cornell’s caliber, which has gone 2-2 against schools ranked in the top ten so far this year, is viewed by the Crimson as a step in the right direction.“I think we’re definitely encouraged, but at the same time we want to be a team like Cornell; that’s why we’re in the business,” Weiss said. “I think this has got to help the guys. Yes, we are encouraged, but we know we have more to do.”

Following a 3-0 sweep at the Stevens Institute of Technology on Friday night, the Harvard men’s volleyball repeated a dominant performance and blanked New York University, 3-0, on Saturday at the Jerome S. Coles Center. The two teams had last met in 2011, when the Crimson fell in five sets, not one of which was decided by more than five points.Harvard (2-0) was propelled against the Violets (0-1) by a group effort that saw all but three members of the team receive playing time.“These pre-league matches are important in that way,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “It’s a long season. A lot of different guys are going to play a role this year.”While Harvard may have been aggressive on defense, stifling NYU to a -.047 hitting percentage as a team and out-blocking its opponents 12 to seven, the first set saw the Crimson squad give up 14 points on unforced errors, eight off serves, and six off kills.“We worked on our serving a lot,” Baise said. “We know it’s an important part of our game and it’s always going to be a struggle... You can see a difference from the first to the second game. The second game we were really in control.”
Junior co-captain Nick Madden led the scoring effort for Harvard. The opposite hitter dished out a game-high 13 kills and the sole service ace for the team. Madden also dove for two digs and provided a pair of blocks.Madden was followed by sophomore DJ White, who topped all scorers against the Ducks and had nine kills over the match. White was closely trailed by freshman outside hitter Branden Clemens and sophomore middle blocker Caleb Zimmick, who had six kills apiece. Zimmick snatched a game-high four blocks and Clemens, playing in his second-ever collegiate contest, had three.“It feels great because it feels like all the work that I put in during high school has finally started to pay off,” Clemens said. “It feels great to be part of another team and it feels great to be playing.”Clemens, who started two of the first three sets, has been the only freshman to start thus far this season.The first set saw the Crimson hold a slim lead until a 10-3 run gave the team a six-point advantage, 21-15. Despite various errors over the next several plays, a pair of kills by Madden and an attack by Clemens, all assisted by co-captain Rob Lothman, brought Harvard to game point. A botched kill by Violets freshman Keith Waddell gave the Crimson the first frame, 25-21. Waddell, an outside hitter, led his team in scoring for the day, with six kills but eight errors.Harvard jumped to an early lead in the second stanza off six NYU errors and a Clemens kill, 7-0. It was too late for the Violets, who had just six successful attacks throughout the set, and they were unable to contain the Crimson, who rolled over its opponents to take the second set, 25-13.“I felt it went a lot better,” Clemens said. “We started making a lot less errors, especially serving errors. I feel like our overall team defense and blocking went a lot better.”A final set saw a rallying effort by the NYU squad. The two teams hovered within one to two points of each other until the end of the game. A service error by White gave the Violets a point that tied the contest, 22-22. Harvard responded with a Madden kill and NYU once again set itself behind with an attack error by junior outside hitter Parker Kolodka. In a swift match point, White drilled a kill with help from senior setter Derek Jansma. Jansma set the entire third frame, handing out 13 assists. Lothman started the first two sets and finished with the match with a game-high 20 assists.“We knew they were going to come out,” Baise said. “Third set is usually the toughest because the other team is fighting to save the match. I’m glad we got it. Now that I know we won I’m glad we got a little pressure on our guys. It was 22-all. It’s always interesting to see how we respond and we were able to get those last few points.”—Staff writer Cordelia F. Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu.

You know it's January when everyone, including you, is on some quest for self-improvement. Forget about the gym for a while, however, and concentrate on 2013's new book releases. This year promises exciting novels from established writers, so reading more this year should be an easy resolution to keep.<!--more-->George Saunders, ""Tenth of December,"" January 8The genius whom you've never read is at it again with another collection of stories. The quintessential writers' writer, Saunders is still far from being a household name despite having received numerous authorial accolades. Previous publications like ""CivilWarLand in Bad Decline"" and ""In Persuasion Nation"" contained accounts of dystopian universes and exaggerated satires of contemporary society; Saunders' new work promises to be no different.Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, ""Americanah,"" May 14The award-winning Nigerian author of ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" is set to return with her first proper novel in seven years. ""Americanah"" will chronicle two star-crossed lovers, Ifemelu and Obinze, forced to flee a Nigeria full of military unrest. While Ifemelu is able to build a new life in America, Obinze is refused entry to the country; instead, he leads a dangerous life in London's underground. When the two lovers find each other back in Nigeria fifteen years later, it remains to be seen whether geographical closeness will lead to emotional reconciliation.
Khaled Hosseini, ""And the Mountains Echoed,"" May 21Remember that book called ""The Kite Runner?"" The one that found its way into every book club and high school English class in the country? Hosseini's second (and, in our opinion, far less nuanced) novel, ""A Thousand Splendid Suns,"" also made quite a splash. His third novel, ""And the Mountains Echoed,"" is due out in May; like its predecessors, it will be centered around themes of family, chronicling an intergenerational tale of sacrifice and triumph.Neil Gaiman, ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane,"" June 18Gaiman fans, rejoice: just when you thought he decided to stick with children's books, the terrifyingly prolific author is set to release a new novel aimed at adults this summer. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Ocean-End-Lane-Novel/dp/0062255657"">According to Amazon, ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane"" won't stray far from Gaiman tropes like fairies, necromancy, and the generally macabre.Thomas Pynchon, ""The Bleeding Edge,"" TBAPynchon writes doorstops of novels about esoteric subjects like the Mason-Dixon Line and Nazi rockets, but that hasn't stopped the literary world from shaking with excitement at the prospect of another one of his novels. Despite the popularity of works like ""Gravity’s Rainbow"" and ""The Crying of Lot 49,"" Pynchon has maintained his reclusive proclivities throughout his novelistic career, rarely allowing himself to be photographed or interviewed. It should come as no surprise, then, that the plot of the novel, along with its release date, remains unknown.Check out more Arts book coverage <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/tag/Books/"">here.

For the majority of the first thirteen minutes, senior goaltender Laura Bellamy stood in the net, waiting for pucks to come her way. When the seven shots on goal that Union (17-14-3, 0-9-3 ECAC) managed finally did find their way towards the nation’s leading score-stopper, Bellamy took care of business, shutting out the Dutchwomen in a 1-0 victory.The win is the sixteenth consecutive for Harvard (16-1-1, 16-0 ECAC) at the Bright Hockey Arena, a place in which the squad has not lost since January 20, 2012.Bellamy’s counterpart, Union goaltender Shenae Lundberg, had a much busier day in net as the Crimson pummeled her with five pucks in the first three minutes en route to 35 shots on goal for the contest.Although Harvard failed to convert on 34 of its scoring opportunities, Crimson defenders controlled the puck for much of the match, keeping it away from Bellamy and pushing it towards their attacking zone.“We have very solid defense and very solid defensive forwards,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “They did their job and our goalie did her job when she need to… Those are almost the hardest games to play for a goalie because you’re sitting around the whole game and then all of the sudden at the last minute they’re just peppering you.”
After a scoreless first period, Harvard came out firing to start the second, taking two shots in the first 40 seconds.  The lone goal of the game came out of a power-play opportunity, off of Dempsey’s stick.“You have to get in to those dirty areas, you have to pay the price,” coach Katey Stone said. “I think we did a better job with it and made it a little tougher on them, but you know, a good game for us to win, a good game for us to try to figure out and challenge us, and one-goal games are hairy, and you have to be able to handle the pressure, and our kids did a good job.”LUND-BELIEVABLE DEFENSEIn the earlier match-up between the Crimson and the Dutchwomen, Lundberg let six pucks escape her grasp, including two scores within five seconds of each other, causing the Union coach to bench her in the second period in favor of the second-string goaltender.Saturday was a much different story for the netminder, as she turned away puck after puck to record a 0.971 save percentage on the day, rivaling Bellamy’s top-ranked save percentage of 0.968.“Their goalie was on today, she was tremendous today,” Stone said. “That makes a huge difference with your confidence. You keep working your system when your goaltender’s making the saves she needs to make, and if that weren’t the case, they would have to be doing different things, but they were able to keep with their game plan because of how well she played.”Dempsey denied Lundberg a shutout when the Dutchwomen were outnumbered on the ice due to a boarding penalty late in the second. Off of a missed shot, the co-captain collected the rebound and put it away to give Harvard the sole point on the scoreboard.But this lead felt radically different than the one the Crimson held in the first meeting between the two teams, where Harvard gained a commanding six-point advantage by the end of the second period rather than hanging on to a one-point difference.“I have my hats off to Union and their goaltender and how well they played in front of the net,” Stone said. “They made it very, very difficult for us today, extremely frustrating. It’s one of those games where you just never know if you keep it close for too long.”A CLEAN SLATEComing in averaging 3.7 penalties a game, the only statistic in which the Crimson did not best its opponents, Harvard was looking to reduce the number of scoring opportunities it allowed Union.“We’re not a dirty team,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “We’re not going to take cheap shots at all. We really focus on keeping our sticks down and moving our feet so that they can’t call penalties on us. With that said, definitely today, they’re a team that works really hard, and when you have two teams that work as hard as we do, you’re not going to have a lot of penalties because a lot of the penalties are either cheap shots, which neither of us do.”The goal was accomplished as the Crimson incurred only one penalty during the match and killed it. Although Harvard leads the ECAC in penalty kill percentages at 96.1 percent, Stone notes the effort that her team makes to avoid man-down situations.“We’re a skating team and we’ll… do it the right way,” Stone said. “If we have to kill some penalties we will, but I think we’re doing a good job of controlling ourselves and playing good defense.”—Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samanthalin@college.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team stood head and shoulders above its competition in a three-school meet with Brown (5-2, 2-2 Ivy) and Penn (3-3, 2-3) on Saturday, winning both match-ups by its largest point spreads since last season.Competing in Providence, R.I., the Crimson (6-0, 5-0) had at least two swimmers or divers place in the top three in 11 out of the 16 events. Harvard soundly defeated the Bears, 208-92, and also topped the Quakers, 241-58.Following an eight-day training trip to Puerto Rico and a match-up against Miami last weekend, the team was not granted any rest this week but continued its conditioning push.“At this point in the season we’re pretty tired and run down,” junior captain Sara Li said. “We’re at the most intense part of our training right now, so I’m really proud of the team for really digging in and getting into the fighting spirit and racing no matter what. That was our goal for today, and I think we did a great job of that.”The Crimson was led by Li, who took home first place in three individual events and contributed to a win in the 200-yard medley relay.
Li went on to capture the title in both the 50 free and the 100 free shortly after the relay. The junior was the only Harvard swimmer to finish in the top four in each of the two races.But Li was not done yet, and she capped off her night by sailing past her competititon to win the 200 IM by nearly three seconds.“I’m happy with how I did,” Li said. “I think a big part of it is owed to the team and the team mentality. Everyone gets each other fired up, so I’m really swimming for my teammates. That’s my biggest inspiration.”Freshman Kendall Crawford was nearly as consistent as Li. Crawford was also part of the first-place 200 medley team and she swam the first leg for the 400 free relay squad that outstretched a fighting Brown team to the wall.Crawford cruised to victory in the 200 back, where she was almost six seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.The Crimson received another solid performance from freshman Danielle Lee, who took first in the 200 free. Four of the top five swimmers in the race were from Harvard.In addition to her participation on the victorious 200 medley team, Lee secured her final win of the day in the 100 back. The freshman managed to edge out teammate Crawford, who owns the Crimson all-time record in the event.Freshman Sherry Liu also stood out for Harvard, winning two races of her own. Liu’s margin of victory in the 1650 free was 18 seconds, with fellow freshmen Marlee Ehrlich and Margaret Ramsey finishing second and third, respectively.“It’s hard to even pinpoint one [freshman] because they all work together, not only in the pool but as teammates, as people,” Li said. “All of them are really positive, they have great training attitudes, and we’ve all become really close. They’ve had a really positive impact on the team.”Liu achieved similar success in the 500 free, taking first and missing her best time of the year by just a few tenths of a second.On the diving side, captain Brittany Powell racked up the most points for the Crimson, finishing first in the 1-meter and second in the 3-meter to senior Teagan Lehrmann. Harvard placed four of the top five finishers in both events.“For the diving, especially today, we haven’t been up against necessarily the best teams in the league yet,” Powell said. “So I think these have all been sort of like practice meets to try to get your dives consistent, but [our next meet] is going to be the real test of our mental acuity and our precision.”The Crimson’s focus has been pinpointed on the match-up with Yale and Princeton, which will begin on Feb. 1. The competition features some of the best swimmers and divers in the Ivy League, and Harvard snapped Princeton’s 43-meet win streak last year.“This is definitely the best preparation we can have, with two meets in one weekend,” Powell said. “HYP is a two-day meet, and [this weekend] prepares you mentally because if you had a tough day on the first day, or even if you had a great day, you need to forget about it and move on to your next races or your next day of diving. It’s going to be a dogfight and we’re going to have to fight for every single event.”—Staff writer David Steinbach can be reached at dsteinbach@college.harvard.edu.

In 2013, you will probably have a lot of questions about love. These should be five of them:1. If Ivy Leaguers are refuting <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/fashion/the-end-of-courtship.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;"">The End of Courtship, are they endorsing The End of Empircal Reasoning? 2. Which came first: The End of Courtship, or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/End-Men-Rise-Women/dp/1594488045/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358746033&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+end+of+men"">The End of Men? 3. Was The End of Men before <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-End-Sex-Generation-Unfulfilled/dp/0465002153/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358746006&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+end+of+sex+how+hookup+culture+is+leaving+a+generation+unhappy"">The End of Sex? 4. Would you rather <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/29/sex-harvard-morality/"">The End of Sex With Men before Courtship, or <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/boys-on-the-side/309062/?single_page=true"">The End of Courtship with Men before Sex? 
 5. Is it a coincidence that, as we are battered with The Ends of Everything Sexy, we can turn manically and trustingly to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/series/arts/article/2013/1/13/girls-season-two-premiere/"">The Beginning of Second Season of ""Girls""?   <!--more-->Well, the last one's a no, according to The New York Times in a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/fashion/the-end-of-courtship.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;"">recent article entitled ""The End of Courtship."" The article—which is hilarious, by the way—asserts that ""hanging out"" is the new dating, and that female urban straight 20-somethings who work in media or PR (it doesn't really talk about anyone else) are dissatisfied with their male non-suitors. ""For evidence, look no further than 'Girls,' HBO's cultural weathervane for urban 20-somethings,"" writes Alex Williams, ""where none of the main characters paired off in a manner that might count as courtship even a decade ago."" Luckily for y'all, newly released statistics say that the answer to the first question on the list is also negative. Even if you are watching 'Girls'—and you <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/series/arts/article/2013/1/13/girls-season-two-premiere/#jump"">should be—you're probably still dating, which is, um, kind of weird, because we at Flyby know more students who are engaged or married than properly dating.According to the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/10/harvard-students-hot-not/"">ever-amusing college dating site <a href=""https://datemyschool.com/"">DateMySchool, however, even in 2013, 54% of Ivy Leaguers say their ideal first date is still a dinner date. (Also according to DateMySchool, if the straight men going on these possibly imaginary dinner dates take physical attractiveness as a primary criterion in their selection of a date-mate, a majority of them would like those first date dinner dates to be <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/10/harvard-students-hot-not/"">with girls from BC.) And 74% of those Ivy League guys would want to cover the bill, even though 68% of Ivy broads are down to split it. If these ideals and conditionals are confusing you, don't worry, they're confusing us too. But we checked, and according to the 2012 Senior Survey, 63.8% of graduating Harvard seniors <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/25/graduates-senior-survey-2012/"">had dated one or more persons.So we just have to ask: WHERE ARE YOU PEOPLE? Maybe you're all just in secret relationships that are non-relationships, and since, according to DateMySchool, 96% of you would still prefer to end a relationship in person, rather than through text or setting a Facebook relationship status to ""single,"" the world—and the person you were in a non-relationship that was actually a relationship with—will never know.There's also a chance that the survey's ""Ivy Leaguers"" don't translate to ""Harvard students"" at all. Perhaps the statistics indicate that it's one of our seven siblings who's going steady.Our bets are on Yale. Sure, two years ago dating for Elis may have been a ""<a href=""http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2010/02/12/elis-say-going-steady-can-be-rocky/"">Sisyphean feat,"" but now that they have the good fortune to <a href=""http://yaledailynews.com/weekend/2012/01/20/just-say-no-to-awful-sex/"">say no to bad sex, maybe they're also saying yes to dinner. After all, if H-Y memories prove faithful, New Haven has at least two good sit-down pizza places and may have also invented the hamburger, right?

After single-handedly introducing jazz to Harvard's campus more than four decades ago and fostering innovative student musicianship through his 42 years of service, Thomas G. Everett will retire on Feb. 15 from his post as Director of Harvard Bands.“He is basically the reason there was jazz here at Harvard for as long as it has been,” said African-American Music professor Ingrid T. Monson. “It’s hard to imagine Harvard jazz without him.”Everett arrived at Harvard in 1971 to manage the student-run Harvard University Band, which performs at Harvard athletic contests and University events. At the time, the campus musical scene he encountered was dominated by Western classical music, according to Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts.Jazz, Everett immediately noticed, was strangely absent from campus.“The department of music at Harvard was renowned for developing composers, musicologists, and theorists, but had not embraced more music of the people, music with social connotations, in the sense of popular American music and jazz,” Everett said. “I just felt that this was significant music—how could an educated person from one of the greatest institutions in the world graduate without some exposure?”
In an effort to fill the gap, Everett founded the Harvard Jazz Bands and began teaching Harvard’s first jazz course for academic credit through the Extension School. The course, called “The Jazz Tradition,” was later moved to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.Everett also pioneered the Jazz Masters in Residence program, which brought a famous jazz musician to campus each semester to direct and collaborate with students. In the past, jazz masters in residence have included Maxwell “Max” Roach, Eddie Palmieri, and Benny Golson.“I think he changed the culture of music at Harvard in some respects,” Megan said. “Bringing these great jazz musicians to Harvard was an enormous influence for our students and a signal that Harvard is interested in jazz. He made a lot of students feel that they ought to be playing jazz [and] made faculty think that it ought to be part of the curriculum.”To Everett, playing music with a jazz great was an invaluable step in one’s musical education—an experience he likened to studying science with Isaac Newton. After playing alongside these musicians, he said, students feel that “they aren’t this imaginary sound, they’re a real person.”Andrew S. Kennard ’13, student manager of the Harvard Monday Jazz Band, said Everett’s immense knowledge and appreciation of specific composers and pieces enhances the quality of sound he can elicit from his students.“When you know something about the music, it gives you a more mature position from which to play the music,” Kennard said. “It’s so easy to just play the notes, but Tom really helps you to understand what’s going on behind the notes.”Over the years, Everett has commissioned a number of works from famous artists especially for performances by Harvard’s jazz bands, choosing both well-known pieces and more obscure works that would otherwise remain unknown to students. The practice, Kennard said, encourages student musicians to learn from a diverse range of talents and has made him “more courageous as a music listener.”“It’s always, ‘How can we make the music sound better, how can we play the music respectfully and still have our own take on it?’” Kennard said. “One thing that I appreciate about Tom is his lack of ego in this job even after 40 years.”Megan echoed Kennard’s sentiment, adding that Everett’s manner of directing is symbolic of the way that a good jazz band works, with a regimented percussion section that still allows other sections to experiment and improvise.“My sense is that he’s very precise with his students about what he wants, and at the same time he recognizes that in playing jazz, there needs to be room to breathe,” Megan said.

A 20-point lead was not enough for Memphis. An increasingly rowdy crowd of 16,204 couldn’t do the trick either. But a fourth foul on freshman point guard Siyani Chambers? That was all it took to finish off the Crimson, as the Tigers dealt their visitors a 60-50 defeat.With just under six minutes left at the FedEx Forum, the Harvard men’s basketball team was on a roll. After trailing, 36-16, earlier in the half, the Crimson rallied to knot the game at 48. During that stretch, Chambers registered five assists and knocked down two jumpers of his own, contributing directly to nearly half of his squad’s points during the run and facilitating numerous other baskets by beating pressure and finding open teammates.After getting Harvard back into a game it seemed to have lost in the first half, Chambers was not allowed to finish the job. On Memphis’ first possession after sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi tied the game at 48, Chambers was called for a foul for being too physical with the ball-handler, his fourth of the contest. Worried that his point guard would foul out of the game, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker was forced to take Chambers out of the game.“I was disappointed when he got that fourth,” Amaker said. “He’s got to be a little better, more disciplined, not to pick up that fourth, but as fate would have it, it happened, so we tried to get him out.”If the freshman’s value to the team hadn’t been clear during the comeback, it became evident over the next three minutes. In his first three possessions as the team’s primary ball-handler, sophomore Wesley Saunders missed a tough shot and committed two turnovers. The Tigers took advantage of those mistakes with two fast-break buckets to open up a four-point lead.
With just over two minutes left, Amaker put Chambers back in the game. The magic was gone though, and the rookie didn’t have enough time to lead his team on another comeback, as Memphis pulled away for what would be a 10-point victory.“I was trying to save him, but we were not very good when we don’t have him on the floor,” Amaker said. “We knew if we didn’t have him on the floor it was going to be hard for us to run offense and handle the ball against their pressure.”BIG MEN ON CAMPUSThe challenges Harvard faced Saturday were clear before the game even started. During the team introductions, the Crimson couldn’t ignore the size deficit they were going to face when they stepped on the court. Five Tigers loomed taller than 6’8,” and Memphis featured three players weighing in at 240 pounds or heavier. On the other side, no Harvard starter is listed at taller than 6’6,” and sophomore Jonah Travis was the heaviest in the starting five, listed at 225.The size difference played out visibly on the glass, where the Tigers brought down 14 offensive rebounds and tallied 17 second-chance points. Many of those points came on put-back dunks that electrified the team and its fans.“They were just tremendous at climbing the backboard and having second-chance opportunities,” Amaker said. “We could never consistently keep them off the backboard. The kid [D.J.] Stephens is an incredible athlete and his tip-dunk plays I thought were momentum plays, energy plays, for his team.”Meanwhile, the Crimson only grabbed two offensive boards and had four second-chance points in the contest.Memphis also used its size to alter Harvard’s shots down low, blocking eight shots and forcing the Crimson into tougher shots the rest of the time. The Crimson had trouble adjusting to the Tigers’ size, which lead to its early shooting woes. Harvard was more successful in the second half, but, in the end, they couldn’t generate enough good offensive looks against Memphis’ defense.BACK TO THE IVIESAfter getting a taste of big-time college ball, the Crimson will now head back to Ivy play for the duration of the season. The experience of playing a talent-laden team in front of a big-time crowd will prove invaluable, even if Harvard can’t boast the road upset on its resume come March.“I think [this game] will help us a lot,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “We’re not going to see a team like Memphis in our league. Just playing this caliber team and going back to play the Dartmouth’s and Penn’s…we’ll fare a lot better.”Memphis coach Josh Pastner also said that the Crimson will see success in the Ancient Eight.“Harvard’s good,” Pastner said. “They are very, very well coached. They’ve got good players. They are going to win the Ivy League. I think they will win it by a landslide. Not to put pressure on them but there is no question about it: They are good.”—Staff writer Jacob D. H. Feldman can be reached at jacobfeldman@college.harvard.edu.

Following their first loss of the season, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team (10-1, 2-1 Ivy) was able to rebound at the Pioneer Round Robin Tournament in Amherst and take down the No. 13 University of Western Ontario (11-3) and No. 23 Amherst College (5-7) on Saturday.HARVARD 9, AMHERST 0In its second match of the day, Harvard defeated Amherst, 9-0. Coach Mike Way gave reigning national champion junior Ali Farag a rest against Amherst, sliding line two player junior Brandon McLaughlin and line three player junior Gary Power up a slot.McLaughlin defeated Amherst’s No. 1, Noah Browne, in straight sets, and only gave up 12 points. Power similarly won without dropping a set, defeating David Kerr 11-7, 11-8, 11-7. Harvard took the first seven lines without dropping a set, the closest set being an 11-9 third set victory by freshman Matt Roberts. Roberts played in the No. 9 position in the earlier match against Western Ontario but played line four against Amherst as five of the top nine Crimson players sat the afternoon match.“The JV has had less experience so there is usually a little more nervous energy,” Way said. “The seasoned varsity athletes have grown up in the juniors and they have played tons and tons of matches so the JV tends to get a little more anxious.”
At the bottom of the lineup, freshman Jake Matthews won a five-set match over Amherst’s Rodrigo Quan in the eighth spot and freshman Peter Janulis came back after losing the first set, 11-7, to Kelvin Chen, and won the next three sets. Matthews won the first set, 11-7, before dropping the second, 10-12. He recovered to win the third, and dropped the fourth before taking the final set 11-5.“I try to block out outside thoughts and focus on the only two teams and take it from there,” Matthews said. “[I] see how the game develops and work from there.”Way said that the team has developed well over the course of the season and has bought in to the philosophies of the coaching staff and the direction that they are looking for the team to take in a year where the team has national championship aspirations.“I just think that we have a happy squad,” Way said. “To have a happy athlete means that he likes the coaching and the program and it makes sense. Then they begin to understand what we are about as coaches, how we are trying to direct them, and what we are trying to do with their game. They understand we believe in them but some young athletes at places like Harvard are opinionated and sometimes you need maturity so that they see the bigger picture in their own individual development and the direction that the coaches want to take the team.”HARVARD 8, WESTERN ONTARIO 1On the heels of a disappointing show at Princeton that saw the Crimson fall to the Tigers, 5-4, redemption was a theme for many players.“Some of the players had to redeem themselves,” Way said. “There wasn’t much to be said. The guys that didn’t perform at Princeton knew exactly who they were and this week was a terrific practice week for us.”During the day opener, Harvard players blanked their Mustang opponents in five of the nine matches. Playing at his usual No. 1 position, Farag played a close first game against Albert Shoihet, 11-9, but responded by taking the next two, 11-5 and 11-6, respectively.Additional straight-set victories came from No. 2 McLaughlin, No. 3 Power, No. 5 junior Nigel Koh, and No. 7 senior Zeke Scherl.Sophomore Tyler Olson, playing at the No. 4 spot, was the only Crimson player to fall during the day. Olson was edged by Western Ontario’s Yeshale Chetty in four sets, 3-1. Each game was decided by just a two point margin.No. 8 senior Jason Michas and No. 9 freshman Matt Roberts both fought through five games to defeat their respective foes. Roberts won the first game, 12-10, before dropping the next two, 9-11, and finally staging a comeback in which he beat Kale Wilson, 11-5 and 11-6, in the final two games.Michas beat Adam Engel in a thriller during which the third and fourth sets saw each player lose 11-3. In the final game, the two players grappled for a win and Michas prevailed, 19-17.“The standout has been Jason Michas, who won 19-17 in his final set,” Way said. “With a bad back and a sore knee... the win was actually critical because at that juncture we had a bunch of matches tied up. At that moment the chips were down and he led from the front as a captain.”

The Harvard skiing team improved on an 11th place finish at the Vermont Carnival on Jan. 12 at the St. Lawrence Carnival at Whiteface and Mount von Hovenberg in Lake Placid, N.Y., racing to finish ninth out of a field of 16 on Saturday.The Crimson accrued 314.5 points, sitting behind host St. Lawrence University’s 445.0 points and ahead of St. Michael’s College and its 219.5 points. The top three teams at the Carnival were the University of Vermont, with 1013 points, Dartmouth College, with 788 points, and the University of New Hampshire, with 748.5 points.“The college races start two weeks later than they did this year and so some of the other programs like UVM get in a lot more skiing than we do early in the season,” Harvard coach Tim Mitchell said. “They had a bit more of an advantage than normal coming into these first collegiate races. We’re right on track right now.”Harvard saw its highest finishes in the women’s Giant Slalom, where the team was seventh out of 14, and men’s cross-country, where they registered a fourth place finish in the 20k FS event.Junior Rebecca Nadler was fourth in the Giant Slalom with a combined time of 2:03.93 over her two runs, just .0052 behind the overall winner, Kate Ryley of Vermont. Nadler finished her second run only .001 slower than Ryley.
“That was a pretty good finish, a step in the right direction from last week,” Mitchell said. “All of the women that finished in front of her are currently on or recently were on their respective national teams. Being behind one current Canadian national team athlete, one former Canadian national team athlete and one former Norwegian national team athlete is not too bad.”Nadler was followed by teammates senior Catherine Sheils, who posted a 31st place finish, sophomore Liz Strong, who was 43rd, and freshman Samantha Udolf, who rounded out the group in 49th.“We’ve all been trying to translate the things we are working on in practice onto the race hill,” Udolf said. “As a result of those efforts, the girls put down solid runs at Whiteface.”The Crimson squad also competed in the Slalom event, where Nadler notched a 10th place finish.“I definitely felt better about my results this week than last week,” Nadler said. “I think I can still do better but it was definitely a much stronger week for me.”The Nordic team had top-15 finishes in both of the men’s events. Sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci raced to 14th place out of 87 entrants in the 3k Prologue FS with a time of 8:13.2 During the 20k FS, senior Anthony Ryerson, who was 35th in the 3k event, finished the course in 50:17, placing him 15th out of the 84 competitors. Ryerson was closely trailed by Maifeld-Caurcci who netted 18th place and a time of 50:32.Freshman Annie Harvieux was the Crimson’s top finisher in both women’s cross-country events. Harvieux began with a time of 45:15.5 in the 15k FS event to place her 29th out of 85 skiiers. On the second day of the Carnival, she placed 42nd in the field with a time of 10:07.1 in the 3k Prologue FS. Harvieux was followed by junior Jen Rolfes and senior Alena Tofte. Rolfes was just one second behind her teammate and finished in 45th, just edging 48th-place Tofte by .004 seconds.The men of the Alpine team also saw race time. While freshman Matthew Mansson did not finish the Giant Slalom event, he did compete in the Slalom event, finishing in 40th place with a time of 1:30.61.“It was really tough for the guys right now,” Mitchell said. “The course conditions were actually very good and you’d think that would make it easy for them to move up. Unfortunately because the snow conditions were very good and the course set was not overly difficult, a lot of people put down very solid, clean, fast runs. When you’re back in the high 80s or low 90s, you have to beat a third of the field to even qualify for the second run.”-- Staff writer Cordelia F.

Coming off strong wins in dual meets against Brown and Penn the day before, the Harvard women’s swimming team easily handled non-conference foe Vermont in a Sunday showdown at Blodgett Pool. It was Senior Night, and the members of the Class of 2013 hit the pool for the last dual meet of their Crimson careers.“We were all pretty tired,” freshman Kendall Crawford said. “We had a big meet on Saturday and have been training really, really hard, especially since we got back from Puerto Rico. But since it was also the senior meet, there was a lot of excitement… We wanted to make that day special for the seniors.”After winning 15 of the 16 events on the day, Harvard came away with a dominant 232-68 victory over the Catamounts. The Crimson swept the podium in nine of the day’s events.“I don’t think anyone was really intimidated by Vermont,” co-captain Brittany Powell said. “[They’re] a Division II team, so they’re not as competitive as our own league. Instead of focusing on the competition, we focused on ourselves and our own performances.”In their last dual meet at Blodgett Pool, a quartet of seniors kicked off Harvard’s routing of Vermont with a first place finish in the first event of the day. Seniors Caroline Weaver, Mackenzie Luick, Ellie Johnson, and Carol Lin placed first in the women’s 200 medley relay with a time of 1:48.14. The Crimson swept the podium in the event, with a group of four sophomores coming in second and the freshmen team swimming to a strong third-place showing.
In the next event, freshmen Oriana Wang and Connie Hsu went 1-2 in the 1000 freestyle. With a time of 10:24.77, Wang narrowly edged out her classmate, who finished less than a second behind with a time of 10:26.39. Fellow first-year Daniela Suarez-Rebling finished in fourth in 10:32.38.Junior co-captain Sara Li followed suit and put up another win for Harvard in the 200 freestyle. Li later posted a close second-place finish in the 200 breaststroke. The junior finished 0.2 seconds behind sophomore Faith Martin in the event, who won with a time of 2:23.06. Martin also picked up a victory in the 100 backstroke with a time of 57.59.Freshman Kendall Crawford had a pair of strong showings, winning both of her individual events of the meet. Crawford started out with a win in the 50 freestyle with a time of 24.07, then had a short one-event break before hitting the pool again for the 100 freestyle.“I love watching the diving,” Crawford said. “Getting sandwiched between the diving [event] gave me a little break to just collect my thoughts, cool down, and get ready for the next race.”Powell capped her Crimson career with strong showings in both of her diving events. The senior took third in the three meter, behind sophomore Amanda Largent and fellow senior Teagan Lehrmann. Then, in her final dual meet dive at Blodgett, Powell won the one meter. Freshman Emily Bonfig and Lehrmann took second and third, respectively.“It was very emotional for the seven of us seniors,” Powell said. “We had done all of the ceremonial things, so I felt a little shaky on the three meter. By the time we were on one meter, my nerves were gone, and I probably had one of the best one meter performances of my career.”Harvard currently stands undefeated in this season’s dual meets, having won their first six events of the season. The Crimson have a two week break before resuming action in their final dual meets of the year against Ivy foes Yale and Princeton.“Being on the team for four years, I don’t think there’s ever been a team more focused on this last meet [against Yale and Princeton],” Powell said. “We are just so ready. I’m feeling great about the team’s mentality right now.”Having completed most of its regular season schedule, Harvard is beginning to look down the line towards championship season, where the team will look to defend its Ivy League title and improve upon its second place finish at the ECAC Championship.“We’ve been on a warpath all year for ‘operation repeat,’ to win Ivy’s again, and also to win ECAC’s,” Crawford said. “We want to win two championships in one weekend, and that’s been the goal all season. The way we’ve been training all year, we definitely have a great, great shot.”—Staff writer Brenna R. Nelsen can be reached at brennanelsen@college.harvard.edu.

For the fifth straight year, the Harvard women’s tennis team (1-0) won its season opener. The team defeated the Cleveland State Vikings (0-1), 7-0, sweeping every match played. The Crimson came into the match with a preseason ranking of 74, a couple spots behind Ivy League rivals Columbia (no. 73) and Princeton (no. 71).Harvard won every singles match except for one in straight sets, with freshman Hai-Le Kong surrendering a quick first set, 6-3, before taking the next set, 6-1, and the tiebreaker, 10-2. In other singles matches, freshmen Amanda Lin and Crystal Yen dropped only one game between them in dispatching Cleveland State players Ellen Folkers and Mengdi Liu.“I think the team competed very well for their first match of the season,” coach Traci Green said. “I’m really impressed with their effort and proud of the freshmen with the way they hung in there during some shaky games.The Crimson started quickly as co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amy He jumped out to a quick 8-1 doubles victory. Norton and He broke twice to open the match and quickly went up 5-0 before their opponents saw a game point. After saving two break points at 5-1, Norton and He lost two points in the next three games. Co-captain Hideko Tachibana and freshman Amanda Lin won their match, 8-3, to clinch the doubles point for Harvard.“The freshmen have been gaining a lot of experience in doubles over the last few months,” Green said. “Junior tennis is a lot different than the college game and they’ve improved a lot over the last couple months. The main area of improvement has been the mental side. They are a lot more composed out there and that has given them a lot of confidence.”
Playing lines one and two for the Crimson, Tachibana and Norton struggled out of the gate. Tachibana was broken in the first game of her match; Norton lost serve in her second. After breaking back, Tachibana was broken again before running off a streak of 9 straight games. Using low slices and high topspin to keep her opponent off balance, Tachibana’s game elicited audible sounds of frustration from opponent Alex Power in a 6-2, 6-1 victory.Norton broke back in the fifth game of the set and again in the seventh to take a lead at 4-3. Punctuating the second break with a fist pump and a loud “Come on”, Norton served out the set to take the first 6-4. In the second set, down another break early, Norton ran off five consecutive games to end the match with a 6-3 second set victory.“Norton is definitely the vocal leader on this team,” Green said. “It’s only been one match but [I can tell] this team has a lot of heart and they’ve been very dedicated to improvement. We are a bit rusty but I liked the way that we were competing out there and I liked the way that we showed effort and determination.”After playing the Harvard Fall Invitation in November, the team had more than two months off before starting the spring season. In the fall, the team competes as individuals—entering players in draws but not moving forward through the tournaments as a team. In the spring, the format changes and every member of the team competes together“I think that today they had a lot of energy, a lot of focus, and they played as a team,” assistant coach Debbie Goldfine said. “With tennis players, that can be different. The team was focused on their own matches but they also had an eye out for others and even the people that were not on the court were very focused on what was happening and were very engaged. They worked a lot on match play and point play [over the break] and I think that made a difference today.—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

It was a bittersweet afternoon for the Harvard wrestling team when it welcomed Rutgers to the Malkin Athletic Center Sunday.Co-captain Walter Peppelman stood out as he became just the seventh Crimson wrestler to reach 100 collegiate wins in a dramatic overtime victory, but Peppelman’s individual triumph could not carry Harvard (2-4, 0-3 EIWA). The Scarlet Knights (12-2, 5-0 EIWA) swept seven of the ten weight classes and beat the Crimson, 26-9.Coming off a 24-15 loss to Cornell on Saturday in which Harvard remained in contention for most of the afternoon, the Crimson struggled to contain the Red Knights’ after they dominated three of the first four weight classes.“I thought that [the performance against Cornell] could be a big springboard, quite honestly,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Coming into Sunday’s match with Rutgers, I knew they were tough, and we actually didn’t match up well with them.”The Crimson started off the day with a strong performance by Peppelman—who is ranked eighth at 157 pounds—who fought back from a first-period deficit against No. 17 Scott Winston to send the match into a sudden victory period.
The two were evenly matched at the start of the one-minute overtime, but Peppelman seized control after 50 seconds and took the victory, 4-2, ensuring himself a spot in the Harvard record books.“Walter’s been a great leader and a tremendous teammate and competitor,” said co-captain Steven Keith. “I don’t think a lot of people realize how great it is. One hundred matches is a lot in college wrestling, and he deserves every win that he got.”Keith—ranked 10th in the 141-pound weight class—did not fare as well as his co-captain. In his third pin of the season, Rutgers’ Trevor Melde picked up the win by fall at the 2:56 mark.“I ended up taking a couple nice shots in the first period but got into a scramble,” Keith said. “The kid from Rutgers is real tough. He’s been around for a while, so he was able to catch me on my back and pin me. He’s good, but I know if I see him again, I have a good shot to change what happened.”Despite picking up the first win of the afternoon from Peppelman, Harvard was unable to generate momentum. Rutgers picked up consecutive wins in the 165, 174, and 184-pound weight classes as freshman Devon Gobbo, junior Cameron Croy, and sophomore Josh Popple fell to their Scarlet Knight opponents.The Crimson snapped Rutgers’ winning streak in the 197-pound weight class after sophomore James Fox dominated Scarlet Knight Hayden Hrymack with takedowns early in the match. Harvard couldn’t hold on to pick up two in a row when heavyweight freshman <a href=""http://gocrimson.com/sports/wrest/2012-13/bios/gajdzik%20nicholas%20h4az"">Nicholas Gajdzik tied up the score at one in the third period to send the match into tiebreakers but was ultimately defeated by Rutgers’ Billy Smith.“Saturday night we won the close bouts, and Sunday we lost the close bouts,” Weiss said. “There were three close bouts that we lost on Sunday that if they go the other way it’s a different game. That’s the sport of wrestling. You’ve got to win the close bouts.”After the close heavyweight match, the Scarlet Knights continued to pick up wins, sweeping the next three weight classes before Rutgers’ Ken Theobold dropped the last match to Harvard freshman Todd Preston in the 149-pound weight class.Competing in back-to-back matchups on Saturday and Sunday, Weiss said that fatigue was not a factor against Rutgers.“That’s the nature of our sport,” Weiss said. “Obviously that’s not easy, but it’s no excuse.”In addition to Peppelman, Scarlet Knight Dan Rinaldi also picked up his 100th collegiate victory in an 18-5 downing of Popple in the 184-pound weight class. Despite his team suffering two consecutive losses this weekend and dropping four of its last five—with the sole win coming against Stanford two weeks ago—Keith said he was optimistic about the remainder of the season.“We wrestled pretty well as a team,” Keith said. “Obviously we lost, but I saw some good things from a bunch of different guys. Some of the mistakes that were made are easy to fix, so I think we’ll be fine for the rest of the season.”

Facing its fourth consecutive ranked opponent and playing on national television for the second time in three games, the Harvard men’s hockey team failed to generate anything offensively and fell to No. 12 Yale, 4-0.Friday night's shutout at Ingalls Rink marked the third straight win for the Bulldogs (10-4-1, 6-3-1 ECAC), while the Crimson (5-9-1, 3-7-0 ECAC) lost for the sixth time in its last seven contests.“By and large Yale was quicker, faster, had much more poise and executed offensively a lot better than we did,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.Yale maintained consistent pressure throughout the night on Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard—outshooting Harvard 39-21—while the Bulldog defense shut down the Crimson power play, denying five Harvard man-up chances.That statistic marked a continuation of a season’s worth of struggles for the Crimson power play, which was second best in the nation a year ago but has been successful just 10.9 percent of the time this season—dead last in the ECAC by a wide margin.
On Friday, the teams combined for three penalties in the game’s first five minutes, but it was in five-on-five play that Yale was able to get on the board midway through the opening period.Junior Kenny Agostino—who had two goals in the Bulldogs’ 5-1 win over Harvard on Nov. 3—fired a shot from the middle slot that deflected off of Girard’s pad to the left of the crease. Yale captain Andrew Miller collected the rebound and sent the puck into an open net for the game’s first score.“We just weren’t ready out of the gate, right off the bat to get it going,” freshman forward Brian Hart said.Later in the frame, the Bulldogs were able to augment their pressure on Girard. After the junior made saves on shots by Jesse Root and Trent Ruffolo, the third time proved to be the charm for Yale when senior Antoine Langiere pushed the puck out of a crowd and to the far post for his 11th goal of the year.At the 6:53 mark of the second period, the Bulldogs extended their lead to 3-0 when Ruffolo put home a goal from the low slot following a Girard save of a Ryan Obuchowski attempt.“We established a physical play from the beginning and wore their defense down,” Ruffolo said. “It forced them to create turnovers, and that’s what led to our scoring chances.”As the frame went on, freshman Jimmy Vesey could not finish on a good look off a pass from Hart and two Yale shots deflected off the pipe. In the final two minutes of the period, the Bulldogs denied a Crimson five-on-three opportunity by clearing the puck thrice.“They could have [scored] two [goals] there, and then [it would have been] a different game,” Yale coach Keith Allain said.The Bulldogs were able to get on the board once again just fifty seconds into the final frame when Ruffolo put home a one-timer off a pass from Root for his second score of the contest.“Yale’s a fast team,” Hart said. “They play with a lot of speed in their transition game. They were all over us.”

Halfway through sophomore Denis Nguyen’s singles match against Boston College’s Johnathan Raude, the Eagles’ No. 1 singles player hit a ball just long that won the game for Nguyen.“Whoa, out?” said Raude, approaching the net. “There’s no way that was out.”Unfazed, Nguyen responded, “Way out….If it was in, I would’ve run it down.”This calm confidence carried the Harvard men’s tennis team through the weekend as the Crimson kicked off its spring season by hosting Marist and local foe Boston College in the Harvard Winter Invite.The No. 28 Crimson started off the season in strong fashion with resounding victories throughout the weekend. The Eagles and Red Foxes didn’t have an answer for Harvard as the home squad won eight of its nine doubles matches and 18 of its 20 singles matches.
Several times throughout the weekend, the visitors’ frustration was evident in their body language, yells, and exclamations after missed opportunities.“I think they came here trying to prove something,” Nguyen said. “We were high-ranking last year, so I guess they were trying their best to beat us which was good because it brought out the best competition in us. I just think our players were a little bit more confident going in to it.”Play for the Crimson was strong across the board, with five of Harvard’s eight players winning all of their singles and doubles matches over the tournament.“I think everyone on our team did really well in both singles and doubles,” Chaudhuri said, “It’s hard to pinpoint individuals but overall everyone played great.”Denis Nguyen continued his impressive play from the fall season and helped solidify his first singles position with three wins over the weekend, including a 6-4, 6-0 win over teammate Shaun Chaudhuri to win the title on Sunday.“The top guys played really well,” freshman Conor Haughey said. “Especially Denis and Shaun, who played each other in the finals. They played really well.”Chaudhuri had a similarly notable weekend, beating out Boston College’s Johnathan Raude, 6-1, 6-1 and Phillip Nelson, 6-2, 6-1 before losing to teammate Nguyen. Chaudhuri used exact ball placement and shot selection to overwhelm his Eagles opponents. Playing doubles with freshman Nicky Hu, the tandem beat Boston College’s Nelson and Michael McGinnis, 8-2, on Friday and Marist’s Trym Nagelstad and Will Reznek, 8-4, on Saturday.Sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Nicholas Mahlangu won the doubles title of the invite, with an 8-5 win over teammates Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster on Saturday. They had beaten the Eagles’ Johnathan Raude and Matt Wagner, 8-2, earlier in the day to set up the match-up against their teammates.“Everyone from top to bottom showed up in practice ready to compete,” Chaudhuri said. “They performed really well in both singles and doubles.”Hu and MacMaster, playing fourth and fifth singles, respectively, won every match that they played this weekend against opponents from Boston College and the Red Foxes. MacMaster did not drop a single set.

His opponent’s legs scissoring around his neck, senior Walter Peppelman found a last reservoir of strength, pushing upward to lift his Rutgers opponent into the air before turning the tables and pinning him to the mat. Peppelman’s victory in sudden-victory overtime was his 100th as a Harvard wrestler, making him only the seventh wrestler in Crimson history to accomplish such a feat.“It was a hard-fought overtime victory so I was pleased with that,” Peppelman said. “It’s great to be part of a program that’s so special and to reach this milestone. It was a really nice accomplishment.”Peppelman said that at the beginning of the year, he listed two goals for himself—win every match and win the national championship. He described the victory as a “pit stop” along the way but his focus is on winning the national title, which is decided in March.Junior Erik Gobbo said that Peppelman is an inspirational leader who leads the team with the standards he sets. Gobbo said that Peppelman will identify teammates who are having a bad day and go out of his way to pick them up.“He’s a great leader and an inspirational wrestler,” Gobbo said. “It’s just incredible. He’s one of the hardest workers in a room. He’s a great person to be a role model and he leads by example.”
Gobbo sees Peppelman—who has been a captain for the last three years—as an exemplification of the two traits that the team aims to emulate.“When I was a freshman, we did something where we picked two words to describe the team,” Gobbo said. “The words were discipline and integrity and those are two things that he has stressed for our team and he is a great example of those and a great leader for our squad.”One year in, Peppelman’s career at Harvard reached a low note. The Harrisburg, Pennsylvania native came to Harvard as a prized recruit and impressed on his first year of the team. However, before he could begin his second season, he suffered a partially-torn elbow ligament that would take him until the end of the season to rehab.Instead of staying on campus, Peppelman withdrew from school for a year to maintain athletic eligibility due to the eight-semester limit Harvard enforces. When he had time off, the wrestler served as an assistant coach at his old high school—coaching younger brother Marshall, now wrestling at Cornell, and the rest of the team to a state title.After the season ended, Peppelman was able to work in the office of his local state senator and travel to Russia to train. When he returned to campus, he competed in a different weight class and was named co-captain of the team as a sophomore.Peppelman’s career falls ranks third in Harvard history and his 33 single-season wins last year is eighth all-time. Last year, he earned All-American status and finished eighth at the NCAA championships, honors identical to those earned in his sophomore year. Peppelman finished second at the EWA championships as a junior and recorded a win over the No. 3 wrestler in the nation en route to the final. Now a senior, Peppleman is ranked eighth in the nation and can reflect on his Crimson career.“I’ve been in the program for five years and my big goal was to leave the team better than I found it,” Peppelman said. “One of the best ways that I’ve tried to do that is to give everyone on the team the power to lead and the power to influence on the team. It’s been showing up recently with people doing well and saying the right things both on and off the mat. Hopefully at the end of the season I’ll leave the team with twenty leaders ready to move forward.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

No recent event in American foreign policy has captured the public imagination like the killing of Osama bin Laden, and Kathryn Bigelow's slick, technically brilliant film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is surely only the first in what will be many retellings of that story. It's no Hollywood hagiography—the plot is admirably devoid of cliché and the eventual success of the mission is shown in a mature and restrained fashion, in stark contrast to the wild celebrations with which it was greeted in reality. However, one problematic feature of the narrative has sparked massive amounts of controversy—the movie's depiction of torture.<!--more-->Leaving aside completely its moral reprehensibility, it is now <a href=""http://www.international.ucla.edu/burkle/news/article.asp?parentid=129525"">widely accepted by many in the federal government that torture—including so-called ""advanced interrogation techniques"" such as sensory deprivation and waterboarding—does not provide accurate intelligence. Despite this, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" shows a crucial piece of intelligence, the identity of bin Laden's courier, being obtained only after a subject is beaten, starved, shackled to the ceiling, imprisoned in a tiny box, waterboarded, and sexually humiliated.Later detainees are shown being sensorially deprived and struck in the face until they confirm the intelligence. One agrees to give up his information because, he says, ""I have no desire to be tortured again."" When one character bemoans the cessation of the detainee program because it would have been able to confirm bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, nobody contradicts her. Doubtless though it is that part of the filmmakers' mission here to confront the full horrors of American-sponsored interrogation and rendition, the depiction of torture in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" does seem to deviate from the now commonly accepted narrative.Plenty of ink has been spilled on this subject in a wider political sense, but what implications does it have for the artistic unity of the movie itself? Ms. Bigelow and the movie's screenwriter, Mark Boal, have been talking up the journalistic qualities of the film and their efforts to make it as true to life as possible—the oft-abused term ""docudrama"" has been bandied around.  There's nothing wrong with that, and for the most part they succeed. However, the aforementioned discrepancy threatens to compromise their artistic integrity and the veracity of the events they depict.One could argue that the torture component of the narrative is excusable because ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is, at the end of the day, only a film, and thus able to use poetic license. Fair enough, but this would appear to upset the film's claim to journalistic accuracy. In the movie, then, what is actually true-to-life? How do we, as viewers, know? If cinema ever makes the bold claim that it resembles real historical documentation, then it had better be prepared to be critiqued as such.

Walter Peppelman earned his 100th career win in the wrestling match against Rutgers, helping the co-captain garner the week’s top honors. But some other Crimson athletes put up fine weekend performances as well, earning Athlete of the Week Runner Up nods from The Back Page.
 
Jillian Dempsey, Women’s Hockey
The senior forward has been absolutely dominant this season in the Crimson’s front line. This week’s performances were no different. Dempsey netted a pair of goals in Harvard’s 5-1 routing of Connecticut earlier this week. Over the weekend, Dempsey scored the game winning goal off a power play in Harvard’s 1-0 victory over Union. For the season, Dempsey has a team-high 21 goals and 16 assists for 37 points, 10 more than any other player on the Crimson’s roster. The senior is the ECAC’s leading scorer, averaging 1.167 goals per game.
 
Steve Moundou-Missi, Men’s Basketball
 
The sophomore played a key role in keeping Harvard close in its weekend contest at Memphis. The forward put up 10 points and seven rebounds off the bench in 27 minutes of playing time. Moundou-Missi’s dunk with less than eight minutes to go gave Harvard its first lead of the game and the sophomore added two more key free throws a minute later to tie the contest, but the Crimson would eventually fell, 60-50.
 
DJ White, Men’s Volleyball
The sophomore outside hitter helped get Harvard’s season off to a hot start. The Crimson won a pair of opening weekend matchups against Stevens and NYU. White recorded 19 kills in Harvard’s 3-0 victory over the Ducks, while also adding three digs and two block assists. The following evening, the sophomore put up nine kills, seven digs, and four blocks in Crimson’s 3-0 win over the Violets.

Brian Rogers' job search is officially over.The former Harvard men's soccer forward, who graduated a semester early in the fall in anticipation of going pro, will be playing professional soccer after he was drafted in the second round as the 29th overall pick of the MLS Supplemental Draft on Tuesday by the Vancouver Whitecaps FC.“I’m just really excited that Vancouver has decided to give me an opportunity to continue playing for at least the time being,” Rogers said.Rogers’ climb to the MLS will be an uphill one. Of the four Ivy League players selected in the Supplemental Draft last season, three were cut within a year. If he makes the team, the forward will join Andre Akpan ’10 (Colorado Rapids) and Mike Fucito ’09 (San Jose Earthquakes) in the league.“I wasn’t really expecting [to be drafted],” he said. “I hadn’t really thought about it because of my not having played that much over the last few years, so I had been making other plans to play overseas. [But] this is a great opportunity.”
His former coach, Carl Junot, said he had talked to the Whitecaps’ coaching staff about Rogers’ potential.“I think he’s a player that can play at that level,” Junot said. “In the [MLS] Brian is a target forward.... His ability to fit in with what they are doing still needs to be proven, but athletically, he’s there.”Rogers is hoping he will be able to establish himself in the league after an up-and-down career at Harvard that began with a standout rookie campaign but was littered with injury and team struggles from then on.As a freshman in 2009, the forward won Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors after ranking second on the Crimson with 18 points and six goals. Those numbers established him as a legitimate number two option alongside Akpan, and together the pair helped lead Harvard to the Sweet 16 and a Top 10 ranking.“Andre kind of took me under my wing my freshman year, and I’ve kept in good touch with him even after he graduated,” Rogers said. “He sent a ‘congratulations’ to me so I’m sure I’ll speak with him later today or tomorrow to get some advice about what to expect as I go into preseason games.”Rogers’ sophomore season began on a similar high when he scored the game-winning goal in the 80th minute to lead the No. 10 Crimson to a win over No. 13 Stanford in front of a sold-out home crowd in Harvard’s season opener. The forward displayed a flair for the dramatic again later in the month when he scored a game-tying goal in the 90th minute against Stony Brook, and he finished with five scores on the season.But the final two years of Rogers’ career were dominated by injury, as he played in just 19 total games and scored only three goals. With Rogers as the number one option, his team failed to replicate the success it had when he was playing off of Akpan and went just 5-23-6 over the last two seasons.“He only got stronger,” Junot said. “He learned to play within a different system, learned to play against better players, learned to manage injuries, which is really important for any career. Players get injuries; it’s how they manage them that determines how their career will go.”Despite those struggles, the Whitecaps clearly saw something they liked in the senior, who becomes the first Harvard player ever to be selected in the Supplemental Draft and the first since Akpan and Kwaku Nyamekye ’10 three years ago to be drafted by the MLS at all.“I just got a call from one of the assistant coaches to congratulate me and tell me they’re excited for me to come in,” Rogers said. “Nothing’s guaranteed. I’ll still be competing for a roster spot.”Princeton’s Mark Linnville was also selected in the Supplemental Draft—as the 24th overall pick by the Philadelphia Union—while Brown’s Dylan Remick was taken in the second round of the SuperDraft last week by the Sounders.The Whitecaps open training camp next week in Burnaby, British Columbia, and play their first preseason match against Seattle on February 6.“His work has really only just begun,” Junot said. “I always think getting drafted means very little. It’s about what you do in camp.”—Staff writer Scott A. Sherman can be reached at ssherman13@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: January 22, 2013, at 1:01 a.m.Harvard has delivered verdicts to all of the approximately 125 students ensnared in the Government 1310 cheating scandal and plans to make an announcement about the results of the investigation near the start of the spring semester, according to a Harvard spokesperson. Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement that the Administrative Board finished evaluating the set of cases in December.  
Though Neal did not provide a specific date for the planned announcement, he wrote that it would come “near the beginning of the new semester, after students and faculty have returned to campus.” He also did not say how much new information would be released, but the Ad Board’s website states that the Board is bound to confidentiality about case specifics even after an investigation has concluded.  The completion of the investigation marks a turning point for the scandal that Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris called “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory” when it was <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/"">first announced at the end of August. Over the past semester, the Ad Board investigated approximately half of the undergraduates enrolled in last spring’s offering of Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” for plagiarism and inappropriate collaboration on a take-home final exam. Administrators said that each case would be resolved <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/11/cheating-students-judged-individually/ "">on an individual basis. Harvard did not put forward a deadline for the completion of the investigation, yet one student said in an interview with The Crimson that he was told that his case would be resolved by November at the latest. Ultimately, some cases were not resolved until near the end of the fall semester. “The cases were exceptionally complex and involved far more students than any other set of cases in recent memory, requiring great amounts of time and effort from the staff and faculty involved,” Neal wrote in his statement on Friday.  To <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/17/Administration_Gov1310/ "">handle the increased workload, Harvard hired “fact finders” to assist with the investigation, and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds canceled a graduate seminar she had been slated to teach in the fall of 2012 in part due to the demands of the case. Now that all verdicts have been issued, Harvard could potentially <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/10/possible-lawsuits-cheating-scandal/"">face lawsuits from aggrieved students who may claim that the Ad Board did not follow the procedures listed in the student handbook while evaluating each case.—Staff writer Elizabeth S.

Let the countdown to the Harbowl begin. Wins by the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens Sunday set up the first all-brother Super Bowl coaching matchup. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh will face younger brother Jim Feb. 3 in New Orleans.
The matchup prompted The Back Page to look for Harvard games that involved similar sibling rivalries. We found the McLaughlins.<a name=""jump"">Frank McLaughlin coached the Harvard men's basketball team from 1977 to 1985, compiling a 99-110 record over eight seasons.  McLaughlin may be best remembered for his 1983-84 squad, which set the NCAA single-season free throw record (82.2 percent) that still stands today.
But McLaughlin's tenure is also unusual because of two early-season, non-conference games. Why? Because McLaughlin's younger brother Tom coached UMass. From 1981 to 1983, Tom McLaughlin led the Minutemen, who went 16-40 during his two seasons at the bench.
<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1981/12/12/the-frankie-and-tommy-show-pits/"">This December 1981 article previewed Frank and Tom's first match-up. The two brothers downplayed any rivalry, but former Notre Dame coach and current ESPN analyst Digger Phelps, under whom both McLaughlins had coached as assistants, thought differently:
""They're lying,"" Phelps said. ""They want to beat each others' brains out. They're just being nice to each other, and they'll be nice to each other until the jump ball.""
<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1981/12/14/umass-stops-crimson-75-73-pthe-little/"">UMass edged Harvard, 75-73, at the MAC in 1981. Frank coached through a ruptured disc in his back as the Crimson dropped its fourth straight.
<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1982/2/6/crimson-rallies-to-nip-umass-dixon/"">But Frank would have the last laugh on December 4, 1982. Trailing 38-25 with 11:07 left in regulation, Harvard staged what writer Mike Knobler described as ""one of the biggest turnarounds in Crimson history.""
Harvard point guard Calvin Dixon led his team on a 18-2 run as the visiting Crimson emerged victorious in an absolute barn-burner, 45-44.
""He's about 10 years older than me now,"" Frank joked after the game about his brother, who is four years his junior.
By the second half of the decade, unfortunately, both Frank and Tom had drifted away from coaching, precluding any more McLaughlin thrillers. Frank served as Fordham's athletic director for 27 years before taking an emeritus role in May 2012. Tom is the founder and CEO of Best In Sports, Inc., a sports marketing and representation firm.
If the game in New Orleans is as close as either of the McLaughlin Bowls, football fans are in for a treat.

For the first time in 13 days, Jeremy Lin ’10’s Houston Rockets could slap hands and smile as the final buzzer rang. After seven consecutive losses, Houston came from behind in Monday’s game at the Charlotte Bobcats, taking the lead in the fourth quarter and winning shortly after, 100-94.
The effort was largely led by Rockets James Harden and Marcus Morris, who tallied a combined 50 points, 15 rebounds, and nine assists. Lin, for his part, contributed four points on one-of-five shooting, collecting three rebounds and two assists in 24 minutes of playing time—an amount nine minutes under his season average.
The oddity in his minutes came largely from the fact that Lin did not play one second in the fourth quarter—Houston head coach Kevin McHale elected to go with rookie point guard Patrick Beverly instead. When asked about the basis of this decision, McHale did not give much insight.
“We were just sticking with what worked,” McHale explained. “[Beverly has] got to get with what we’re doing a little bit. He hasn’t been here very long. Practice tomorrow is going to be big for him. He’ll get some more sets down and get some stuff we’re doing. Hopefully we can start building on this.”
While the emergence of Beverly may not be beneficial for Lin’s time on the floor, it was certainly positive for the Rockets on Monday afternoon. With the squad’s win and the Minnesota Timberwolves’ loss, Houston gains a full game in the standings on the T-Wolves, launching it back into the final playoff seed for the time being.

It just grooves and breathes, showcasing a fully independent star mature enough to forge her own path rather than simply revel in her sister's spotlight.<!--more-->Perhaps the most outstanding part of ""True"" is its production, in which gorgeous keyboards with varying levels of reverb slip in between bass-heavy electronic drum kits and layers of Solange's oohs. The songwriting isn't particularly different than what she's done in the past; Solange could have written the simple, catchy R&amp;B melody of <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bRkrp0CjFY""'>""Some Things Never Seem to Fucking Work"" three years ago, only she might have called it ""Ode to the Vandellas,"" and it would have been driven by a '70s-style horn section and a tambourine.Here, though, the electronic hi-hat shimmies along, while the Rhodes provides a fragile backing for morose lyrics like, ""I'm thinking of some time off / I'm dreaming of a time that you knew me."" Indie producer Dev Hynes even throws in an eerie spoken word verse at the end to fit the vibe.Throughout the tight seven-track EP, Solange shows full her commitment to her lo-fi, decidedly un-Beyoncé-esque sound. The fluttering piano riff on ""Locked in Closets"" comes straight from the James Blake playbook. The drum breakdown on ""Lovers in the Parking Lot"" is more EDM than anything else. And on ""Don't Let Me Down,"" the whining, wah-ing horn synthesizers sound like they're making a mockery of classic soul arrangements rather than paying homage.
So while Beyoncé has belted her way to the center, Solange has drifted to the edges. She joins a steadily growing R&amp;B fringe—<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvaw7SYJtLI"">Jessie Ware, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbdeacVXbik"">How to Dress Well, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9PuAm7d0PA"">The Weeknd—that revels in synthetic sounds and opaque emotions. It's not music for the center of the party, but rather for the lonely wallflower or the unrequited lover. This group of loners may not give rise to a totally cohesive movement—they are loners, after all—but they provide an intriguing and sonically intense deviation to a genre that frequently seems to be spinning its wheels in place.Check out more Arts music coverage <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/tag/Music/"">here.

It’s January, a month devoid of the $100 million franchise blockbusters that litter the screen in the summertime. For passionate moviegoers, Oscar buzz serves as a form of entertainment, as they desperately seek to see the films the esteemed Academy has named Best Picture candidates. It’s award season in Hollywood.The annual television spectacle is set for February 24. This year, nine films are competing for the little gold man that took the permanent nickname “Oscar” in 1939, <a href=""http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html"">10 years after the ceremony’s commencement in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1929"">1929. “Amour,” “Argo,” “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” “Django Unchained,” “Les Misérables,” “Life of Pi,” “Lincoln,” “Silver Linings Playbook,” and “Zero Dark Thirty” all stand for the category of Best Picture. That nine motion pictures can qualify for the prestigious award is a result of the <a href=""http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/06/oscars-expand-the-bestpicture-race-to-10-films.html"">2010 expansion to include up to 10 films instead of five. However, the lack of a commensurate expansion in the Best Director category has lead to a failure to recognize the incredible achievements of the artists behind these masterpieces. Considering the rich cinematic history of the Oscars and the sheer talent of the coveted filmmakers that have walked the red carpet, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences must understand that a Best Picture nominee should correspond to a similar recognition of the director.To create an Oscar-worthy film, a plethora of elements must fall perfectly in line to assemble the complete motion picture—an intricate puzzle. The writer must produce a screenplay that not only catches the eye of studio executives, but also brings together a cast and crew with a common vision for the screen. The actors must sweep the audience off their feet and provide a vicarious, two-hour experience in another world. The editor must combine these assorted scenes into a final product that masterfully adorns screens across the world.However, it is the director that takes a story and turns it into an audio-visual experience. The director’s vision becomes the driving force that ultimately creates a celebrated and critically acclaimed work. It is the director’s perspective that takes the audience on a cinematic journey. It is the director that demands and facilitates the breathtaking performances from his actors. It is the director that transforms words on a page into a spectacle of aesthetics.   To put it in perspective, imagine an author crafting an extraordinary book that not only finds its way to the top of The New York Times bestseller list, but also receives incredible reviews from critics. This same novel that captivated readers worldwide finds itself up for a Pulitzer along with nine other books. However, the author himself is not nominated for award consideration—just the book and, by extension, its publishers.
In a similar manner, the director is the one that puts this intricate puzzle together into a breathtaking film. He or she becomes the captain of the ship throughout the lengthy production process as 100 pages of script come to life. The director is not only the artist behind the film, but also the facilitator and enabler of its physical creation.It is no secret that the expansion of the Best Picture category stems from primarily commercial concerns. The Academy Awards is a media spectacle that hosts millions of viewers across the world. Each year, the Dolby Theatre (formerly Kodak Theatre) is filled with enough star power to necessitate a pre-show red carpet special. As the human fascination with celebrities drives the ratings, the 2010 move to include more films up for Best Picture was reflected in <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/abcs-oscar-audience-grows-by-14-biggest-number-in-five-years.html"">an increase of five millions viewers from <a href=""http://www.today.com/id/29352325/site/todayshow/ns/today-entertainment/t/oscars-increases-viewership-million/"">2009.This focus on commercializing the event threatens to snub the auteurs that make the marketing possible. For example, if “Argo” continues its current Best Picture winning streak, Ben Affleck could see his work celebrated without any personal recognition, let alone a congratulatory nomination for his accomplishment. Kathryn Bigelow has gone unnoticed for her thrilling adaptation of Osama bin Laden’s death in “Zero Dark Thirty.” In these visionaries’ places are the directors of smaller films like “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which, though beautiful and poetic, should not contend with the likes of Affleck and Bigelow.The Academy must separate itself from its attempts to maximize its television ratings and reflect on the role it has had in shaping cinematic history. By ignoring the injustice it currently has in place and buying into the consumer aspects of a publicly televised award ceremony, the Academy Awards slowly becomes more like reality television. What would the Oscar for “The Godfather Part II” have been without director Francis Ford Coppola receiving a similar award? What about “Schindler’s List” and Steven Spielberg?The time has come for the Academy to acknowledge the narrative voice of the director and its correlation with exemplary filmmaking. The artist must be tied to his work and awarded in a similar manner. With the two categories so lopsided each and every year, directors of front-running films will continue to go unrewarded for their work. It is time to right this injustice.Connor P. McKnight ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Grays Hall.

Two weeks after Donald M. Berwick ’68 confirmed that he has been contemplating running for governor of Massachusetts in 2014, he said he plans to embark on a “listening tour” of the state in the coming weeks.Berwick, a health care policy lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said in an interview with The Crimson that he will focus on learning about the state and about the concerns of Massachusetts voters.“I have a lot of ideas about what I want to accomplish, but I also have a lot to learn,” Berwick said. “The exciting thing to be doing now is learning.”Berwick returned to Massachusetts in Dec. 2011 after working under president Barack Obama as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Berwick said that he hopes to use his expertise in health care policy to improve all sectors of the Massachusetts health care system.
“We’ve got the potential for showing the country what world class success can look like across the board,” he said.Should he run, Berwick would build on Massachusetts’s position as a leader in healthcare and education by tackling issues ranging from education to the environment to unemployment, he said.During his 17-month tenure as administrator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented many of the provisions included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that Obama signed into law in March 2010.As administrator, Berwick drew opposition from conservatives for many of his proposals, such as the rationing of health care services to prevent rising costs. Berwick had also previously stated that an efficient health care system involved a redistribution of wealth, prompting further opposition from conservative critics.Berwick entered office after Obama bypassed Senate approval for Berwick’s position and named him as a recess appointee in July 2010 before the Senate could schedule official confirmation hearings.After Obama formally nominated Berwick for the post again in January 2011, a group of Republican senators wrote to the president demanding that he withdraw the nomination. Faced with such strong opposition to his confirmation, Berwick stepped down in December 2011.Berwick, who said that he was “always interested in public policy and healthcare,” began his career as a pediatrician, graduating in 1972 from Harvard Medical School and Harvard Kennedy School. In 1991, he went on to become a co-founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit that, according to Berwick, aims “to improve healthcare all over the world.”In 1990s, he also helped reform Britain’s National Health Service and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for his efforts.If Berwick decides to run, he will follow in the footsteps of Senator Elizabeth Warren—another Harvard professor who returned after a brief stint in Washington to run for office in Massachusetts. Berwick said that Warren’s victory has proved that a candidate who has spent most of his or her career outside of politics can succeed in the political arena.Only one candidate for the governorship, Joseph Avellone—a fellow Medical School alumnus—has officially thrown his hat in the ring. Avellone, health care executive and former Wellesley, Mass., selectman, announced his candidacy to the Boston Globe on Jan. 8.Other potential candidates include Michael E. Capuano, a congressman in the Seventh District, and Steven Grossman, the state treasurer.—Staff writer Julia K. Dean can be reached at juliadean@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Laura K.

Personal trainer Kerry Antunes encouraged Harvard students to find time for exercise in their hectic schedules during a presentation on physical fitness Wednesday.“What I try to suggest in the talk is that the gym isn’t so scary,” said Antunes, who works at Hemenway Gymnasium. “It can be realistic and it’s a way of life. If you start doing it now you won’t face a lot of things that a lot of older people are facing now like diabetes or high blood pressure or cholesterol.”The talk, which was attended by a mix of College and graduate school students, is part of a larger effort by the University to promote consistent fitness and nutrition through a series of events run during Wintersession.During Wednesday’s talk, Antunes advocated finding enjoyable and accessible exercise routines as well as being practical about what is doable given the many commitments of Harvard students.“Being realistic,” Antunes said. “I think that the biggest thing is being realistic and knowing what you like and finding something you like.”
Antunes emphasized accountability in one’s exercise regime, encouraging students to find a workout buddy and use applications like myfitnesspal.com, a website and phone application that allows users to track their caloric intakes and workout schedules.Despite the cold weather and hectic schedules, Harvard students still should strive to achieve the basic health and mental benefits of exercise laid out in the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for physical activity, Antunes said. The ACSM suggests 30 minutes of moderate to intense exercise five times a week.Antunes tried to change the image of the gym as a scary place during her talk.“You think people are staring at you but they’re not,” Antunes said. “They’re always staring at themselves.”She outlined the multitude of exercise options offered by the University at low to no cost, such as fee-based personal training sessions and free group exercise classes.Despite all the bells and whistles of Harvard recreation, Antunes recommended that one’s basic routine be based on the concept “keep it simple, stupid.” She described a sample total body workout that a student could ideally perform twice a week anywhere, from the gym to the dorm room.Jonne K. Saleva ’16, who attended the event, said he was impressed by the many exercise opportunities discussed by Anunes and that he plans to try them out over the coming semester.“I knew that there’s a lot of stuff going on at Harvard but I wanted to see it explicitly on a PowerPoint slide because I already work out [and] I just wanted to see the other opportunities that are available,” Saleva said. “I’ve read about this stuff before, but it’s always good to reiterate it.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

I support the decision to bring former Mexican President Felipe Calderón as a fellow to the Harvard Kennedy School. The prestige of Harvard’s name will bring needed attention to a critically important country that has been totally missing from America’s national debate. However, the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/4/defend-calderon-appointment/"">reasons cited by some Harvard professors for this decision are woefully misguided. Although Calderón showed courage in taking on the drug cartels immediately after his election in 2006, his decision to mobilize the military and the federal police and in effect “decapitate” the cartels by killing off their leaders was a disaster. His stubborn refusal to recognize that he had made a mistake cost the lives of thousands of innocent Mexicans. In addition, for people who live in extraordinary poverty in places like Ciudad Juárez, Calderón’s talk about improved health care and better economic opportunities is a fantasy.On July 28, 2010, I made my first trip to Juárez as part of an ongoing project to write about the various humanitarian groups on the border. At that time Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world: In 2009, the city had the world’s highest <a href=""http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/104593.html"">murder rate. Stranded in the center of town at about 9 a.m., I watched as a federal police patrol of three dark blue pickup trucks repeatedly circled our area. With six heavily armed men in each truck, this was an intimidating show of force. Yet this approach obviously accomplished little when it came to identifying, arresting, and prosecuting those committing the murders and other violent crimes.On subsequent visits, I would drive across at the Santa Teresa crossing on the west side of Juárez, nervously passing through one military checkpoint at the crossing and another one a few miles south. Again, the questions were clear: Why are all these soldiers out in the desert when the killings are taking place in the city? What skills do soldiers have in the policing process?The questions concern much more than a misallocation of resources. One must wonder to what extent the federal police and the military became involved in the drug business and the killings themselves. Why is it that the homicide rate has <a href=""http://diario.mx/Local/2012-12-31_60f64e9f/tiene-juarez-menor-numero-de-homicidios-en-cinco-anos/"">dropped so dramatically with their departure?Furthermore, there is the claim that Calderón improved health care. In these monthly trips to Juárez as well as small towns to its west, I’ve had the chance to visit orphanages, food banks, a privately run mental asylum, a Christmas gift program, a rehab center for young women involved in drugs and prostitution, a migrant labor camp for Mixteca Indians, and dozens of individual homes. These impoverished people might as well be on Mars because there are simply no adequate social services here for them. For example, in Guadalupe Victoria, a migrant worker camp with pools of foul water is less than a half-mile from the homes of the well-to-do farm owners. It would not be difficult for a government official to tell the farmers to provide clean drinking water to their workers. Yet Mixteca Indians come north from their home states of Oaxaca and Guerrero because conditions there are even worse. Their only salvation comes from humanitarian individuals and groups who have volunteered to help, often at great personal risk.
In terms of the economy and jobs, there are other Mixteca Indians trying to sell trinkets at the Santa Teresa crossing, young men offering to wash your car in Palomas, and men walking for hours along the Juárez-Chihuahua roadway picking up aluminum cans. But these are not real jobs. And the minimum wage is only about <a href=""http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_19615495"">$4.32 a day, one third of the <a href=""http://www.cambridgema.gov/deptann.cfm?story_id=2043"">hourly living wage in Cambridge.Given this lack of opportunity and alternatives, it is no wonder that young people, many of whom have been orphaned by or lost relatives to this violence, turn to gangs and cartels. What ever made Calderón believe that killing off cartel leaders wouldn’t simply lead to a bloody scramble to replace them? Why have the underlying social issues been ignored for so long?These are American issues as well. It’s our money that buys the drugs, our guns that fuel the violence, and our political leadership that has shied away from addressing the immigration problem and the failed War on Drugs. Harvard can bring visibility to these issues, but only if Calderón's appointment is an honest dialogue and not just a defense of the “Calderón legacy.”Morgan Smith '60, has been traveling to Mexico since his Harvard years. He now travels to Juárez and other border towns to assist and write about humanitarian programs.

One official’s arm went up. Then another’s. In the blink of an eye, the Harvard men’s hockey team faced a two-minute 5-on-3 penalty kill midway through the final frame of a one-goal game at Union College.The Dutchmen power play unit capitalized for the second time on the night to open up a two-goal advantage. No. 19 Union (12-8-4, 6-4-3 ECAC) would strike twice more in the final 12 minutes as the Crimson (5-11-1, 3-9-0 ECAC) lost its fourth straight, 4-1.Down 1-0 with 12:24 remaining in the third period, Harvard was whistled for two minors as senior forward Marshall Everson went to the box for hooking and classmate Luke Greiner joined him for high sticking.“It was really weird,” senior forward Alex Fallstrom said of the simultaneous penalties. “It kind of came as a surprise to me because I didn’t really see what happened, but it was unfortunate and really hurt us in the game.”Union quickly capitalized on the opportunity, winning the next faceoff in Harvard’s zone and looping fifteen passes around the three Crimson defenders before senior forward Wayne Simpson tapped one in from close range to put the home team up by a pair.
“[Union] moved the puck well and obviously took advantage of that five-on-three,” Fallstrom said. “That was the turning point of the game.”The Dutchman forecheck pressured Harvard from start to finish. Union directed more shots on net than the Crimson in each period for an overall advantage of 38 to 23.The two teams remained scoreless after the first period as Harvard failed to convert on its only two power plays of the night. But the Crimson defense only yielded a few early opportunities to the Dutchmen.“We started out more structured overall, which helped me a lot in the defensive zone,” said junior Crimson goaltender Raphael Girard, who had 34 saves on the night.“I think we were really playing sound defensively for the first 40 minutes or so,” Fallstrom added.With less than four minutes remaining in the second, sophomore forward Max Novak put Union on the score sheet after a holding minor on Harvard forward Ryan McGregor provided the Dutchmen their third power play of the night. Union junior defender Mat Bodie fed the puck to Novak, who slung a shot from the top of the slot past a screen by freshman linemate Matt Wilkins.“Starting in the second period, we took many penalties that ended up being momentum changers and allowed [Union] to spend a lot of time in our zone,” Girard said. “They got some scoring chances off of that and capitalized at the right moment.”In the final frame, Harvard managed to kill the remainder of the Union power play following Simpson’s goal.Less than two minutes after the Crimson returned to full strength, a rare icing from the Dutchmen provided Harvard one of its few chances of the night.Center Collin Blackwell won the faceoff to Jimmy Vesey, who launched a wrister inside the circle before Union goalie Troy Grosenick could locate the puck.

I had never known anyone to be killed before. That is, before last semester.Earlier this fall, Harvard students got word on campus that Philip V. Streich ‘13 had died on his family’s farm in Wisconsin. Philip was the first person I ever knew from Harvard, as I had met him at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair four years ago. It was shocking to realize that someone so brilliant could be vulnerable to having a bright future cut short.Then there was the December shooting at a shopping mall just miles away from my house in Oregon. I knew one of the two victims. Steve Forsyth was the stepfather of a childhood friend and an incredibly compassionate guy we are all heartbroken to have lost.Finally, two days before Christmas, a boy from my high school graduating class, one of the kindest, most genuine people I’ve ever met, died in a car crash. Drake Edwards was just 20 years old when he and his friends were driving home from the mountain and suddenly lost control, swerving into oncoming traffic. He was the only passenger killed.If tragedy comes in waves, this is one hell of a rip current, unforeseen by all.
This winter break, in addition to family time and Christmas carols, I’ve been spending a great deal of time reflecting on recent events. I haven’t even addressed the massacre in Newtown, which hit families across the America with a profound sadness. I am not going to breach the subjects of mental health or gun control or safe driving—there is a time and place for those topics, and this editorial is not one of them. This is about more than that.I’ve struggled to extract the meaning from all of this hardship. To find the takeaway message for myself, who felt so inextricably connected to this web of tragedy. It would be easy to look at the lives of these men who died too young and say, “life is short, live while you can,” but this clichéd piece of advice fails to capture the solidarity that followed the heartbreak. More than anything, I am struck by one resounding message.People are what matters. I suppose I may be biased as an anthropology concentrator, but these jarring reminders of the brevity of our lives have only helped to convince me that, politics, religion, and socioeconomic status aside, it is the connections we form with other people that define our experiences.Listening to friends and family speak at Drake Edwards’ funeral in my hometown, I was overwhelmed by the compassion of the community around us. So many people from my high school had turned up to show their support in a tragic sort of class reunion where we all wore black instead of nametags. Yet as terrible as the circumstances were, the gathering was completely representative of Drake’s character. His smile, his laughter, and his love were infectious, and everyone who met him was affected by the fervency with which he lived his life.What I respected most about Drake was that he made time for everyone, and ultimately I suppose that is the real takeaway from all of the sadness this season. Make time for people. Listen. We can have our groceries delivered to our door without even talking to a cashier, but is that really how we should live our lives? Are we really too “busy” to engage with others?Recently, in a Powell’s Books restroom, a store employee’s actions pleasantly reminded me of the kindness of strangers. While I was tending to a wound on my foot the woman came up to me and offered to get me a Band-Aid, returning minutes later with a handful of plasters and ointment. “Foot trouble can just ruin your whole day,” she said with a smile before returning to work. I asked myself, would I have done the same for a stranger?There is no excuse for not acknowledging those who have been significant in our lives and for not thanking those who have helped us along the way. For tuning into your Facebook instead of your nephew’s fascination with LEGOS. For not returning phone calls. For ignoring your cleaning lady. The smallest interactions can make the biggest difference, and we have no way of knowing our full impact on the lives of others. Drake’s funeral was testament to that.I am no saint; I neglect my parents and have my fair share of grumpy days. It is easy to prioritize other things in the midst of midterms and financial crises. As we get older those distractions become still stronger, and it becomes even easier to keep to ourselves. But I try to remember that the fragility of our existence is all the more reason to cherish every day, to make the effort to connect with others. One of the speakers at Drake’s funeral said this of his life: “Rather than being counted in days, his was better measured in lives touched.” An admirable goal for us all.Anneli L.

The so-called Kogan Chang Ma Trio—a group of three friends at Harvard who went on to become some of the College’s most famous musical alumni—reunited Tuesday afternoon in the Kirkland House Junior Common Room for an installment of the Office for the Arts’s Learning from Performers program.Cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, pianist Richard Kogan ’77, and violinist Lynn Chang ’75 performed briefly for the nearly full room and proceeded to discuss their time at Harvard, how their paths diverged after graduation, and how students involved in the arts can further those interests.Chang said that as undergraduates, he and his two friends “had all the same questions that many of you are asking.”The event began with the performance of part of Ludwig Van Beethoven’s short piece “Before I Work, I Must Eat.” Chang joked that for the trio’s performance, a more relevant title might have been “Before We Speak, We Must Play.”OFA director Jack C. Megan said that the impetus for the event was a conversation that Ma, Kogan, and Chang had at Chang’s daughter’s wedding about how each of their careers had developed to include activities other than performance.
In 1998, Ma founded the Silk Road Project, an artistic and educational organization dedicated to the cultural history of the ancient Silk Road.Kogan, a concert pianist who also attended Harvard Medical School, has become a prominent psychiatrist known for lecturing on the relationship between music and medicine.Lynn, a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, holds faculty positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Boston Conservatory, and the New England Conservatory.“There are so many wonderful ways to live life in the arts,” Megan said. “I was dying to bring that conversation here.”Each of the performers spoke about their time at the College, at times poking fun of each other and drawing repeated laughs from the crowd.Kogan said that he did not enjoy practice as an undergraduate, calling his relationship with music at the time a “kind of a shotgun marriage.” Still, he recalled being inspired to see about 30 of his neighbors in Hurlbut attend one of his concerts with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra.“Seeing how excited they were about music was a thrill for me,” Kogan said.Ma said that working with Kogan and Chang taught him how to solve problems as a group, though they “teased me incessantly.”All three men declared that students interested in the arts should not be afraid to create unconventional paths for themselves.“I think it’s normal to feel conflict, and I think it’s also okay to not have all the answers,” Ma said. “It’s always going to be not what you expected.”—Staff writer Samuel Y.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Addressing a crowd of hundreds of thousands of supporters lining the National Mall, President Barack Obama laid out a bold progressive agenda for his final four years in office. Once criticized by liberal supporters at Harvard and beyond for dragging his feet on liberal causes, Obama received praise for his speech from left-leaning activists at Harvard and beyond and, some said, rejuvenated hope in his progressive bona fides.“I thought it was great, the civil rights agenda that he outlined, he touched on gay rights, immigrant rights...At this point, they’re not even political issues, they’re things that have to get done,” said Julia B. Konrad ’13, who served as vice president of Harvard’s Institute of Politics this past year. “People are over a lot of radical Republicanism.”Obama’s repeated references to gay rights were among a diverse array of statements in the speech that suggested an increased commitment to a wide array of progressive causes. Running at just under 20 minutes in length, Obama’s speech promised action on climate change, reform in immigration policy, and improvements to social welfare programs.Portions of the crowd erupted in applause at many of Obama’s references to these issues. At other points, attendees broke out in tears.“It seemed like he was coming to terms for what he stood for,” said Faith A. Jackson ’16. “It was interesting to see him talk about things not just in theory but how they were applied.”
Jackson, who served as a volunteer for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren during the 2012 election, said that the speech helped emphasize that change is a slow process that would continue throughout Obama’s second term.“America is just one big ship that takes time [to turn] before you actually start moving in a new direction,” Jackson said. “Everything takes time...We’re not stalling.”At times, Obama used his speech as a call to action, telling the audience that change could be achieved with broad civic commitment across the political spectrum.Whether enthusiasm over the speech will translate into broad support for Obama’s positions on politically divisive issues remains to be seen, but several Harvard students who <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/23/students-attend-obama-inauguration/"">attended the inauguration said they would likely continue to work to advance Obama’s causes.For other Harvard students, the swearing-in ceremony and the address that followed represented a moment devoid of partisanship and an opportunity to witness a highlight of American politics.“It’s [an] example of the greatness of the American political process,” said Benjamin Y. Zhou ’15. “It’s such a spectacle seeing everything come together.”—Staff writer Justin C. Worland can be reached at jworland@college.harvard.edu.

In 1968, shortly before his death, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. made a speech pondering his legacy. He reflected, “Every now and then I wonder what I want them to say.” It is human nature for an individual to ponder how he or she will be remembered after the earthly departure. Presidents want to be remembered for their achievements in office. Artists want to be remembered for their most discerning works. Many are content with being remembered simply for their devotion to family. What, then, of a unique historical figure like Reverend King, the American champion of civil disobedience?King himself eloquently answered for us this very question. “If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness, and all of the shallow things will not matter.”As we recognize the birthday of Reverend King again this year, it is crucial to look at the man from this perspective. While he may have died over 40 years ago, time has shown that the tempo kept by this visionary drum major has singularly transformed the fabric of American society. This accomplishment is indicative of the dynamic power of rallying an idea around an individual.The official recognition of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day on the third Monday of January each year serves as an important reminder of the unmatched influence of certain individuals in changing the makeup of a nation. American culture loves its heroes, and every schoolchild is taught of the near-divine statuses of elected leaders like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Unlike these men, however, Martin Luther King, Jr. and the dream he proffered were not elected by a majority of American citizens. On the contrary, King had been fighting for the cause for many years before civil rights became (even tenuously) politically viable. While the reverend's dream was not called for by the American people, it was a necessary vision to address silent ailments festering below the surface of society.This year, the celebration of the life and work of Reverend King fell on another important day, that of the second inaugural address of the nation’s first African American president. In his speech, President Obama alluded to King’s legacy, proclaiming that all of us are created equal, harking back, “to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.”
As long as there is a heterogeneous United States of America, there will be social ills that plague our interpersonal interactions. Yet there will also always be the lesson of freedom and equality handed down from our Founding Fathers. There are times when society will be reluctant to change, but there will persist the idea on which the diverse American fabric has been woven. Sometimes it takes an ordinary person to take up that idea and remind each and every one of us of its profound import. Such was the case with Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the most instrumental drum majors this nation has ever seen.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Harvard students descended on the nation’s capital this past weekend for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama, braving freezing temperatures for the swearing-in ceremony, waiting in lines that wrapped around city corners for the inaugural balls, and pushing through thousands of people to witness the inaugural parade.Despite a crowd that early estimates placed at close to a million people in size, Harvard students still managed find each other among the masses.Katie G. Walsh ’14, who attended the group with several friends from Harvard, said that while waiting in line for the swearing-in ceremony she turned around only to see another Harvard student who, like her, is involved in the Institute of Politics.Julia B. Konrad ’13 said that although she worked in Washington this past summer, a large part of what prompted her to attend the inauguration were her political experiences at Harvard, where she formerly served as vice president of the IOP and was active in the Harvard Democrats.The 2012 campaign, which resulted in the election of a U.S. president that she felt strongly about, was the first that she felt very much a part of, Konrad said.
“I think a lot of that came from the IOP and the Harvard Democrats and being around other Harvard students,” said Konrad. “For me, my Harvard experience is very wrapped up in my political experiences and my campaign experiences.”Konrad watched the swearing-in ceremony from a location close to the Washington Monument, at the very end of a crowd that stretched from the steps of the Capitol building. Although the ceremony went by generally without a hitch, only minutes into Obama’s inaugural address, the Jumbotron near Konrad and her group of Harvard friends broke.Despite the technical difficulties and the distance, Konrad said she thought the amped-up atmosphere of Washington D.C. during inauguration weekend was excitement enough.“It’s very, very rare that you have so many people gathered in one place with so much energy and enthusiasm about our political future,” Konrad said.For many students, the highlight of inauguration weekend was Obama’s inaugural address, a nearly 20-minute speech that throughout prompted approving cries from onlookers and by its end left more than a few audience members teary-eyed.Charles A. Hobbs ’13, who attended both of Obama’s inaugural ceremonies, said he thought this year’s address was “a different type of speech” than the one the president gave in 2009.“I was excited to hear the president come out strong on issues like equal rights for gays and lesbians and climate change,” Hobbs said.“Certainly these are issues that I believe are important for our country... and it was exciting for me to see that they aren’t things that he’s given up on in his second term.”—Staff writer Hana N.

<span style=""font-size: 10px;"">There is a man in the rafters. He is inching his way across a wooden joist, ten feet beneath a roof of corrugated metal and fifteen feet above a potential disaster. From below, he looks foreshortened and strange—large feet dangling, spindly arms clutching the beam, and, far above, a tiny head grimacing in concentration. He is focused on his task. We do not know what his task is. “I can’t watch this.”
 The crowd disperses beneath him. No one wants to watch the fall, but it doesn’t feel appropriate to look away either. He is sitting up now. A smile spreads across his face as he notices his audience. He waves. I realize I am yelling at him to get down. There is a chorus of us now, disturbed by his stunt, frustrated but powerless, selfishly wishing we could keep dancing. We are angry hundreds and we are loud. For the first time tonight, the music has vocals; in spite of myself, I am grateful for the voices that break up the DJ’s monotony.  Yet before we know it, the man is inching back—suspiciously more lithely than he did in his advance—and, grabbing onto a cement column, he swings to the floor. He is swept back into the anonymity of the mob that is more than happy to reclaim him on firm ground. We are glad to forget the man on the rafters, and how he made us afraid. We don’t crave a good story as much as we used to.  That’s why, two hours later, we are huddled in The Diner, knees awkwardly pressed together under a tiny banquette table. A few years ago, we would have been ashamed to leave a warehouse party in favor of fries; tonight, it strikes us as audaciously hilarious.

Harvard Square’s Upper Crust Pizzeria, which closed in the wake of a company-wide legal scandal last November, will reopen as the renamed and partially worker-owned The Just Crust, ushering in a new era for employees of the embattled chain.Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, who represented Upper Crust employees in a labor abuse case against the management, spearheaded a fundraising effort to purchase the Harvard Square location when the pizza chain’s ten leases were auctioned off in December 2012.“It’s an exciting new way of supporting the workers we represent,” Liss-Riordan said. “I’m really hoping that we can make a success of it because I’m hoping this can serve as a model.”In 2009, the Department of Labor mandated the company to pay approximately $340,000 to a number of workers who claimed they were not paid overtime. Liss-Riordan, who is also a graduate of Harvard Law School, filed a lawsuit against The Upper Crust in July 2010, shortly after founder Jordan Tobins allegedly demanded that the employees pay back their overtime wages in order to keep their jobs.The case was eventually granted class-action status in July 2012, allowing Liss-Riordan to represent all of the aggrieved workers. When The Upper Crust filed for bankruptcy in October and the company closed its 10 storefronts, Liss-Riordan started thinking about a way to reopen the restaurants and further help the employees she had represented.
Haluk Ozek, owner of Monella Boutique on Brattle Street, partnered with Liss-Riordan to purchase the pizzeria at the auction. He said he immediately loved Liss-Riordan’s idea of giving ownership shares to the employees.“Because we’re a small business, we understand protecting the rights of workers,” Olek said. Ozek added that the new restaurant will focus more on providing superior food and service than on merely turning a profit.As a Harvard graduate and former resident of Brattle Street, Liss-Riordan said she hopes The Just Crust will be popular among students and become an important part of the Harvard community.“We are really, really excited about making this a great restaurant,” she said. “We’re hoping the Harvard community will be supportive of what we are doing there.”Liss-Riordan said she hopes for The Just Crust to open by March. She said she is also still involved in potentially acquiring other former Upper Crust locations.—Staff writer Nikki D. Erlick can be reached at nikkierlick@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: January 24, 2012, at 10:40 p.m.The Institute of Politics announced on Thursday a spring roster of residential and visiting fellows that includes prominent politicians, journalists, and political advisors.Former governor and presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, Jr., former U.S. Senator Timothy E. Wirth ’61, and CNN’s chief national correspondent John King will all spend several weeks on campus this semester as visiting fellows.In this role they are expected to interact with student groups, host discussions, and attend public policy classes on campus.“[The IOP] has always been the marquee political laboratory and discussion center,” King said. In his talks, King plans to highlight the changing American demographic.
The resident fellows will live on campus for the semester and lead weekly study groups during the spring term for undergraduates and members of the Harvard community.Former ambassador Karen Hughes, who also served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush, and former North Carolina governor Beverly “Bev” E. Perdue headline this class of resident fellows.“My study group is going to be wrapped around policy and entrepreneurship,” said Perdue who compared public policy to tech-startups. “Public policy is really policy entrepreneurship.”It is this approach to politics on which Perdue intends to focus during her time in Cambridge.Hughes, a political communications expert, will work with the Harvard community to plan for her fellowship.“I’m planning to meet with students during my orientation weeks to see where I could best share my expertise,” she said.Hughes and Perdue will be joined by John Murray, former deputy chief of staff to U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Stephen “Steve” Kerrigan, CEO of the 2012 Democratic National Convention Committee.Washington Post reporter Keith Richburg and Charles “Charlie” E. Cook, Jr. of The National Journal will contribute a journalistic perspective to the group.IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 noted that Richburg, a China correspondent for The Washington Post from 2009 to 2013, and Huntsman, who served as U.S. Ambassador to China for two years, bring with them knowledge of international relations with China, a topic which recently has generated heightened student interest.“We have heard from students all across campus with an interest in China,” said Grayson, who added that the IOP will likely host a forum with Richburg and Huntsman.

When I first excitedly told Harvard friends and classmates that I would be studying abroad in Buenos Aires for my fall 2012 semester, I did not quite get the upbeat “Bon Voyages!” I was expecting. Reactions were mostly negative. They ranged from: “How could you ever think to leave Harvard for a semester?” to “You can do that during the summer,” and finally the brutal, “The only people that go abroad during the year hate school or have no friends.” Almost every student seemed to think studying abroad during term time is, at best, unnecessary and, at worst, a waste.Harvard’s Office of International Education website offers statistics that reflect Harvard students’ overall aversion to studying abroad. The most recent <a href=""http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~oip/oip_stats-totals.html"">numbers, from the 2010-2011 school year, show that only 141 out of Harvard’s roughly 6,400 students went abroad during the school year. More do go abroad during the summer, but the total of Harvard students engaging in international experiences is still strikingly low. Even including summer, only 598 students had had an abroad experience. With the discouragement of classmates and these OIE numbers, I feared perhaps my choice to go to Argentina might be a bad one. I said a gloomy, “Hasta luego” to all.However, now that I have completed my fall semester in Buenos Aires and am preparing for my spring semester back on campus, I believe urgently and whole-heartedly that more Harvard students need to study internationally, especially during term time. The negative reaction and culture that surrounds studying abroad at Harvard is close-minded and shallow. Harvard students tend to get so obsessed with the Harvard world that they begin to have no interest in exploring the outside one. For such an international and diverse school, it seems wrong that so few of us stray outside our comfort zones.Of course, my time abroad was not perfect, and there were moments when I yearned for the sound of the Lowell bells instead of the incessant reggaeton blasting from the streets outside my window. But my experience taught me so many things in just a few months that I never would have learned in the classroom. Seeing thousands of Argentines banging pots and pans on the streets in opposition to President Cristina Kirchner showed me a protest movement very different than Occupy Wall Street. On a trip to Paraguay with my program, we visited a torture chamber created by dictator Alfredo Stroessner to hold anyone suspected of communist beliefs during Operation Condor. Listening to an old prisoner and touring the grounds where countless people had suffered taught me much more about the importance of democracy and freedom of thought than any Gen Ed ever could.Living in a completely different culture and having no choice but to speak in Spanish was both challenging and stimulating. I became stronger because of the difficult days when I could not communicate with my host family no matter how hard I tried. When our conversations did flow easily, I became more aware of politics and problems I had never known about before. I now am lucky enough to have friends who live in a completely different part of the world. Before I went to Argentina, “long distance” implied the Quad.
Studying abroad during the school year is the only way to combat the epidemic of FOMO (“fear of missing out”) that plagues this campus. Many students I talked to stressed that they were afraid to go abroad. They were nervous they would miss something gigantic or would return to find everyone had forgotten them. This is a silly and irrational obstacle. Leaving Harvard for a semester does not mean leaving Harvard forever. We do not have to be at every event, go to every party, or be in every Harvard-Yale Instagram photo.There are two tangible reasons why studying abroad during the year makes more sense than traveling over the summer. Firstly, a few months in a country is more enriching than a few weeks. It is only with committed time and constant interaction that one can feel deeply immersed in a place. When departure is only a few weeks away, it is hard to feel settled or at home. Secondly, studying abroad during the year is a better bet financially. Financial aid follows a student during term time or a year abroad. While there are funding sources to study during the summer, it is not guaranteed.Going away is perhaps not for everyone. Maybe you have a job or too many requirements for your concentration to take time away. You may have taken a gap year and thought that was enough. Or maybe you just don’t like to travel, which is perfectly understandable with the state of airplane food today. But there should still be more of us taking the chance to do something off the beaten path. Coming back to school now, I feel I have a very necessary perspective. I think less about all of my little Harvard complaints (Lamont café sandwiches, for example) and instead am excited to embrace all the opportunities that our school offers.Isabel H. Evans ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is an English concentrator living in Adams House.

About 45 members of the Allston-Brighton community gathered at noon on Wednesday at the construction site of the relocated Charlesview Residences housing complex to celebrate the progress of the ahead-of-schedule building project.Members of Charlesview’s Board of Directors unveiled the ceremonial cornerstone at the site, which is projected to be ready for residents to move in by this summer, ahead of the original October 2013 <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/28/charlesview-housing-complex-progresses/"">target date.The ceremony, which was shortened due to temperatures in the low teens, took place at 370 Western Ave., in an unfinished structure that will soon become the Josephine A. Fiorentino Community Center. The Center will serve as a gathering place for both residents of the new complex and the entire Allston-Brighton community.“This is really the beginning of many celebrations,” event organizer Jo-Ann Barbour said in an interview after the ceremony.Barbour, who is the executive director of Charlesview, Inc., said nearly all the residents of the existing Charlesview site have elected to move to the new, larger one, which will contain 240 apartments.
“Every resident that wants to move here will move here,” she said.Barbour also explained that the Community Center, which is named after the founder of Charlesview, Inc., will serve as a hub for the entire community and include a computer center, arts center, multipurpose rooms, and services such as college counseling and other family programs.The new property, which sits across the street from the Brighton Mills Shopping Center, is several blocks away from the old housing complex, adjacent to Harvard Business School. The old site’s location made it attractive to the University. Harvard obtained it from Charlesview’s Board of Directors in 2007. In exchange, Charlesview received the new site, which officials at Wednesday’s event praised for its location embedded in the Allston-Brighton community.But that agreement has provoked some anger and confusion among <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/7/9/charlesview-residents-reaction-divided/"">residents and members of the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/22/allston-charlesview-plans-too-vague/"">wider community.Construction on the new site—which is being co-developed by Charlesview, Inc., and The Community Builders, Inc., a nonprofit developer of mixed-income housing—began in May 2011. And on Wednesday, Barbour said that the unveiling was “one way to begin to mark this four-year journey.”She explained to the group that the original Charlesview Residences were founded by a group of religious organizations, whose names also appeared on the cornerstone unveiled Wednesday. Representatives from St. Anthony’s Catholic Church, Congregation Kadimah-Toras Moshe, and Community United Methodist Church, many of whom also sit on Charlesview’s Board of Directors, were present at the event and spoke to the crowd.Father Frank Glynn of St. Anthony’s, who is also chairman of the Board, voiced excitement about the Community Center’s construction.He described the Center as “a labor of love and...a commitment to the Allston-Brighton community.”He also extolled the warmth of the group that had gathered despite the crude state of the room and the freezing temperature.“I’ve been in many elegant pulpits in my time,” Glynn said. “And I’m really enjoying where I’m standing now.”

Harvard is in the process of reengaging the architect who originally had been tapped six years ago to design a new science complex in Allston the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/1/12/harvard-unveils-50-year-plan-for-allston/"">first time the plan was proposed.At a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting on Wednesday evening, Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey announced that Harvard is working to bring architect Stefan Behnisch back into the fold as the University restarts development on the planned hub of innovation and scientific work.Harvard originally filed plans for Allston development in 2007, proposing, among other projects, renovation of Barry’s Corner and a $1 billion science complex to be designed by Behnisch. After putting these plans on hold in wake of the 2009 economic downturn, the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/6/14/allston-development-science-2014/"">University announced that it would resume planning development in the area and filed a new draft of its <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/19/allston-plan-master-official/"">Institutional Master Plan for Allston development this past October. That draft was met with opposition from some residents, who <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/29/allston-letter-criticizes-plan/"">filed a letter criticizing what they characterized as ambiguous and problematic plans.And in Wednesday’s meeting, tensions ran high as many attendees called for swifter development and more details about the complex.Task Force member Brent C. Whelan asked about the inclusion of parking space and the scope of public access at the site, calling these factors “absolutely fundamental” to gauging the impact of development on the surrounding Allston community. Like other residents of Allston, he also voiced concern about the “complex and massive” need for transportation restructuring.
Casey, on the other hand, heralded Behnisch’s return to the project as a step forward that is, in fact, ahead of Harvard’s original schedule for resuming development on the science complex.“We continue to make progress even though [the completion of the project] is a little out of sight,” Casey said.Another point of contention at the meeting, which also had been debated at the Task Force’s previous meeting in December, was the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/19/relocation-plans-draw-criticism/"">proposed relocation of various landscaping, storage, and other University facilities from 219 Western Ave. to 28 Travis St.Residents said that they were concerned about how this development could impact the neighborhood’s atmosphere and cohesiveness.“It’s the kind of facility that just doesn’t mix well with a residential community,” said Bruce E. Houghton, a Task Force member and Allston resident.Speaking more broadly, Harry E. Mattison, another resident and member of the Task Force, said that Harvard needs to earn the trust of Allston residents.That sentiment was echoed by attendees who argued that Harvard has not been completely transparent in its planning.“What is it that’s being deliberated behind closed doors?” asked one man in the group.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.

It is a national truism: The United States government has money problems. Less recognized, however, is that federal research spending isn’t one of them. Unfortunately, funding for research at universities such as Harvard remains a prime target for slashing in the impending budget battle to resolve the coming sequestration cuts.Currently, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/30/sequestration-research-budget-cuts/"">Harvard receives approximately $656 million in federal sponsorship, or 16 percent of the university’s budget. The upcoming federal sequestration, postponed to March 1 by a patchwork New Year’s bill, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/30/sequestration-research-budget-cuts/"">threatens an 8.2 percent cut in non-defense discretionary spending, although it is unclear precisely how those cuts would fall. In some scenarios, Harvard could lose much more than 8.2 percent, or roughly $55 million, of its funding.That would be regrettable in multiple respects, not the least of which is that research and development spending is far from a long-term fiscal threat. Federal research and development <a href=""http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/fy2013/hist13pGDPTBL.pdf"">spending has fallen from 1.08 percent of GDP in 2003 to 0.90 percent in 2012, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, during a ten-year period when <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf"">total federal outlays rose from 19.7 percent of GDP to over 24 percent by 2012.The logic of sequestration is to present a default alternative detrimental enough to spur a deal for averting it. However, a bipartisan failure to solve the core issues facing long-run U.S. budgets—entitlement spending (especially health-care related) in an <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/05/news/economy/national_debt_spending/index.htm"">upward tailspin; historically low and inefficient <a href=""http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/tax-reform/news/2011/06/10/9751/ten-charts-that-prove-the-united-states-is-a-low-tax-country/"">revenue collection; a Brobdingnagian <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/23/news/la-ol-ol-defense-budget-size-and-potential-for-cuts-20121023"">defense budget yet to be reined in—has left worthy discretionary programs, like Harvard’s R&amp;D, on the Congressional chopping block. That is a sad, Faustian bargain.Research and development is an especially potent example of Congressional myopia. While costly in the short run, research is an essential driver of long-term economic growth. According to a study <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~chadj/SourcesAER2002.pdf"">published in the American Economic Review, “increased research intensity” in the United States (plus four other developed countries examined) accounts for approximately half of all economic growth from 1950 to 1993. And it has long been acknowledged that an economy cannot rely solely on private actors for optimal R&amp;D investment. As Nobel laureate economist Kenneth Arrow <a href=""http://www.nber.org/chapters/c2144.pdf"">explained over fifty years ago, “We expect a free enterprise economy to underinvest in invention and research (as compared with an ideal) because it is risky, because the product can be appropriated only to a limited extent, and because of increasing returns in use.” Perhaps most importantly, he noted, “This underinvestment will be greater for more basic research.”
Basic research, as opposed to applied research or development, may be the most crucial in the long term, as it fuels our general advancement of knowledge, yet it operates farthest from the store shelf or the patent office. The need for federal funding is evident empirically. <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDsQFjAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aau.edu%2FWorkArea%2FDownloadAsset.aspx%3Fid%3D10828&amp;ei=_ksAUdD4OJKo0AHQ8YD4BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8SOXzGN1sh2MhB8TirkfpvtWizQ"">Federal contributions accounted for only 26 percent of total R&amp;D spending in 2008 but funded 57 percent of basic research. In recent months, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/3/sequestration-fiscal-deal-spending/"">President Faust has said that Harvard might look to private sources to supplant its federal funding; do not expect replacements to fill the gaps in basic research.Thus far, the U.S. government has failed to value long-term economic concerns over short-term internecine squabbling. We sincerely hope that a fresh deal can be reached by the end of February: one that attacks economic prosperity’s true threats and leaves its engines of growth unmarred—not the other way around.

Last year, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/blog/the-back-page/article/2012/2/12/harvard-knicks-lin-all-star-game/"">it took some work, but eventually Jeremy Lin ’10 made the Rookie-Sophomore Challenge at the 2012 All-Star Weekend. This year, expectations were higher as many thought Lin might make the weekend’s main event—Sunday night’s All-Star Game, featuring the best and brightest from both NBA conferences. The anticipation was enhanced by the fact that this season’s festivities are taking place in his team’s home arena in Houston, Tex. But the Harvard alum just missed out on collecting enough fan votes to start in the Game, meaning his only remaining option was to hope that the NBA coaches would select him as an all-star reserve. On Thursday afternoon, live on TNT, the coaches’ choices were revealed. Lin did not make the team.
The lack of inclusion did not come as a surprise to most, who considered the fan’s vote to be his only real shot at collecting a spot on the squad during to an up-and-down season for the third-year guard. Even Lin, after a recent loss to the Dallas Mavericks, responded with a simple “Uh, no” when asked whether he felt he should make the Western Conference team.
While Lin may not have made the cut, fellow Rocket and backcourt-mate James Harden did. Harden will play with former teammates and Oklahoma City Thunder members Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook when the games begin on Feb. 17.

The Harvard Theological Review continues to hold off on publishing the long-awaited article on the so-called “Gospel of Jesus’s Wife,” <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/18/fragment-jesus-wife-harvard/"">a scrap of papyrus that if authenticated would provide evidence that some early Christians believed Jesus was married.The article was originally slated to be printed in the publication’s January 2013 edition, but was held as scientific testing of the controversial papyrus continued.First announced at a September conference in Rome by Harvard Divinity School professor Karen L. King, the papyrus fragment contains a Coptic phrase that translates to “Jesus said to them, my wife...”Since then, the Vatican and academics have denounced the artifact as a forgery, pointing to the grammatical similarities between the fragment and another ancient document, the gnostic Gospel of Thomas. These similarities, scholars argue, suggest that the papyrus was not written in the fourth century.According to Kathryn Dodgson, director of communications at HDS, the publication is waiting to print King’s article while the papyrus undergoes scientific analysis.
Once she receives the results of that analysis, King will incorporate them into the article for the Harvard Theological Review, Dodgson wrote in an email.Currently analysts are testing the ink on the fragment to confirm that it dates from the fourth century like the papyrus itself, which has already been tested.King could not be reached for comment on this article.Scholars said that even if the scientific analysis confirms the ink’s age, questions about the authenticity of the artifact may remain.Gregory E. Sterling, dean of Yale Divinity School, said problems arise from the fact that little is known about the circumstances of the fragment’s discovery. Because the papyrus comes from the collections of an anonymous donor, rather than from an archaeological dig, authentication is more difficult, he said.Other scholars pointed out similarities between King’s papyrus and the Gospel of Thomas.“It really is unbelievably close to the Gospel of Thomas,” said Mark S. Goodacre, an associate professor at Duke University and an expert on early Christian texts. “We’re talking about literally every word, with a few gender changes.”Janet A. Timbie, an expert in Coptic language and literature who teaches at the Catholic University of America, said that although the two texts are extremely similar, their resemblance does not necessarily disprove the fragment’s authenticity because “people often rework material in the ancient world.”Even so, Timbie said she thought the text was likely faked.Scholars and King agree that even if the academic community does eventually accept the authenticity of the fragment, because it comes from the fourth century the papyrus would not give definitive information about what Jesus did in his time.“It would tell us something about the fourth century, but not about the first century,” said Sterling. “This just shows how people later thought about this.”—Staff writer John P.

When Stephen Lassonde takes the helm of the Office of Student Life in March, he will encounter issues similar to many he faced in his previous posts, including a changing residential environment and a disciplinary system that many have described as misguided.Lassonde, deputy dean of the college at Brown, was<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/14/student-life-dean-brown/""> named Harvard College’s new dean of student life last week. He brings with him over 20 years of experience as an administrator and educator at other Ivy League institutions.At Brown, Lassonde enhanced the undergraduate advising system and reformed the deliberative procedures of the school’s Committee on Academic Standing.“Over the past five and a half years, [Lassonde] has worked tirelessly to improve the quality of the academic support we offer to Brown faculty and students,” wrote Katherine Bergeron, dean of the college at Brown, in an email announcing Lassonde’s departure from the school.Lassonde will take on a different set of responsibilities as Harvard’s dean of student life. In the position, he will oversee matters related to undergraduates’ lives outside of the classroom, an experience largely defined by their House affiliation.
Lassonde comes to the College during a critical time of transformation for the House system as the University <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/3/quincy-renewal-groundbreaking-construction/"">continues planned renovation to Harvard’s Houses that began last year.But Lassonde is no stranger to the challenges posed by House renewal. Prior to assuming his current position at Brown in 2007, Lassonde spent 14 years at Yale as a history lecturer and dean of Calhoun College, one of Yale’s 12 residential colleges. During his tenure at Calhoun, Yale embarked on a renovation of all of its residential colleges.“I was struck with the similarity in the process to Yale,” Lassonde said.Just as at Harvard, student input fueled plans for the redesigned buildings, Lassonde said. And Yale administrators also grappled with the accessibility of common spaces in the colleges—a common complaint among Harvard undergraduates.“He definitely has very relevant experience, especially with House renewal,” said Danny P. Bicknell ’13, former Undergraduate Council president who served on the search committee that hired Lassonde.In addition, Bicknell said that Lassonde has experience in issues of academic integrity, a pertinent matter following the recent investigation of cheating in the course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”As many criticize the Administrative Board, Harvard’s disciplinary body, for being insensitive to students’ perspectives, Bicknell said that Lassonde hopes to make the process “supportive of students.”One of Lassonde’s greatest pushes at Brown was to bridge the gap between administrators and students. Lassonde held office hours in non-traditional locations such as gyms where students were already congregated.“He can lead the OSL to be a more accessible office, reenvision it, revitalize it, especially because it’s been through a lot of turnovers,” Bicknell said.Tara Raghuveer ’14, president of the UC, was also involved in the selection process.“I think Dean Lassonde will bring a lot of necessary leadership and perspective and move the OSL to a great direction,” Raghuveer said. “[He’ll be an] advocate for students.”At a place like Harvard, Lassonde said, students may arrive with feelings of inadequacy.“It is critical that we help our students overcome that feeling as soon as possible by making clear how we can help them and to respond in a timely way,” Lassonde wrote in an emailed statement.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Elizabeth S.

While the saying may be “home sweet home,” the return back to Houston was anything but sweet for Jeremy Lin’s Rockets. The squad picked up its eighth loss in nine games, falling to the Denver Nuggets, 105-95.
The combination of a low shooting percentage and turnovers continued to plague Houston, as it shot under 45 percent from the field and tallied 23 turnovers, 17 of which came from its starting unit. Those 23 mistakes proved especially costly for the Rockets, as Denver was able to convert them into easy buckets. The Nuggets totaled 28 points off turnovers on the night, 26.7 percent of their total offensive output.
“[Denver] got some run-outs when we weren't getting back on defense,” Houston coach Kevin McHale said. “It's been like that for a while. It just snowballs with us…We’re not able to pull ourselves out of those minor tailspins.”
In 24 minutes of playing time, Lin put up nine points on three-of-seven shooting, along with three assists and a single rebound. It was the second straight game that Lin played less than 25 minutes, a marked difference from his usual thirty-plus minutes on the floor.
Wednesday night’s game was notable for two other reasons though, both of which involved reaching major milestones—Nuggets guard and veteran Andre Iguodala reached 10,000 career points while his coach, George Karl, notched his 1,000th win as a head coach.
Lin’s team will have one night off before heading back on the road to face the struggling New Orleans Hornets on Friday. As the Portland Trail Blazers won their contest on Wednesday, the Rockets are back in a gridlock for the eighth and final playoff position in the Western Conference.

The Harvard men’s tennis team will depart the cold Cambridge weather for Norman, Okla. to join Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and Memphis in the ITA Kick-Off this weekend.The No. 28 Crimson will first take on the No. 30 Fighting Irish on Friday, and either the No. 8 Sooners or the No. 31 Tigers on Saturday, depending on the results of the first match.“All four teams in this tournament are some of the top teams in the nation,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “Every match is going to be a battle, so you can’t really take anything for granted at this point.”Harvard and Notre Dame (2-1) will face off for the second time this season, with the first coming in the fall at the Tribe Invitational. The Fighting Irish came out on top in the tournament, winning seven of eight singles matches against the Crimson and taking two of the three doubles matches as well.Notre Dame opened up its dual match season with a pair of 7-0 wins, but fell earlier this week to No. 37 Northwestern in a 4-3 decision.
The Fighting Irish are led by junior Greg Andrews, who has compiled a 10-5 record on the year and is 3-0 at the No. 1 position. As the Big East Player of the Year last season, Andrews also earned a spot in the 2012 NCAA Singles Championship.Another top competitor for Notre Dame is senior Blas Moros, who has posted a perfect 12-0 record dating back to the fall campaign.After taking on the Fighting Irish, Harvard will resume competition the next day against either Oklahoma or Memphis. While the Tigers sit just three spots behind Harvard in the national poll, the Sooners have played their way to a top-10 ranking.“Oklahoma is very good,” co-captain Andy Nguyen said. “If we beat Notre Dame, we’ll take every match as a learning experience and hopefully we can do our best against [the Sooners].”Oklahoma (1-0) took down Wichita State earlier this week, winning all nine matches and dropping only three sets.Senior Costin Paval has proved to be a formidable opponent over the course of his career as a Sooner. Paval was named the ITA preseason No. 6 player in the nation and he has partnered with sophomore Dane Webb to make up the country’s No. 1 doubles squad.Memphis (1-0), the Crimson’s other potential opponent, came out on top, 6-1, in its last outing against No. 47 Michigan State.Sophomore Connor Glennon plays at the No. 1 position for the Tigers. The reigning C-USA Co-Freshman of the Year, Glennon put together a 1-3 record this fall against ranked opponents, but managed to pull out a three-set victory against the Spartans.Harvard’s lineup is still in flux as a minor groin injury to sophomore Denis Nguyen has made him questionable to play. If Nguyen is forced to sit, Chaudhuri will play at the No. 1 position with sophomore Alex Steinroeder, freshman Nicky Hu and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster filling out the top spots behind him.The Crimson dominated its opponents this past weekend at the Harvard Winter Invite. Competing against Boston College, Marist, and Fordham, Harvard players took part in 32 matches and claimed victory in 29 of them.

Apparently the Undergraduate Council referendum to divest from fossil fuels is impossible, and many Harvard students don’t do math. At least, that is what a recent Wall Street Journal opinion <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324640104578161593492943144.html"">article “Harvard Needs Remedial Energy Math” implies. According to Robert Bryce, Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the numerous energy experts he cites, alternative energy, such as wind and solar, can never be plentiful enough to keep pace with the world’s increased energy usage (as much as 121 percent since the 1980s). Bryce says the 72 percent of voting undergrads who chose to divest from fossil fuels did not look at the numbers behind our energy needs. His point is clear: We need fossil fuels.At least that is what I think he was trying to say; all the fractions kept on confusing me. But beneath all the statistics, Bryce might be onto something—maybe we were not looking too closely when we voted to divest from fossil fuels.Or maybe I am using the communal we here unjustly. Maybe I am the only one who didn’t spend much time when I voted on the measure. I did not do any research. I did not pull out my calculator, my abacus, or my smart friend who can do math in his head. I did not even read the whole measure; I only skimmed the summary of the ballot (perhaps Bryce should write an op-ed about how we don’t read). I saw “fossil fuel” and I voted as any student who recycles when convenient has been conditioned to: in favor of divestment.I was proud of myself for doing my 10-second part to save the environment and celebrated with a half dozen paper cups filled with dining hall coffee. You’re welcome, ice caps. I did not think twice about the consequence of my vote or if divestment was even possible. I trusted that since I voted against evil, against fossil fuels, I had done right.Supporting environmentalism, the green movement, and divestment has become the norm, a social law that we obey at the risk of destroying the planet and upsetting Prius owners. We support them because we are supposed to, because green is good, oil is bad, four legs good and two legs bad. We are programmed to support the green movement without thinking.
Our votes have consequences, even if we refuse to think about them. In this case the administration chose to ignore our mandate, but this is not always the case. Imagine if members of Congress didn’t think when voting on health care or economic policy, ignored the substance of a bill, and only looked at trigger words that told them how they should vote. That would lead to gridlock and government immobility. We expect our leaders to make informed decisions. There is no reason we shouldn’t hold ourselves to that same high standard.It’s not really our fault. We have been programmed to take short cuts, skim readings, and multitask. Why shouldn’t we? We barely have enough time to sleep as it is. So why should we take the time to research every country’s energy consumption or study the background of every UC candidate? That time could be spent sleeping or perhaps reading the news while listening to a lecture while doing Zumba.Yet, we (just me again?) could have spent a little more than two minutes voting on the UC ballot. Skimming referenda and voting for friends and people with catchy names seems like a slap in the face to those students who invested months working on their campaigns and drafting measures. We could spend a little more time looking into it.If you won’t do it for them do it for yourself. We have a reputation to uphold and not the Elle Woods “Legally Blonde” one. We look bad when we don’t think. It’s embarrassing when people like Bryce chide us in the Wall Street Journal.Worst of all, most of us cannot even defend our position. We cannot support our decision, we have no facts, have done no research, and apparently don’t do math. The debate team should be horrified. We need stronger defenses than “I had a good feeling about this one,” “The sentence I skimmed had a nice font,” and “Eenie meenie moe never fails.” We have to admit that yes, maybe we could have done a little more research, or at the very least given the measure some thoughtful consideration.Maybe Bryce is wrong, maybe divestment is completely possible, and he needs to redo his own math. However, we will never know unless we look into it ourselves. It is unreasonable of the student body to expect the administration to make drastic changes without fully understanding or even considering the implications of what we are asking it to do.Nicole J. Levin ’15, a Crimson FM executive, is a history and literature concentrator in Dunster House.

Speaking at a panel in the Science Center on Tuesday about careers in sports management, former Crimson pitcher <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/4/23/athlete-of-the-week-ben-crockett/"">William “Ben” Crockett ’02 paused for a long moment before answering a question about his days working as a front office intern with the Boston Red Sox.Crockett leaned back in his chair, stroked his temple, and finally said, “In my first year as an intern, I started in February, and I had my first day off during the All-Star break in July. Working 100-hour weeks was the norm with a stipend that, at the time, was below minimum wage.”But Crockett said that the long hours of his job were worthwhile and ultimately rewarding. Today, he is Director of Player Development for the Red Sox.Crockett was joined on the Harvard Alumni Association-sponsored panel by three other alumni, all of whom have also parlayed successful Harvard athletic careers into new professional jobs in the world of sports management.Panelist and former Crimson shortstop Edwin “Ed” M. Durso ’75, now the executive vice president of ESPN, echoed Crockett’s comments about the work ethic required to move up in the industry.
“Where I worked, 100-hour weeks were expected,” Durso said. “If you didn’t do that, they’d pick up the phone and ask ‘Where’s the next person in line?’”Panelists also characterized sports management as an industry in which athletic excellence need not be a prerequisite for employment. All of them told stories about their own winding paths to post-college sports management careers.Originally drafted by the Red Sox in the tenth round in 2001, Crockett chose to return to Harvard for his senior year and was then drafted in the third round by the Colorado Rockies in 2002. Crockett was a minor league shortstop for the Rockies’ farm affiliates for four years, logging starts for twelve different teams and making a AAA appearance in 2005. After being released in 2006, Crockett played independent ball before taking an internship with the Red Sox in 2007.Durso—who entered the sports world first as a television reporter but got his first job with the Red Sox as a lawyer—also said there is not just one way to get into sports. Pointing out that only one person can reach the privileged positions of owner or general manager, Durso advised students not to narrow their focus and instead follow their passions to get a job in the industry.Panelist <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/end-of-an-era-angela-ruggiero/"">Angela M. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/end-of-an-era-angela-ruggiero/"">Ruggiero ’02, a four-time Olympic medalist who was on the Olympic women’s hockey team as a high school teenager, now works on the International Olympic Committee’s Athletes’ Association. Recalling what she described as a “pack mentality” at Harvard in thinking about post-college employment, Ruggiero encouraged students to pursue their passions instead of the careers of others.“One thing I’ve tried to do my entire life, both as an athlete and then professionally in business, is trust myself,” Ruggerio said. “People have been telling me my entire life to do things, but I learned to listen to myself.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

For me, as for many, my high school years were spent in preparation for acceptance into a prestigious university. Surrounded by students with similar goals and impressive qualifications, stress became a ritual part of my daily life. The day I received the letter saying that I was accepted into Harvard, however, I felt as if all my stress had suddenly dissipated. Little did I know of the pressures that I would encounter upon walking through those iron gates.On the day of my freshman convocation, Dean Michael D. Smith stood in front of the Class of 2015 and issued a powerful phrase: “Don’t compare, connect.” While I did not recognize it at the time, his speech undoubtedly held the typical Harvard student in mind—competitive, and obsessed with perfection. With this simple, three-word truth, therefore, Dean Smith addressed a critical cause of Harvard’s problem with stress—the “Type A” personality.The Type A personality refers to those individuals with a high level of ambition and drive, qualities often branding them with the terms “over-achievers” or “workaholics.” According to studies by the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2012/08/30/stress-a-type-a-personality-may-boost-stroke-risk"">Type A personalities are at an increased risk for strokes due to higher propensities for stress. That is to say, stress is an inexorable counterpart for this personality type.Nowadays, stress among college students has literally become nearly as <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-10/stress-takes-its-toll-on-college-students"">common as back pain or allergies. Combine this with the fact that Newsweek <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/most-stressful-colleges-college-rankings_n_1832866.html"">ranks Harvard as the fourth most stressful university in the country, and you are hard pressed to find a student on campus that is not inundated with some sort of academic or social pressure. In a sea of the best and brightest, competition becomes inevitable amongst students on our campus.Some students, and even a Crimson <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/17/mental-health-harvard/"">staff editorial, have called attention to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/12/mental-health-time-off/"">flaws in the University Health Services’ response to stress and mental health. In addition, in a three-part article in The Crimson on <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/14/mental-health-harvard/"">mental health published this past December, students expressed their frustration with the Harvard’s perfectionist culture, maintaining that constant exposure to the exceptional achievements of their peers leads to general “feelings of inadequacy.”
But perhaps the root of this issue also lies with the students themselves and their search for unattainable perfection.On the surface, there may seem to be a quick fix for the problem at hand—students should avoid hyper-focusing on their intelligence or capability to withstand academic rigor in comparison to that of others. The unfortunate truth, however, is that convincing Type A students in a Type A environment to shed feelings of inadequacy is essentially asking them to reverse an inherent character trait. In fact, it is likely that this very desire to overachieve has allowed Harvard students to succeed thus far.Because Harvard students are competitive by nature, however, they must in turn develop healthy means of coping with the inevitable stressors they encounter here on campus.According to Helpguide.org, an online non-profit resource that provides mental health advice, the four critical <a href=""http://www.helpguide.org/mental/stress_management_relief_coping.htm"">methods of coping with stress are to avoid, alter, accept, or adapt to the stressor. Since it is virtually implausible to either avoid or alter Harvard’s ultra-competitive environment, we as students are left with two options: to accept the reality of this unhealthy form of competition, or to adapt by changing our perspective altogether.Instead of convincing ourselves, for instance, of the need to match or outperform our peers, we must recognize that, as Harvard students, we are fortunate enough to have some of the most innovative and intelligent minds at our fingertips. While Type A personalities, therefore, may still view the student next to them as competition, they can also choose to view him or her as a resource to assist their own progress and success.Lastly, perhaps the best way to adapt to the Harvard environment is to adjust our notion of what it means to be successful and ensure that we are not always falling short of our own impossible standards. In the closing of The Crimson’s series on mental health, for instance, one student, going by the name of Christine, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/14/mental-health-harvard/"">calls for her peers to “embrace the reality that no one is perfect” and “remember that everyone falls short of perfection.""In track and field, even though a runner may not win the race, they can still achieve a “P.B.,” or “personal best.” Whether or not they receive a first place medal, therefore, running a P.B. is still an indication of success. In this same way, we must try to define our personal best and use this as our standard for achievement.Granted, feelings of incompetence will resurface throughout our time at Harvard, and it is important not only to ask for help, but also to be comfortable doing so whenever we feel overwhelmed. As the new semester approaches, however, we must try to remember that we cannot do better than our best and that our best is more than enough. With this notion in mind, we can emerge from the stress of this university and call ourselves what we are, a success.Aria N. Bendix, ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Quincy House.

Junior captain Adabelle Ekechukwu wasted no time in letting her competitors know that she is a force to be reckoned with in 2013.Ekechukwu’s performance in the weight throw ring at Gordon Indoor Track on Saturday not only earned her first place in the event, but also shattered her own school record by over 0.3 meters. With a mark of 19.22 meters, the junior, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, became the first woman in Harvard history to eclipse 19 meters in the weight throw.“I'm happy with how I opened up,” Ekechukwu said. “I've been chasing a certain distance for a while, and it's nice seeing myself getting closer to my goal…. [The Harvard Challenge] was like reaching a checkpoint in the grander scheme of things.”But Ekechukwu was not the only athlete on her squad to kick off the season in a strong fashion. In total, the Crimson men and women set five school records at the Harvard Challenge en route to a pair of team victories over Army, Northeastern, Brown, MIT, and Williams. The Harvard men finished with 78.5 points while the women’s team scored 112.5 on the day.“I think [breaking five school records] says a lot about what’s to come,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “This early in the year, we’re still knocking out the roster and working out some kinks, so I really think this is just a taste of what’s to come. I could see that record board having to do a pretty major facelift by the time the year’s done.”
On the women’s side, sophomore middle distance runner Molly Renfer joined Ekechukwu in earning a spot in the record books. Renfer cruised to a victory in the 1000-meter run with a program-best time of 2:49.06. Her nearest competitor, the Black Knight’s Jennifer Comfort, finished nearly four seconds later, allowing Renfer to pick up seven team points for Harvard.Junior Morgan Kelly, who was recently named the women’s cross country captain for next season, took home first place in the 3000-meter run, just missing the 10-minute mark with a finish of 10:01.15. Kelly’s cross country teammate, sophomore Viviana Hanley, also earned points in the 3000 by finishing in fourth place at the season opener.Perhaps the most impressive event for the women’s team was the 500-meter run, in which sophomores Erika Veidis and Gabrielle Scott as well as freshman Autumne Franklin turned in a 1-2-3 finish. Veidis led the way for the Crimson by breaking the school record in the event with a time of 1:13.28.“Right from the gun, it was very clear that the Harvard women were taking control of the race,” Saretsky said. “Erika had a fantastic finish to get under that school record. But the most exciting part is that [the 500-meter run] is not even her primary event, she’s more of an 800 runner, so I think that she’ll get even stronger as the distance goes up.”Not to be outdone by her throwing and middle distance counterparts, sophomore sprinter Danielle Barbian set the school record in the preliminary heat of the 60-meter dash. Barbian ran a time of 7.61 seconds in the preliminaries and went on to win the event with a 7.70 in the final heat.On the men’s side, the Harvard throwers picked up right where they left off in the 2012 season. Junior Dustin Brode teamed up with sophomores Ben Glauser and Igor Liokumovich to finish 1-2-3 in the shot put and 1-2-4 in the weight throw. Brode took home the top spot in the former with a hurl of 17.09 meters, and Glauser took the helm in the weight throw with a 18.62-meter toss.“Coach [Andrew] Dubs has done a phenomenal job with our throwers,” Saretsky said. “Sometimes it’s a more challenging coaching task to take a group that has had success and make them even more successful. But that group has bought it; they believe in the training that they’re doing.”Dubs, who replaced Cathrine Eriksen as the Crimson’s throwing coach this season, is also earning praise from his athletes.“Coach Dubs has been amazing,” Ekechukwu said. “He had a great college career and is so easy to talk to, so it's been easier understanding and trusting the advice he gives. I've had two years to learn the fundamentals, but I'm really glad he's here now to help make things click.”Sophomore Jarvis Harris also had a noteworthy outing on Saturday, capturing two event titles with a pair of personal-best marks. Harris broke the school record that he set as a freshman in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.02 seconds. The Ama, La. native then went on to win the triple jump with a leap of 14.8 meters, 0.65 meters farther than the event’s second-place finisher.“Jarvis had a great day,” Saretsky said. “There are definitely things he knows he can improve on and things he can clean up, but I’m expecting some great things from Jarvis. I think it’s going to be a very exciting year for him.”—Staff writer Dominic Martinez can be reached at dmartinez@college.harvard.edu.

In a flu season that has seen the declaration of a public health emergency in Boston in response to an unsually large number of cases in the city, members of the Harvard community have clamored to get vaccinated against the virus.Though Harvard has not yet seen an outbreak of the flu on campus, University Health Services has taken steps to keep students healthy this flu season.At its most recent clinic on Jan. 15, UHS vaccinated 500 people. In total, UHS has vaccinated 13,000 people since the end of August, according to UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker.UHS held weekly vaccination clinics for most of the fall semester, and during winter break Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent students an email encouraging them to get vaccinated before returning to campus and noting that UHS had a “limited supply” of the vaccine.UHS also plans to offer another vaccination clinic on Monday, Jan. 28. Although Baker confirmed that there will be a limited supply of vaccinations at the clinic, she did not specify the number of vaccines that would be available.
The limited supply of vaccine at Harvard has been felt by the greater Boston community as well. Shortages have been reported throughout the city since Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino declared a state of emergency on Jan. 9 in response to the 700 flu confirmed cases in the city since the start of October. In comparison, there were just 70 flu cases confirmed in the entire year of 2011.Although this flu season has been especially intense and peaked earlier than usual in Boston, it may not necessarily be a so-called “outbreak,” according to Thomas J. Sandora, assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.Even so, Sandora emphasized the importance of getting the flu vaccine, in addition to taking other preventive measures such as hand-washing and staying away from others when sick—especially on a college campus where students live in close quarters and infectious diseases may spread more easily.“The vaccine is the best thing we have to protect you against getting the flu,” Sandora said.Joshua R. Wortzel ’13 received the vaccine at the UHS clinic on Jan. 15 after trying unsuccessfully to get vaccinated at CVS, which he had been told had exhausted its supply. Wortzel said he arrived at the UHS clinic a few minutes early, not anticipating a large crowd. By the time Wortzel arrived, however, the line—which started on the second floor of UHS in Holyoke Center—extended all the way to the front foyer on the ground level. By the time he had reached the second floor, he said he could see through the window that the queue had snaked out the building and around the block near the Garage.“People were certainly pretty concerned about this,” Wortzel said. “They were willing to wait in a really long line.”Wortzel said he was satisfied with his experience at the clinic. He noted, however, that some of the officials at UHS appeared to be surprised by the size of the turnout.And some Harvard affiliates in line may not have even needed the vaccine. Wortzel said several students in line—himself included—got vaccinated that day even though were not sure whether or not they had already received the vaccine at a previous doctor’s visit.—Staff writer Madeline R. Conway can be reached at mconway@college.harvard.edu.

After starting off the season with its first shutout opener since 2010, a 7-0 blanking of Cleveland State University, the Harvard women’s tennis team returns to the court this weekend with matchups against William and Mary (3-1) on Friday and Kansas State (0-0) on Sunday.“We’ve only been practicing about two weeks so it’s been really early but everyone is doing a great job on court,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “Right now we need to just get some more matches under our belts. We’ve been practicing hard and the next phase is match play. Once we have that under our belts, we should be ready to move forward and improve.”Last year, the Crimson snapped a 19-match losing streak to the Tribe with a 5-2 victory. This year, the Tribe come in after its most impressive victory of the season, a 4-3 comeback victory over 19th-ranked Mississippi. William and Mary’s only loss this season came to No. 3 Duke. Harvard and Kansas State have never played each other. Green expects both teams to provide stiff tests for the Crimson.“Overall, we always try to play a strong schedule and January, February, and March to prepare us for the Ivy season in April,” Green said. “Our goals are to improve over the next few months so that we can be prepared and compete for the Ivy title in April and hopefully compete at the NCAA tournament at the end of the season.”After dealing with sickness and injuries, the team has constantly adjusted its doubles teams to fit changing lineups. The team has accumulated a 23-13 total record in doubles through the flux at the position. However, the team’s most successful doubles team—co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amy He—have only played four matches together, posting a 4-0 record.
Co-captain Hideko Tachibana, who has been a fixture on the team’s No. 1 doubles team all semester and plays top line for the team in singles, said that the team has focused on establishing rhythm with a rotating lineup.“The focus has been the doubles in practice,” Tachibana said. “We’ve tried a lot of different combinations and we’ve been rotating people in and out. In this next match, we will have a completely different lineup than we’ve had in the past.”Amidst all the turnover—which includes four freshmen who all played in the Crimson’s top six against Cleveland State—Green said that Norton and Tachibana have been key in steadying the team and keeping it focused on its goals, which include winning the Ivy League title.“Our captains have been fabulous this season,” Green said. “It’s their second season being co-captains and they have learned a lot from their first season as co-captains and we are very fortunate to have them. It’s their last year and we’re going to make the most of it. They’ve taken every day to make sure that they leave a long-lasting legacy for our tennis program.”Tachibana said that the freshmen have been key to the team’s early success. According to the Austin, Texas native, the culture around the team has changed—with the focus more on the final results instead of how the team plays during the match.“I would say that there is a lot desire to win this year,” Tachibana said. “Usually in team meetings, we talk about our goals and this year we are more focused on outcome goals whereas last year it was more focused on performance goals. Everyone is really focused on the Ivy League title and that’s really great to see.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.January 20, 1910: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1910/1/20/original-college-wall-discovered-pin-the/"">Original College Wall DiscoveredIn the southeastward course of the excavations for the Cambridge subway, the southwest corner of the original ""Harvard College,"" built in 1638, has been unearthed. On December 8, 1909, about 40 feet of the wall of Edward Goffe's House, which stood on an adjoining lot, was discovered a little to the west of Wadsworth House, running parallel with the street. The piece just discovered is about 40 yards below Wadsworth House.The corner is almost directly opposite the entrance to Holyoke House, and is in a perfect state of preservation. It is constructed of field stones. The wall running to the east appears to extend under the sidewalk around the ""College Yard."" The upper courses of both walls leading from the corner were removed years ago when the water mains were installed along Massachusetts avenue.January 26, 1942: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1942/1/26/yale-grad-taken-for-nazi-agent/"">Yale Grad Taken For Nazi Agent Photoing Widener
Proof of Harvard's alertness in matters of defense was afforded Saturday by the apprehension of a suspicious-looking character in the act of taking a picture of Widener with a foreign camera. Accused of being a Nazi agent, the culprit was taken into custody by the Yard Cops.Further quizzing by Arthur Wild '26, head of the University News Office, exonerated the captive of foreign connections, however. He turned out to be a harmless Yale grad seeing the sights.<!--more-->January 22, 1948: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1948/1/22/icy-torrents-and-collapsible-roofs-give/"">Icy Torrents and Collapsible Roofs Give Examination Blues New ThemeUncounted bruised rumps and one crushed roof joined the weather's victim list yesterday in the watery aftermath of the worst ice and snow blitz to hit Cambridge in a generation.The storm has bombarded the area with a weight of 45 pounds per square foot, according to an estimate of the Blue Hills Observatory of Harvard, splitting the roof of Hollis Hall yesterday, and sending ice water cascading down the four story stair well.Waste paper baskets proved ineffective in stemming the cold shouldered flood as it ripped away ceilings and laid a slippery coat down Hollis stairs.Friday, January 24, 1958: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1958/1/24/freshman-applicants-increase-20-per-cent/"">Freshman Applicants Increase 20 PercentApplications for admission to next year's Freshman class have increased approximately twenty per cent over last year, David D.

They are given an allotment of 80 cents per day, which was ample in the days when hamburgers were 30 cents, cottage cheese a nickel, and ice cream and fruit, only a dime.But now, the allotment has stayed the same, but most of the prices have gone up five cents per item. Hamburgers now cost 35 cents, and the Cliffies who like two (without the caloric rolls, of course,) will just have to skip the salad, or pay the extra in cash.—Compiled by Rebecca D. Robbins

When Harvard Medical School genetics professor George M. Church was interviewed by the German magazine Der Spiegel about his new book, he had no idea that a misinterpretation of something he said would set off a worldwide media firestorm.While explaining the process by which scientists might one day clone a Neanderthal, a now-extinct sub-species closely related to the modern human, he mentioned that a human surrogate would need to be employed to carry it to term. In the book that Church cowrote with science author Ed Regis, “Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves,” he remarked that the surrogate would have to be an “extremely adventurous female human.”Dozens of news outlets around the world misinterpreted the exchange as an indication that Church was actively looking for such a human and intended to perform the cloning procedure, when in reality he was proposing a hypothetical method to clone a Neanderthal. A <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265402/Adventurous-human-woman-wanted-birth-Neanderthal-man-Harvard-professor.html"">headline from the United Kingdom’s Daily Mail, for example, read, “Wanted:’Adventurous woman’ to give birth to Neanderthal man—Harvard professor seeks mother for cloned cave baby.”But cloning a Neanderthal was always only a theoretical possibility, Church said during an interview with The Crimson. His description of the process in both his book and the interview with Der Spiegel was far more complicated and speculative than many outlets indicated in their publications.“It was a part of a very long and nuanced discussion which you can only have in a book,” Church said. “You can’t have it in a soundbite.”
Since the interview, Church has been contacted by many people who object to the concept of cloning, as well as women offering themselves as surrogates for the hypothetical operation.“They’re still contacting me—hundreds of them,” he said. “Some sort of nerve gets hit. I was not taking sides on it.”Church said he was surprised that he was not contacted by people questioning the plausibility of actually cloning a Neanderthal. He compared the suggestion that someone could birth a Neanderthal using existing technology with the claim that a quarterback could throw a 200-yard pass—something that is impossible given the length of a football field.“But this, which is even more implausible, people didn’t detect,” Church said.He said that while not all news organizations made the mistake, “almost all of the headlines were wrong.” The error was not simply a mistake in the translation between English and German, he said.“I think the secondary resources feel a great deal more liberty,” Church said. “They don’t feel as constrained by the primary data. I’m not sure that’s a good thing.”—Staff writer Samuel Y. Weinstock can be reached at sweinstock@college.harvard.edu.

Most people would not spend days strategizing how to win a foosball game, but in this year’s second annual Student Computational Challenge, teams were challenged to do just that and code a program to trump opponents in a virtual tournament.James A. Damore, a second-year Ph.D. student in systems biology, and Bo Waggoner, a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science, beat seven other student teams Wednesday during the event, winning a pair of iPad Minis as reward.“In the end, our solution was simple, but we were actually pretty confident it was optimal,” Damore said.The challenge, which opened Monday morning in Maxwell Dworkin, required the teams to submit algorithms which then faced off in a round robin tournament. In the winners’ final implementation, Damore said he coded most of the algorithms while Waggoner designed methods to test and visualize their performance.Pavlos Protopapas, a researcher at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science’s Institute for Applied Computational Science, helped organize the competition as a part of ComputeFest­—a week of Wintersession activities planned by the organization.
While last year’s challenge was an optimization problem for teams to solve on their own, Protopapas decided that a sports game would provide a more interactive experience for this year’s competitors.“I wanted the challenge to be a little more dynamic, a little more fun,” Protopapas said.In the game, students submitted a starting lineup of players, distributed as they wished across the virtual field. As the ball moved across the field, a server communicated that information to the students’ programs, which they could then use to reposition the players.Damore and Waggoner’s strategy was to first simplify the problem, imagining a case where they could not reposition players. They found that the best solution was to place the most players in the midfield and then adapt that strategy to the more complicated problem.“We had to test everything against different strategies,” Damore said. “It would be very easy to be blind to certain strategies and then lose to those in the competition.”Protopapas said he designed the challenge so that it could be approached using a variety of methods. At the end of the competition, the top four teams presented and discussed their individual strategies.—Staff writer Brian C. Zhang can be reached at brianzhang@college.harvard.edu.

As the spring semester begins, so does the racing season for Erika Veidis, a sophomore on the Harvard track and field team who specializes in the 800-meter race. But for this Pfoho resident, there is another Crimson race taking place.
Not only is she dating sophomore Alexander “Zander” Bonorris on the lightweight crew team, her close friend and roommate Molly Renfer races alongside her on the track team.
In an effort to see who would win a race for Veidis’s heart, we had the trio participate in The Back Page’s “For Love or the Game” series. We asked Veidis a medley of questions and then posed those same questions to Bonorris and Renfer to see who knew her better. So who prevailed in this heat? Who sped to the finish, the rower or the racer?<a name=""jump"">Erika Veidis, sophomore on track team
Favorite athlete: Amantle Montsho, Allyson Felix, or Alysia Montano

This winter, for the first time I traveled to a country without knowing quite what to call it. Since 1989, the country has had two distinct names. According to the military government, it is Myanmar; yet to those fighting to restore democracy, it has remained Burma. Thus, in the two decades since the military junta rebranded the country as Myanmar, the national nomenclature has become polarized to represent two distinct visions for the country’s future. As a foreigner hailing from the world’s bastion of democracy, I felt compelled to adhere to our national stance on the issue and refer to the country as Burma. I found this choice to be supported by most of the people I encountered on my trip. However, after two weeks in the country, I became more aware of the degree of legitimacy that has been restored to the Myanmar government in the past few years. Although the gulf between the military and proponents of democracy has not been completely bridged, the effort the government has taken to move toward democracy should be considered as the world judges where the country, and its name, stand.Before I examine the grounds on which the government has begun to reestablish its legitimacy on an international stage, it is important to untangle the country’s complicated history, reflected in its many name changes. Before the British took power in Burma in 1824, the country was referred to as both Myanmar and Burma—the former in formal contexts and the latter more colloquially. As in many other colonial sagas, it was the British who decided to <a href=""http://www.burma-center.org/en/publications/articles/item/104-burma-or-myanmar/"">officially dub the country Burma. After the country gained independence in 1948, the name Burma lasted through a brief era of civilian democracy and on through the 1962 military coup. However, after great turmoil and the failure to hand power over to the National League for Democracy Party under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, who had rightfully won the election, the military leadership changed the name to the Union of Myanmar in 1989. They hoped that the new name, which they incorrectly claimed encompassed all of the ethnic minorities in the country, not just the majority Burmese, would once again draw the support of the people.After the military government accumulated one of the world’s worst human rights records, including the state-sponsored slaughter of protesting monks in the 2007 Saffron Revolution, countries around the world rightfully shut their doors to the ruling regime and imposed harsh economic sanctions. Yet the last three years have seen the reversal of what seemed to be the unending abuse of the Burmese people by their government. Perhaps the government felt the tides changing with the Arab Spring or could no longer foresee an economic future under stringent international sanctions. Due to these compounding circumstances, the country held a general election in 2010, and former General Thein Sein was elected as the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/04/burma-names-thein-sein-president"">first civilian president in 49 years. Since his election, President Thein Sein has been called <a href=""http://world.time.com/2013/01/10/the-regimes-inner-reformist-can-thein-sein-change-burma/"">Burma’s Gorbachev, ushering in a post-junta era of reform that has included decreasing media censorship, releasing political prisoners, and allowing Aung San Su Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, to run for Parliament in last year’s by-elections.On my visit to Burma this past December, the air of optimism that has accompanied these long sought-after changes was almost palpable. While a Burmese citizen would have likely been imprisoned two years ago for endorsing the National League for Democracy, NLD signs and offices now line roads throughout the country.  People spoke realistically about the changes, saying that the ingrained corruption in the military and the government certainly would not disappear overnight and that tensions still flare up between the ethnic minorities on the country’s borders. However, for the first time in 50 years, change was becoming a reality.This past November, democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi spoke about the 1989 name change in an <a href=""http://www.3news.co.nz/Suu-Kyi-Its-Burma-not-Myanmar/tabid/417/articleID/277768/Default.aspx"">interview: “I still object to it. So I will always refer to his country as Burma, until the Burmese people decide what they want it to be called.” Even with the recent changes, it is understandable that it is currently still impossible for the nation’s democratic leaders to accept a name that represents the abuses of a totalitarian government. Yet Suu Kyi herself has adopted a mode of compromise recently, working with former generals such as Thein Sein to pave the way toward democracy. Thus, for the time being, the country still stands somewhere in between Burma and Myanmar, but both sides are gradually collaborating to support the country’s journey to reestablish a booming economy and democracy. The fledgling post-junta government will meet its first real test in 2015 when the first truly contested national elections are scheduled. If elections are allowed to proceed smoothly and Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy are able to legitimately campaign, it may be time for the world to fully embrace a reformed and legitimate Myanmar.

Flu season comes every year, but flu fever seemingly only comes every few. This is one of those years, as the nation is once again gripped with such a feverish panic. The routine is simple. First, mayors announce a public health emergency. Then, news organizations seize onto the story, scaring viewers to gain an audience. Parents racked with worry tell us not to shake hands, touch doors, or generally venture outside our homes. Finally, confined inside, us 21st century denizens use Google to seek advice, and Google tracks our manic searches.So just how bad is this year’s influenza virus? Well <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/opinion/collins-the-flu-who-knew.html?_r=1&amp;"">according to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, who was the first to declare a public health emergency, “This is the worst flu season we’ve seen since 2009.” <a href=""http://www.google.org/flutrends/"">Google’s search algorithms concur. This is the worst flu season in four whole years!Flu season marks not only a rise in temperatures but also a drop in rational thinking. Luckily, the Centers of Disease Control has it together, rightfully saying the same thing they do every year. “The bottom line: It’s flu season,” <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/opinion/collins-the-flu-who-knew.html?_r=1&amp;"">said director Tom Frieden. While I do not mean to suggest that sickness is any laughing matter, the mania that has accompanied it this year seems silly. After all, flu season is an inevitability, and the vaccine treatment opportunity is the same year in, year out.A <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0052814"">Wake Forest study published last week on the psychology of safe behavior in epidemics shows that “people’s willingness to engage in safe behavior waxes or wanes over time…when prevalence is low, a ‘self-protection fatigue’ effect sets in whereby individuals are less willing to engage in safe behavior over time.” So with the last two winters being unseasonably warm, it seems as if we have forgotten that flu seasons can in fact be debilitating and that it is important to get the vaccine early.While many want to talk about the degree of this year’s flu outbreak and try to convince the last skeptical few that the vaccine is more likely to protect one’s health than cause autism, the flu conversation centers on all the wrong issues. We must discuss how to prevent the spread of flu next year and every year after that. If the flu is so predictable, it seems obvious that the public health community, with much of its brain trust here in Boston and at Harvard, should by now have a consistent preventative medical response.
To create a culture around yearly flu vaccinations, we should look to how social knowledge is created. Social scientists have long known the best way to achieve a shared cultural consciousness is habitualization. Consistency in Harvard University Health Services’ preventative approach to the flu in the critical August-December months should be prioritized. Several students contacted for this article expressed that the level of publicity for the flu shot this year wasn’t consistent with last year. Even if the previous year’s flu season was mild, consistent advertising is important. If our medical institutions take a break on emphasizing early prevention even for a year, the Harvard community could enter into the so-called “self-protection fatigue” and forget to get the vaccine. In that case, we all get the flu fever.Another implication of the Wake Forest study is that lowering the cost of self-protection increases its uptake. Since the vaccine is already free, the most costly part about getting it is the time spent in line and finding the HUHS clinic hours. Of the students I spoke with, those who were athletes all received the flu vaccine because it was both required and provided during their yearly physicals. To make things as simple and uniform for the rest of the Harvard community, any patient given a physical or who visits HUHS for any reason from August-December should be offered the flu vaccine. We would all rather get a shot with our visit than have to stand in another line. It’s also more preferable than standing in the massive lines in January, when supplies are running low and are not guaranteed. The administration should take this and other efforts to make the vaccination process uniform. For instance, a yearly campus-wide email to encourage vaccination early in the fall semester would be much more helpful than an after-the-fact email warning students with any flu symptoms to stay home.We have a fever on our hands this year, and if we don’t do anything about it, we’ll go through this very same dance again in a couple of years. We already know there will be a flu season next year and every year after that. We know that getting the vaccine early will help us stay protected. Hopefully, Harvard recognizes the predictability of this year’s madness and makes real institutional changes that are consistently anticipatory of flu season each year. If nothing else, let’s remember this aphorism: A flu shot a year keeps the fever away!Jason A. Gandelman ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is a neurobiology concentrator in Eliot House.

President Obama spent almost 20 minutes addressing the nation during his second inaugural address on Monday. As he delivered his remarks, it became increasingly clear that we were in for a speech different in both tone and substance than the largely post-partisan and conciliatory approach proffered four years prior. While the first-term Obama pleaded America to hopefully accept the notion that “the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html?pagewanted=all"">stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply,” the new and improved version implores an unidentified opponent to not “<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/obamas-second-inaugural-speech.html?pagewanted=all"">mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.”The shift in the nature of his speech marked a momentous occasion. Instead of blithely pretending that all Americans share the same principled beliefs, Obama argued that the fight for freedom and justice is not complete until there is necessary action on a variety of progressive fronts. The president made history by becoming the first of his office to publicly come out in favor of gay equality under the law, and he attracted almost as much post-address attention for his support of legislation addressing climate change. Some, including Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, criticized the audacity of his remarks, ominously announcing “the <a href=""http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/278583-mcconnell-obama-speech-proof-era-of-liberalism-is-back"">era of liberalism is back” in what is ultimately a mistake “directed at an America [he] still [believes] is center-right.”While Senator McConnell is not wrong about the liberal nature of President Obama’s peroration, his assertion that Obama’s progressive views conflict with those held by the majority of the country is nonsensical. This fall, Obama not only won reelection, giving him a mandate to carry out the agenda he pleases, but his Democratic Party also picked up seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.Furthermore, public opinion polling continually demonstrates nationwide support for the social agenda outlined by the president. <a href=""http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/environment_energy/energy_update"">Sixty-three percent of Americans now identify global warming as a serious problem. Support for same-sex marriage rises year after year, such that a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/12/13/wsjnbc-poll-majority-now-backs-gay-marriage/"">poll shows 51 percent of the country in favor. This measure is up from 30 percent in 2004 and 41 percent in 2009. At this rate, an overwhelming majority will likely approve of marriage equality by the next election. We strongly believe it is the duty of the nation’s leader to reflect the views of where the country is going, as opposed to those of where the country has been.The problem we have with President Obama’s address does not stem from his better-late-than-never advocacy of issues many have spent the last four years so patiently waiting for. Rather, the speech’s flaw results from the issue the president conveniently ignored: the perilous state of our nation’s finances and impending budgetary decisions. We are disappointed with the president’s wholesale commitment to entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, each of which he mentioned by name. Mention of these policies in the same breath as important constitutional rights reflects a fundamental lack of seriousness in confronting one of the most urgent battles ahead. It is no secret that the structure of American entitlement spending needs to be reformed. As such, it is disappointing to see the president return to election-style demagoguery, reminiscent of when each side spuriously accused the other of wanting to take away Medicare.
On the whole, it was refreshing to see Obama take up the issues that originally attracted so many passionate campaign supporters. We are optimistic that the president will make strides in the realm of civil rights such as those not seen in half a decade. However, we also hope that he does not lose sight of the financial uncertainty plaguing so many Americans since the days of his predecessor. There may remain a yet un-bridged divide in the nation on the topic of social issues, but the country stands united in its desideration of more jobs and a growing economy.

With senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk playing in the Senior Bowl this week and entering his name into the NFL Draft pool, The Back Page takes a look at what scouts have been saying about the Crimson’s best prospect.
CBS Sports:
Like many other drafting websites, CBS has <a href=""http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/prospectrankings/2013/FB"">forecasted Juszczyk as playing fullback in the pros. The Harvard tight end is bigger than all the other fullbacks on the rankings and is fifth overall, trailing four Division-I prospects—three of which are from Big Six conference schools. Their experts project five drafted fullbacks, with another five that could possibly go late in the seventh round.
Yahoo Sports:
Like CBS, Yahoo <a href=""http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl-draft-top-250-prospects-012007259--nfl.html"">lists the former Crimson star as a fullback and has him ranked in the same spot. Yahoo expects him to be drafted in the seventh round, which is typical for the fullback position. Also of note here: Juszczyk runs a faster 40 than the top two tight ends on the board, Stanford’s Zach Ertz and Notre Dame’s Tyler Eifert.<a name=""jump"">

Seen <a href=""http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/30302"">here, ESPN does not have much information on Juszczyk. Since neither the NFL Combine nor any ‘pro days’ for seniors have started, the lack of information is not surprising. The website’s Insider scouting profiles have him listed as the tenth-ranked fullback with a grade of 30 that is similar to the five players above him. The grade of 30 describes a ‘borderline draft prospect’ that “certainly do not have the full package in terms of NFL talent…will usually rate in the bottom third of players at his position and will be considered a later round draft choice or un-drafted free agent.”
Detroit Lions Draft:
This <a href=""http://www.detroitlionsdraft.com/2013/01/senior-bowl-notebook-north-squad-day-two/"">website, dedicated to the drafting process of the Detroit Lions, had writers on hand to attend each Senior Bowl practice and make notes on the players involved. It noted that Juszczyk “has some Vonta Leach in him” and that the “one thing that stands out with Juszczyk is his genuine love of contact and his aggressiveness.”
Others of Note:
College Sports Journal, a scouting website, <a href=""http://www.college-sports-journal.com/index.php/ncaa-division-i-sports/fcs-football/273-the-top-100-players-in-fcs"">has Juszczyk as its 100th rated pro prospect from the Football Championship Subdivision. Juszczyk is joined on the list, which was created in advance of the 2012 season, by three other Ivy League players: then-Cornell junior Jeff Mathews, then-Princeton senior Caraun Reid, and then-Cornell senior Shane Savage, who were ranked 10th, 39th, and 71th on the list, respectively.
NFL Future, a website dedicated to discussing draft prospects, <a href=""http://nflsfuture.com/2012/10/21/2013-nfl-draft-tight-end-rankings/"">has Juszczyk currently as its 14th ranked tight end, ranked immediately ahead of Nebraska senior Ben Cotton. Juszczyk is expected, according to the website, to go somewhere in the fifth or sixth round.
Optimum Scouting, another drafting <a href=""http://www.optimumscouting.com/draft/articles/2013-senior-bowl-interview-notes-from-the-top-prospects-in-mobile.html"">website, sat down with each player for interviews. The writer was surprised that Juszczyk, who predominantly played the slot receiver position, hasn’t gotten an invitation to the NFL Combine and noted that “he should end up one.” He added that he thought Juszczyk was more in the 4.5 range than the 4.73 listed on other sites when discussing his 40-yard dash times, “which would be really impressive for the H-back/slot TE prospect”
NFL Draft 101 scouted drills and <a href=""http://www.nfldraft101.com/draft/articles/894/North_Practice_Recap_-_Wednesday.jsp"">wrote this about Juszczyk: “Shown soft hands with the ability to make tough catches, a definite H-back type. Blocking is a concern and he will need to develop his techniques.”

CORRECTION: Jan. 31, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that tight end Kyle Juszczyk was the only Ivy League player to make scouting website College Sports Journal's pre-2012 season list of 100 top-rated prospects. In fact, Juszczyk was one of four Ivy League players ranked in the list.

When the Harvard men’s basketball team welcomes Dartmouth to Lavietes Pavilion Saturday for the Crimson’s Ivy League home opener, the Big Green will look to prove once again that non-conference records can be misleading.Despite having won five more games than Dartmouth before the start of Ancient Eight play, Harvard fell behind in the second half at Leede Arena two weeks ago, but clutch shooting down the stretch put the Crimson on top by 10 as freshman point guard Siyani Chambers netted a season-high 22 points.“They’re going to think they can beat us, especially playing how we played against them last time,” co-captain guard Christian Webster said.After the win against Dartmouth, Harvard closed out its non-conference schedule in Memphis last week. The Crimson mounted a second-half comeback after falling behind by 16 points at the half, but foul trouble late in the game allowed the favored Tigers to pull out a 60-50 win.Harvard struggled when Chambers—the second-half catalyst in the win over Dartmouth and the Crimson’s second leading scorer with 12.7 points per game—was pulled late in the game after committing his fourth personal foul. When in the game, Chambers had trouble holding onto the ball, committing a season-high seven turnovers and failing to make up for it with only four points.
“We need to do better with taking care of the ball, we need to do better with keeping Dartmouth off the backboard, and we need to better in our post defense,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m hopeful that we can see some improvements and some carryover from the second half of Memphis going into Dartmouth on Saturday.”After the loss of its top four scorers from last season, the young team spent the first half of its schedule in search of its identity. While consistently relying on Chambers and sophomore wing Wes Saunders—who leads the team and the Ivy League with 16.1 points per game—the Crimson has depended on contributions from a number of players throughout the season.The young squad has struggled with consistency, especially in keeping up the level of play for a full 40 minutes. In losses against Connecticut and Memphis, Harvard remained in contention well into the second half before allowing its opponents to run away and close out the game.“[Inconsistency is] a factor and a function of youth,” Amaker said. “Usually consistency and youth don’t go hand in hand, and that’s kind of where we’ve been.”On Saturday, the Crimson will have to contend with Dartmouth’s 6’9” leading scorer, Gabas Maldunas—who averages 11 points per game. In the first game against Harvard this year, the forward grabbed a team-high six rebounds and added 10 points in the paint.The Big Green had four scorers in double digits that day, with freshmen forward Connor Boehm and guard Alex Mitola leading the way with 11 points each. But Dartmouth could not contend with a hot shooting Harvard offense, which went 27 for 43 from the field, shooting over 60 percent for the second straight game.Through the first half of the season, the Big Green and the Crimson have been living out opposite stories. Harvard tops the Ivy League leaderboard in points per game and field goal percentage, while Dartmouth sits in last place in both categories.With 13 games left to play, Amaker said Harvard is looking to take it one game at a time. In the Ivy League—where the Crimson will face each other team twice—one conference win or loss can make or break a title run.“This part of the season is what really matters when it comes down to it,” Webster said. “Everybody is starting all over.”Having faced off less than two weeks ago, both teams will look to improve on their last performances and learn from the result. With one Ivy League game in the books, Harvard will look to rebound from the loss against Memphis and start a three-game home stand with a win while the Big Green will look to build on its 82-40 blowout over Colby-Sawyer last week.“Hopefully we can get off to a good start,” Amaker said. “If we can make sure we’re not picking up silly fouls especially in the early stages of the game, I would feel like we’ve done a pretty decent job to begin our conference home stand.”—Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu.

I attended the marriage of two teachers at my former school over the break. Hymns were sung, readings were taken from Bible and from poems, prayers were offered for the hope of love in our weary world. As they were two men this was a “blessing,” not a sacrament; under British law, this was a “civil partnership” and not a wedding. The Church of England, in internecine spasm over sexuality, deployed an observer to ensure the priest stayed within orthodoxy, some abject person having complained to the bishop about the use of the church building. Despite this, in every real way, two people in love were married on New Year’s Eve. Neither earth, nor rock, nor curtain split. It seemed a moment of grace so self-evident you’d dream it would melt the hardest, most hateful hearts.As this event created a new family, it trawled the collective memory of my own, resurrecting talk of a relative I had not known before. Roy was my grandfather’s uncle. Roy was young in England’s interwar years, lodged in reminiscence as sunlight-dappled, faintly melancholic idyll, full of misplaced hope and constrained grief. There are albums, apparently, of photographs—Brideshead boys in sepia. Roy was young, which was easy, and homosexual, which was not; and as he aged away from the former the harder the latter became. In darker, post-war years, with no expectation of permanence, no possibility of intimacy beneath the jackboot of criminality, Roy killed himself. Not because of what he was, but because of what a stunted society made it mean. Sixty years later, the trauma fades to an old woman’s sigh. “Poor Roy could never be himself,” my grandmother says.My teachers held their reception in the grandest room of my grand high school, panelled with the names of alumni fallen in the world wars. “They were young”, the inscriptions say. At that intersection of past and future, hope and loss, I think of Roy. He came of lesser background, but I struggle to separate my paltry notion of him from the handsome innocents, fresh from dormitory and playing field, sent to Somme and Spitfire to die. Many of them, those who wrote and poetized at least, were men like Roy: Wilfred Owen, Rupert Brooke, others on that wall no doubt, lost to time and concealment. They thought of Achilles, Nisus, and Hyacinthus; they fell for Britain and its flowered fields, for its empire they would never see and its freedoms they did not know.Surrounded by their names, I wondered what they would think of the wedding. I had cared about marriage equality and discrimination, intellectually and personally, as so many of us do, but never before with a sense of righteousness. That is a word we often surrender to our opponents, along with words like truth and zeal. Instead, we couch our struggles in fairness and equality; fine, relativistic, non-objectionable phrases. We do not talk of morality, because there is no debate in morality.  There is no room for the necessary and active process of changing minds. We respect that which should not be respected. Though they call us wicked, we do not call them the same, even when they sermonize their children to suicide or sponsor executions in Africa. We respond, when they claim the marginalization of their opinions and loss of their societal monopoly is “intolerance,” as if they had knowledge of the word. We go on, though we are tired. We speak, though they will not listen.With Roy though, I find the limit of tolerance. At a point, we must stand up for those who kneeled. All minorities carry with them the burdens of their past: scars of survival, guilt of possibility, difficulty in integrating their todays, tomorrows, and yesterdays. The Germans, in their compound way, call it “vergangenheitsbewältigung”—the struggle to come to terms with the past. Just as time is illusory, so the past is always with us, even if it cannot speak. In liminal moments, it is one with the present. Like my grandfather’s uncle, it finds us out, whether we seek it or not.
As we enter this new year full of potential advances, those of us who care about justice and equality should recommit ourselves to the cause with the knowledge that Dr. Martin Luther King’s universal arc is with us, that the past will be healed and the future made brighter. When you encounter genuine ignorance, misapprehension, and misconception, work to correct it, not because you should have to but because you can. When you encounter hatefulness, wrapped in pseudo-religion or pseudo-intellectualism, with “purity” on its lips and barbed wire in its eyes, expose it for what it is. This is our moral necessity. Under the light of history’s truth, it will fade away. It deserves to die, as much as Roy did not.Felix L. J. Cook ’13 is a joint government and literature concentrator in Quincy House.

After two weeks free of intercollegiate obligations, the Harvard women’s basketball team looks to pick up right where it left off.On Jan. 12, the Crimson opened up Ivy League play with a comprehensive win over Dartmouth, 88-66, at Lavietes Pavilion. This Saturday, Harvard hopes for a similar result in Hanover.“We’re dying to play,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I would guess the same with Dartmouth. The two week break isn’t ideal, so we’re pretty excited to be playing.”Harvard will be seeking its seventh straight win over the Big Green. The Crimson (10-5, 1-0 Ivy) heads into Saturday’s matchup tied with Princeton for the Ivy League’s best overall record. Dartmouth (2-13, 0-1 Ivy) is tied with Columbia for the conference’s worst.“Their program is kind of in the rebuilding stages, but the Harvard-Dartmouth rivalry goes back so many years,” junior guard Christine Clark said. “It’s always a competitive game, and we always have to be on our best game to beat them.”
In Harvard’s last outing against Dartmouth, the Crimson jumped out to a 16-point advantage in the first half and extended the lead in the second. Clark and senior forward Victoria Lippert led all scorers with 22 and 19 points, respectively.“Both [Lippert] and I really took what the defense gave us,” Clark said. “And we just had great team offense, working the ball around, which opened [Lippert and me] up for drives and pull-ups.”For the third time this season, Clark earned Ivy League Player of the Week honors. She currently leads all Ivy scorers with 16.9 points per game.The Crimson’s reserves also put up big numbers against the Big Green as Harvard’s bench combined for 37 points. In just eight minutes on the floor, freshman guard Shilpa Tummala contributed a career-high 10 points as she shot 4-for-4 from the field.“It doesn’t surprise me when [Tummala] comes in and shoots 4-for-4,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s capable of that.”The freshman has begun to show improvements on the court as she continues to rehab a shoulder injury that she sustained in high school.On Saturday, the Crimson will try to contain sharp-shooting senior guard Faziah Steen, who led all Dartmouth scorers with 18 points and recorded a game-high five steals two weeks ago at Lavietes. Steen is the sole senior on a young Big Green squad.“She’s one of the better players in the league,” Delaney-Smith said of Steen. “We could have done a better job on her. She’s fast, she’s grown, and she’s always been a tremendous shooter, and now she’s taking it to the hole pretty well, so we’ve got to adjust.”Steen will share the backcourt duties with junior point guard Nicola Zimmer, who was out with a knee injury two weeks ago. Steen, Zimmer, and junior Eve Zelinger are Dartmouth’s only upperclassmen.Freshman forward Lakin Roland led Dartmouth’s underclassmen corps two weeks ago, coming off the bench to score 13 points. Sophomores Tia Dawson and Abbey Schmitt may also challenge Harvard’s backcourt tomorrow.

Huntington D. Lambert, the head of continuing education at Colorado State University and one of the leading voices in online education, will become the next dean of Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced in an email to faculty members Thursday.Lambert will replace outgoing dean Michael Shinagel, who <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/21/dean-shinagel-leaves/"">announced last September that he would be stepping down after almost four decades of leadership.In his email Smith praised Lambert as a “bold innovator who possesses the rare combination of a strategic business sensibility and a true commitment to our academic mission.”Lambert is the founder of CSU’s Global Campus, the first entirely online public university, and has had a long career in technology management. His appointment as dean of DCE comes less than a year after Harvard and MIT <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/2/mit-edx-virtual-online/"">announced that they were joining forces to found a new online education platform called edX. Since last May, two dozen courses have been or are currently being offered by the platform, and six other institutions of higher education—including Georgetown and the University of Texas—have joined the venture.When Lambert’s appointment officially begins at the end of April, he will oversee the Extension and Summer schools as well as a number of other DCE programs, with a focus on expanding DCE’s presence on the edX platform, according to Smith.
“At this exciting moment, when technology and education are combining in new and important ways here at Harvard, Lambert’s experience and track record of success are particularly welcome,” Smith wrote.When outgoing dean Shinagel announced his departure last fall, he indicated that his decision to step aside came as the University wished to place greater emphasis on online coursework and find a new figure to lead the school for the next two decades. The search to replace Shinagel has been ongoing for more than two years, Smith wrote.Neither Lambert nor Shinagel could be reached for comment Thursday.Lambert, who served in a number of different capacities during his time at CSU, most recently oversaw 10,000 students in his role as Vice Provost of the Division of Continuing Education at the school. Prior to being named to that position, he helped to found the university’s Entrepreneurship Center and Office of Economic Development, among more than a dozen other initiatives.Global Campus, the most successful venture from his tenure at CSU, boasts more than 7,000 enrolled students for the Spring 2013 semester. Since its founding in 2007, the online school has developed both undergraduate and graduate degree programs as a stand-alone state university.—Staff writer Nicholas P.

Thomas G. Stemberg ’71, founder of the retail chain Staples and a prominent supporter of the Harvard mens’ basketball program, characterized the College’s handling of the Government 1310 cheating scandal as “Orwellian” in a personal letter addressed to University President Drew G. Faust.In the letter, whose greeting read, “Dear Drew,” Stemberg leveled a harsh rebuke at the academic dishonesty investigation that brought down the two co-captains of a Harvard team with NCAA tournament prospects.“Over 40 years as a student, an alumnus, and Harvard parent, I have never seen the need to write a letter of complaint,” Stemberg wrote in the opening line of his letter. “However, the University’s approach to and handling of the so-called ‘Congress’ cheating scandal compels me to write one.”Stemberg declined to comment on the letter, which was dated Jan. 6 and obtained by The Crimson earlier this week. Stemberg’s criticism emerges near the close of an investigation that has ensnared about 125 students accused of inappropriately collaborating on a take-home final exam in the spring course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”Harvard <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/"">announced the massive cheating case at the end of August, and last week a Harvard spokesperson said that the College would <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/22/government-ad-board-announcement/"">make an announcement about the results of the case near the start of the spring semester.
In addition to sending his letter to Faust, Stemberg sent copies to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, Executive Director of the Harvard Alumni Association John P. Reardon, Jr. ’60, and members of the Harvard Corporation. All declined to comment on this article.Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin declined to comment on the correspondence on behalf of Faust.Stemberg is <a href=""http://www.gocrimson.com/information/support/friends"">listed on gocrimson.com as a co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Basketball, an organization of alumni that fundraises for the team.He played a major role in <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/7/the-rise-harvard-basketball/"">revamping Harvard’s basketball program after former head coach Frank Sullivan was <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/3/6/mens-basketball-coach-fired-frank-sullivan/"">let go in 2007. With other alumni donors, he helped finance a salary increase to recruit current head basketball coach Tommy Amaker, who led the Crimson to its first <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/7/mbk-tournament-030612/"">March Madness appearance in 66 years last season. Star players Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13, who were instrumental in the team’s success last year, were named co-captains of the squad and expected by some to lead the Crimson to a third straight Ivy title this season.But their prospects were derailed by Harvard’s Government 1310 investigation. Media outlets reported in September that both <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/11/harvard-mens-basketball-kyle-casey-to-withdraw-reports/"">chose to withdraw from the College to minimize NCAA eligibility penalties as they awaited possible disciplinary consequences resulting from the scandal.Stemberg wrote that he personally knows some of the approximately 125 accused students. In his letter, Stemberg classified the students embroiled in the scandal into two different categories: those who “clearly went too far, literally cutting and pasting their answers,” and those who “did no more than write answers from notes that were derived in the collaborative atmosphere the class encouraged.”Stemberg slammed the University for dolling out the same punishment to both groups, dragging students “through a seemingly endless judicial process.” That process, Stemberg wrote, “damag[ed] the educational experience and the reputation of scores of innocent students.”Stemberg also excoriated the way that assistant government professor Matthew B. Platt organized Government 1310, writing that the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/4/government-exam-harder-questions/"">structure of the class confused students and contributed to the scope of the scandal.“We had a professor who, like many the Faculty of Arts and Sciences assigns to teach undergraduates, was clearly not qualified to do so,” he wrote. At press time, Platt could not be reached for comment.According to Stemberg, Platt’s inconsistent instructions left many confused about the course’ s collaboration policy.

Renowned MIT physics professor and virtual education veteran Walter Lewin has added his popular course on electricity and magnetism to this spring’s edX class offerings, announced the online educational platform on Tuesday.<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/4/edx-scrutiny-online-learning/"">EdX, a not-for-profit venture launched jointly by Harvard and MIT in spring of 2012, aims to expand access to educational courses and revolutionize online and on-campus learning. Lewin’s course is the latest addition to edX’s spring selection, which includes new 2013 offerings such as “Justice” from Michael J. Sandel and “The Ancient Greek Hero” from Gregory Nagy.Lewin’s course, MITx 8.02 Electricity and Magnetism, is a second semester introductory physics class that covers electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetism, and the nature of light as well as other topics like big-bang cosmology, superconductivity, and color perception. The course is based on the on-campus class that he taught at MIT in the spring of 2002 and will be accompanied by problem-solving sessions and interactive simulations on course material.“My lectures in MIT have always been very unusual, very special,” said Lewin, who returned from retirement to work full-time on his edX courses. “Physics is my life, and teaching is in my blood.”Known for his lively demonstrations and animated delivery, Lewin has been making his lectures available to students around the world for over two decades. In 1983, Lewin began offering instruction through MIT Cable TV, and twelve years later, the University of Washington TV station began screening his lectures to a broad audience of various ages.
More recently, Lewin has posted his lectures on MIT’s OpenCourseWare, iTunes, and YouTube. His courses on Newtonian mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and vibrations and waves have attracted international fame and front page acclaim from The New York Times, which coined the professor a “web star” in 2007. According to his profile on MIT’s website, his lectures reach almost two million people everyday.Describing edX as an “unprecedented breakthrough” comparable to the invention of the printing press, he said that he predicts two, longer-term effects of virtual education through edX: first, that students enrolled at universities like Harvard and MIT may begin taking virtual versions of certain courses in place of traditional, in-person courses, and second, that students may bypass lower-quality colleges and universities and opt for virtual education instead.“These certificates may have enormous impact on their lives,” said Lewin of students who successfully complete courses from edX, particularly those with limited access to higher education in their home countries.Lewin’s physics research and dynamic style of teaching has attracted many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1984 and MIT’s Everett Moore Baker Teaching Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2003. His course is currently open for enrollment and will begin on Feb. 18. He said that he is currently preparing a virtual course on mechanics for this fall and plans to offer a third course in the future.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.

Speaking at the second annual National Collegiate Research Conference, MIT physics professor Walter H. G. Lewin kicked off the three-day symposium with a bang—the big bang. Lewin delivered the keynote speech on astrophysics before a group of science, humanities, and social science researchers during the event, which focused on the theme of collaboration in research.The conference brought more than 200 students from dozens of schools to Harvard to present their research, participate in workshops, and learn from peers and professionals.The Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association, the student group that organized the event, planned the conference in an effort to bring together a variety of student researchers and encourage diversity in research subjects.To this end, the HCURA board worked closely with the Office for Undergraduate Research, which has historically represented scientific research on campus.“We definitely see a preponderance of science proposals, but our office’s effort is to look at research across disciplines,” said Gregory A. Llacer, director of the undergraduate research office.
This year in particular, the conference encompassed research in the humanities and social sciences in addition to work in the hard sciences and quantitative studies.Even in the course of his discourse on astrophysics, Lewin alluded to history of science, environmental policy, and gender disparities in science.Chris E. Hernandez ’13 also embraced this focus on curricular diversity, presenting research on the impact of incriminating evidence on the memories of witnesses.The variety of disciplines present at the conference was evident in its speaker lineup as well. While Lewin, a physics professor, delivered the keynote address, the roster of speakers scheduled to give talks at the conference includes scholars drawn from psychology, economics, and biomedicine.When selecting participants for the conference, the admissions committee strove to represent schools beyond just Harvard.Ultimately Harvard undergraduates made up one third of the event’s attendees.“We really wanted this to be a conference by students for students,” said Leandra A. Barnes ’13, co-president of HCURA.—Staff writer Jessica A. Barzilay can be reached at jessicabarzilay@college.harvard.edu.

After major changes in the Buffalo Bills organization, the future of Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05 with the franchise remains muddled. The Bills, if looking to go in a different direction behind center, would save half a million dollars by cutting him. The team has a new coaching staff, headlined by former Syracuse head coach Doug Marrone, and a new president of football operations (Russ Brandon) with a possible replacement for current general manager Buddy Nix coming. Coming up on the four-year anniversary of his signing with the Bills, Fitzpatrick’s future is uncertain but his impact on the team over the past four years is clear.<a name=""jump"">Before signing with the Bills in February 2009, Fitzpatrick was an NFL journeyman. Brief stints with the St. Louis Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals showed flashes of good play—Fitzpatrick is one of seven quarterbacks to throw for 300 yards in his first game—but he was let go by the Bengals to make way for the return of a previously-injured Carson Palmer. The Amish Rifle signed with the Bills as a backup, sitting the first six games of the season until starter Trent Edwards went down with an injury in an October game against the New York Jets. Fitzpatrick finished that game, a 16-13 Bills win, and was named the starter exactly one month later. The next season, after being forced to sit behind Edwards the first two games, Fitzpatrick was named the starter again and has started 39 of the 40 games since (one missed due to injury).
Fitzpatrick signed a massive, six-year, $59 million extension in October 2011 but has not been able to provide the Bills with wins to back up his contract. Fitzpatrick is 12-20 over his past two years with the team, throwing for 7,232 yards and 48 touchdowns during that span but also turning the ball over 49 times. Although surrounded by elite running back talent in C.J. Spiller and Fred Jackson, Fitzpatrick has struggled with throws down the field and the lack of a second wide receiving option after Stevie Johnson. However, he provided a ray of light for a franchise that had dealt with the subpar quarterback play of J.P. Losman and Trent Edwards (a combined 71 turnovers against only 49 scores in the six years prior to Fitzpatrick) but the team’s commitment to him had adverse effects.
By committing to Fitzpatrick—a 28-year old quarterback entering his prime at the time of signing—the Bills decided to not pursue an alternative through the draft or in free agency. The team has historically struggled to lure free agents to Buffalo (the Mario Williams pickup notwithstanding), meaning that the team’s decision to go with Fitzmagic was essentially a choice between him and the riskiness of the draft. In the two years since the Bills made Fitzpatrick their starter, they have held top-10 picks in the NFL draft (not including the year he started 10 games—where drafting Spiller in the first round has proven to be a solid selection). With the third pick in the 2011 draft, the Bills drafted Alabama defensive end Marcell Dareus—the only non-Pro Bowler among the seven top picks. In doing so, they passed up on first-round quarterbacks Jake Locker, Blaine Gabbert, and Christian Ponder as well as second-round selections Andy Dalton and Colin Kaepernick. In 2012, the Bills selected South Carolina cornerback Stephon Gilmore but their pick preceded only three quarterback selections in the next three rounds—Cleveland’s Brandon Weeden, Denver’s Brock Osweiler, and Seattle’s Russell Wilson.
Pursuing Fitzpatrick meant eschewing these other possible selections. Although only in their first or second years in the league, an in-prime Fitzpatrick has proved better than several of those selections. Ponder, Gabbert, Weeden and Locker have alternated flashes of greatness with predominant mediocrity and Osweiler has not left the bench behind Peyton Manning. It is easy to second guess the Bills for not drafting a backup quarterback since their current backups, Tyler Thigpen and Tavaris Jackson, are aging veterans with little upside, but Dalton, Kaepernick, or Wilson—the most successful quarterbacks the Bills could have drafted—would have been reaches in the top 10.
In summary, although Fitzpatrick has not taken the leap that the Bills expected when given the extension, he has provided a serviceable replacement for a team that has struggled elsewhere. Free agent signings Mario and Kyle Williams have similarly failed to live up to their contracts and injuries have made the rotating Spiller-Jackson backfield unreliable on a week-to-week basis. Entering a weak quarterback draft, Fitzpatrick will likely be given one more season as the starter before a stronger draft class, headlined by the possibility of Heisman winner Johnny Manziel, comes in 2013. Committing to the Harvard alum delayed the Bills from entering a long rebuilding process, but in view of the franchise’s previous quarterback play, provided a dramatic improvement under center.

Below is the text of a personal letter obtained by The Crimson this week that was sent by prominent alumnus Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 to University President Drew G. Faust. Stemberg's mailing address, which was printed in the header of the letter, has been omitted.January 6, 2013Drew G. FaustPresidentHarvard University
University HallCambridge, MA 02138Dear Drew:Over 40 years as a student, an alumnus, and Harvard parent, I have never seen the need to write a letter of complaint. However, the University’s approach to and handling of the so-called “Congress” cheating scandal compels me to write one.I know a number of the affected undergraduates, and my son knows many others. Yet I write this only after discussing the matter with two former Deans of Harvard College, who not only confirmed my dissatisfaction, but amplified it.We had a professor who, like many the Faculty of Arts and Sciences assigns to teach undergraduates, was clearly not qualified to do so. After several exams for which open collaboration was encouraged, he changed the rules. One was told that on this particular take home exam, one could not collaborate with professors, teaching fellows “and others.” One would suppose this meant students.If the message was so clearly expressed, why did some of the teaching fellows go over the exam in open session, a per se violation of the professor’s seeming intent? If they did not get the message, could one expect the students to understand it?While some students clearly went too far, literally cutting and pasting their answers, others did no more than write answers from notes that were derived in the collaborative atmosphere the class encouraged. Itwas surely appropriate to punish the former group.To then go through a seemingly endless judicial process that found virtually all of the latter group to be guilty, damaging the educational experience and the reputation of scores of innocent students was Orwellian. And then to let off only those students who lied and said others had copied from them insults the word VERITAS.As an alumnus, how can one come to any conclusion other than the University has a bloated bureaucracy so intent on being politically correct, that its students and its mission are forgotten?

While J-Term is a time to get off campus for many Harvard students, winter athletes stay on campus to train and compete. This year, the wrestling team decided to devote some of its free time to community service.Twice a week this January, the wrestling team volunteered for two charity programs—tutoring students at Mission Hill School in Boston and packing and sorting items for Cradles to Crayons.“Our program is built on two pillars—integrity and discipline. And one of the things that go along with integrity is giving back to the community,” said Brennan M. Smith ’16.The wrestling team’s commitment to community service is not new. Along with social and academic committees, the team has maintained a community outreach committee, currently headed by Shay I. Warren ’13.“It’s a way of giving back after all that we’ve been given,” said Warren.
The wrestlers worked after school at the Mission Hill School with two groups of students helping with homework. While Harvard students often volunteer at the school through Phillips Brooks House Association programs, the number of available mentors falls during the holiday break. The wrestlers stepped in to fill that void.“We give them something to look forward to at the end of their day,” said Smith.While some of the wrestlers found the work challenging, they said they learned from the experience.“A lot of times you forget what it’s like to be a kid,” said Warren. “It can be frustrating, but it’s a good chance to learn about people and how to motivate people to do something that’s good, but that they don’t want to do.”Members of the team also volunteered for Cradles to Crayons, a program that provides underprivileged children up to age 12 with items that are difficult to come by like clothes, books, and toys.Founded in Boston in 2002, Cradles to Crayons expanded to Philadelphia in 2006. As part of their service, wrestlers went to the factory to pack and sort items for distribution.Members of the team said that the trips served a dual purpose—they not only helped the community, but also brought the team closer together.“I think that a big part of it is us trying to focus on something bigger than ourselves,” said Warren. “The fact that we are all working hard for that greater good helps us all.—Staff writer Jacob W.

After two free throws from Dartmouth’s Malik Gill boosted his team’s lead to 13 with 3:49 to play in Saturday’s contest, the heavily-favored Harvard men’s basketball team appeared to be headed for its first loss to the Big Green since 2009.And when the Crimson found itself still trailing by double digits with fewer than two minutes to go, a bleak outcome seemed all but certain.But co-captain Christian Webster had other plans.The senior's nine points on three-of-three shooting from deep in the final few minutes of the game helped the Crimson (10-6, 2-0 Ivy) come back to force overtime and eventually claim a dramatic victory over Dartmouth (4-12, 0-2), 82-77, at Lavietes Pavilion.“You need to be lucky in those situations, and luck was on our side,” Webster said. “We just made plays that they didn’t make. But all the credit to them. They should have won the game.”
With 1:33 to play, Webster got the ball at the top of the key and released his first of three long-range attempts in the final stretch. The shot found the bottom of the net, pulling the Crimson to within seven.After the Big Green's Gabas Maldunas botched the front end of a one-and-one, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard attempted a three and was fouled at the other end. His two points at the stripe pushed the score to 57-52 with 1:11 left to play.“A lot of things can happen in a minute and a half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “You’re just trying to see. You’re playing it out. That’s what we do.”Thanks to two more treys from Webster in the final minute of the game, four points from freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, and four missed Dartmouth free throws down the stretch, Harvard knotted the game at 62 on a Chambers layup with 18 seconds remaining in the contest. The Big Green had a chance to win on its final possession, but Gill missed a long three to send the contest into overtime.In the extra period, Harvard came out strong, and a Rivard long ball gave the Crimson its first advantage since it led, 2-0, in the opening minutes of the game. Though Dartmouth began to find its shooting stride at the end of the extra period, it was too little too late for the Big Green. Dartmouth got within four on a three by John Golden at the 1:05 mark, but the Crimson was able to close out the contest from the line, knocking down 12 of 13 free throws in the final two minutes of play.“Our kids believed in it,” Amaker said. “It was an incredible shot in the arm for our team to be in that position [in overtime]. I thought we had the confidence as the game went down the stretch to pull through.”The Big Green came out strong on Saturday, knocking down six of its  first eight shots to claim a 12-4 advantage with 15:33 to play in the  half. And though Harvard pulled within five as late as 2:28, Dartmouth  was able to stretch the advantage back to nine and went into the break up, 29-20, after a half in which the Crimson committed 12 turnovers.Early in the second half, Harvard cut the Big Green’s lead to five with 17:14 to play on an and-one by sophomore wing Wesley Saunders. But Dartmouth pushed its advantage back up to 10 less than two minutes later.“It’s tough being in a position like Dartmouth is right now,” Amaker said. “They played their hearts out and deserved to win.”With the exception of sophomore forward Jonah Travis, who had 10 points in the first half on 4-of-5 shooting, Harvard struggled from the field in the opening frame, making just seven of its 21 shots on the half. The Crimson’s top three scorers—Saunders, Chambers, and Rivard—combined for just six points in the period.But by the game's end, Chambers led the Crimson with 21 points while Saunders chipped in with 20 and Travis added 16.John Golden and Gill led the Big Green with 15 points, while Connor Boehm scored 14.“In a lot of ways, we didn’t deserve to win it,” Amaker said. “But we had an opportunity to see if we could steal it, and I thought it was obvious that we did some incredible things down the stretch.”—Staff writer Catherine E.

While the women’s hockey team was skating to a comeback victory in overtime against St. Lawrence, its male counterpart failed to follow suit.With the score knotted at three apiece, the horn sounded to indicate the end of regulation. But unlike its last overtime game, where Harvard eked out a 6-5 victory over BU, the Crimson (5-13-1, 3-11 ECAC) was unable to find the back of the net first in the extra period, falling to the Saints (11-10-3, 4-5-3), 4-3, Saturday night at Bright Hockey Center.The loss marks the Crimson’s sixth consecutive loss and fourth straight defeat at home, where Harvard has not won since Nov. 10, 2012.“It’s definitely frustrating,” freshman forward Jimmy Vesey said. “It seems like all of these losses are blending together, and it’s not really all that fun to lose, but I think that today was a step in the right direction. We played really hard, and St. Lawrence is a good team, and we were right there.”Nearly four minutes into overtime, St. Lawrence forward Patrick Doherty slid the puck around the net, sending it to the edge of the left faceoff circle. Defender George Hughes collected the puck before sending it past junior goaltender Raphael Girard to lift the Saints to victory.
Harvard had the best opportunity to break the tie with less than three minutes left in regulation when forward Chris Martin and defender Patrick Raley entered the penalty box, giving the Crimson a two-man advantage on the ice for a full two minutes.But despite the advantage, Harvard couldn’t convert, and Saints defenders deflected shot after shot, sending the game into an extra period.“We had some looks, had some shots, but ultimately we have to find a way to get a goal there,” Crimson coach Ted Donato said. “We needed someone to step up and make a play. We had plenty of opportunities, we had possession of the puck—I think the whole time, maybe the puck came out of the zone once. I think our guys were battling, but I think there’s no question that our execution could be better.”While Harvard struggled to get its offense going, recording only one shot in the first thirteen minutes, St. Lawrence lit up the scoreboard twice in the span of two minutes.Eight minutes into the game, defender Pat Raley collected the puck outside the right faceoff circle and shot it towards the net. The puck bounced off Girard’s pads, but as the goaltender moved up to corral it, forward Pat Doherty pushed it into the net to notch the first goal of the contest.The Saints extended its lead to two when, with their goaltender pulled to put an extra man on the ice, forward Kyle Flanagan received a pass from forward Greg Carey and crossed a shot past Girard.But the Crimson retaliated a few minutes later during a power play as freshman forward Brian Hart passed to Vesey, who was waiting on the right edge of the crease. Vesey tapped the puck behind goaltender Matt Weninger to give Harvard its first point of the night.Vesey struck again 11 seconds into the second period to tie the game, 2-2. Sophomore forward Colin Blackwell and Hart worked the puck across the ice before sliding it to Vesey, who was skating towards the left post. The freshman shot it into the back right of the net to tally his second goal of the game, a feat he had not accomplished since Harvard’s home opener against Bentley.St. Lawrence briefly regained the lead 12 minutes later when Girard, anticipating a shot from Flanagan, drifted to the right post. Flanagan instead crossed the puck to the left, where forward Jeremy Wick collected it and shot it into the empty left side of the net.Senior forward Alex Fallstrom brought the score to 3-3 off of a rebound from his own missed shot attempt. The Crimson looked like it would finally gain its first lead of the game when junior defender Dan Ford drove the puck up the ice early in the third and slapped it into the crease. The puck zinged off of the right post and slid across the crease before hitting the left post. Upon review, the referees decided that the puck did not completely cross the goal line, and the score remained tied.“I give St. Lawrence credit, they kept coming and they came in having won three in a row,” Donato said. “We knew after having beaten Dartmouth last night, that they were going to throw a lot of pucks at the net. We thought really after the first 10, 12 minutes, we really settled down and played a lot better.”—Staff writer David A. Mazza can be reached at damazza@college.harvard.edu.

The No. 2 Harvard women’s ice hockey team followed up the Crimson men’s basketball team’s remarkable comeback with a come-from-behind, overtime win of their own Saturday, defeating St. Lawrence, 3-2, in Canton, N.Y.A day after Clarkson snapped Harvard’s 11-game unbeaten streak, the Crimson (17-2-1, 14-1-0 ECAC) did not own a lead at any point in the game until junior forward Kalley Armstrong powered the puck past Saints’ goaltender Carmen MacDonald with less than three minutes remaining in the extra frame.“This was a tough win for us,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It was good for us to get back on track.”The Crimson trailed by no more than one goal the entire game but never led in regulation. Things did not look promising for Harvard as St. Lawrence’s Kayla Raniwsky deflected a slap shot from teammate Dayle Wilkinson to put the Saints up, 2-1, with 11 minutes remaining in regulation.But in the final minutes, the Crimson appeared determined not to leave its weekend in New York with two losses.
“We certainly did not come all the way out there to get swept,” Fry said. “I think we really just picked it up and started dominating the game.”Following St. Lawrence’s second goal, Harvard controlled the possession, as Fry and co-captain Jillian Dempsey peppered MacDonald with shots. Dempsey and Fry led all skaters with ten and nine shots, respectively.“I saw us stand up to the play, holding the blue line defensively and trying to be more aggressive,” Stone said.Dempsey finally broke through with 6:18 left on the clock. Harvard’s leading scorer squeezed a shot from the top of the crease past MacDonald’s pads off of a centering feed from sophomore defender Michelle Picard.“[Dempsey’s] goal was her just going hard to the net,” Fry said. “That was just what we needed.”In overtime, St. Lawrence (13-9-2, 8-3-1 ECAC) called timeout with three minutes left to play. Off the ensuing faceoff in the Saints’ zone, sophomore defender Sarah Edney rang a shot off the post. In the scramble in front of the net to recover the puck, Fry found an open Armstrong in the slot for the game-winner.“The thing I love about that [goal] is that our kids, they were in the right spots, dying to score,” Stone said. “They were hungry; they were all over the net, which we weren’t on Friday night.”In the second period, overlapping hooking minors from Hillary Crowe and Kaitlin Spurling required the Crimson to kill off 1:46 of a 5-on-3 Saints power play. The two teams remained scoreless through 35 minutes.“We were trying to be too cute, honestly,” Stone said of her team’s play early in the game. “We were trying to make perfect plays and then get the puck to the net. We over-passed and didn’t get the puck on net like we typically do.”Abbey McRae of St. Lawrence opened the scoring with less than five minutes remaining in the second period. But Harvard forward Mary Parker responded less than two minutes later, converting a turnover behind the Saints’ net into a wrap-around goal.

During my first semester of college I constantly talked about New York. I told everyone who would listen about my favorite Indian restaurant, about the Astroturf field behind my high school where we ate lunch (even on 20-degree days), about the East Village community garden where I wiled away hot summer afternoons.That first semester, I sometimes walked around the neighborhood where I went to high school using Google Street View, zooming in as close as I could on the storefront of Heaven’s Hot Bagel, hoping to see blurry pixelated me sitting by the window. I never found myself, but I found two of my friends walking down East Houston. J. in her army surplus jacket and bright orange heels, R. in all black, hair still long like high school was still in session. I remembered that day. It was maybe the last week before finals. Walking to her house that afternoon, R. and I saw the Google van driving up her block. Two wiry-bodied soccer boys we knew were chasing the van, making faces and waving their arms. R. and I laughed and laughed. Later, sitting on my twin extra long bed in Greenough, I understood the urge to be frozen onto the streets of the city in digital film and wished I’d chased the van, too.Before long, I was in New York again. Winter break, summer break. The city kept me busy. I would rush between internships and appointments. By the time I was settled into my routine, I was off again, back to Cambridge.This December, I came home for a few weeks with nothing to do and all of the city to see. My second day back, I found myself caught in a dense crowd on Fifth Avenue, a block from Rockefeller Center. The throngs of holiday shoppers pushed me to the edge of the curb with the force of a great wave. New York didn’t feel like mine to command anymore. And it seemed a crueler city than I remembered. Mothers snapped at their wailing children. Subway doors snapped shut on the arms of desperate passengers, late for work. Men with sunken eyes lay sleeping in the tunnels under Penn Station on Christmas Day.My last week in the city, I ventured to Queens to visit MoMA PS1 with a friend. When we left at closing time, 6 p.m., the sky was dark and rain was falling. What next? Arepas in Astoria. Should we take the train? No, we could walk the 27 minutes (according to Google Maps). We passed under elevated subway tracks at Queens Plaza, where steam rose from gratings and cars blocked crosswalks like malevolent, growling beasts. Around the corner, an orchid warehouse. The doors of a fish market were painted with underwater seascapes, full of bright pink starfish and neon green anemones. My friend swore he saw a DeLorean parked on the side of the road. This was uncharted territory, and it was anything but scary. As we took our seats, dripping wet, we couldn’t stop smiling.

They say all good things must come to an end, and that proved to be the case Friday night for the No. 2 Harvard women’s hockey team, which dropped a 3-1 decision to No. 7 Clarkson to snap its 13-game ECAC winning streak to start the year.Carly Mercer did all the damage for the Golden Knights (20-6-0, 12-2-0 ECAC), registering her first career hat trick in the victory. Junior forward Kalley Armstrong had the lone goal for the Crimson (17-2-1, 13-1-0), which remains atop the ECAC despite the loss.“It certainly didn’t look like Harvard hockey,” junior forward Lindsey Fry said. “We were struggling a little bit. A big reason for that is that we haven’t really played a team that strong in a while... They threw everything they had at us and I think it caught us off guard.”Mercer scored twice in the third period against Crimson freshman goaltender Emerence Maschmeyer, who earned her first loss against a Clarkson squad that outshot Harvard 25-19.At the other end of the ice, Golden Knights netminder Erica Howe benefitted from her defense’s strong penalty kill, which denied Harvard on six of its seven power play opportunities. Seven Harvard penalties, meanwhile, gave Clarkson the opportunity to score two goals on five-on-four play.
“Our execution on the penalty kill was not what we wanted it to be and not where it’s been all year,” Crimson coach Katie Stone said.Facing the team’s first ranked opponent since Northeastern on Nov. 27, Stone gave the rookie Maschmeyer the road start over co-captain Laura Bellamy, despite the latter leading the nation in goals against average and save percentage.Though Maschmeyer has been dominant all season long as well, on Friday she could not stop Mercer, who scored the go-ahead goal 2:35 into the final period.After the freshman made a sprawling save with her left leg, the rest of the net was left exposed. Mercer found herself wide-open on the rebound and lifted the puck over Maschmeyer’s stick and inside the left post to put Clarkson ahead, 2-1.“They play a system and they play it very well, where they just sit people on the back door,” Fry said. “[Mercer] just happened to be at the right place at the right time, and she just whacked away at at the net. We didn’t do a good job covering her in front.”Nine minutes later, Mercer was back at it again, putting home a rebound off of an Erin Ambrose shot for a power-play score that gave the Golden Knights some much-needed breathing room.“We gave them more [chances] than they should have had,” Stone said. “Ultimately a goalie shouldn’t have to make three, four saves before a puck gets cleared.”Harvard could not generate anything the rest of the night against Howe, who registered her 50th career victory to break the Clarkson all-time record.Sophomore defenseman Michelle Picard led the Crimson with three shots, while co-captain Jillian Dempsey, who entered the contest fourth in the country in goals, was limited to just two attempts.“That game was certainly very humbling for us and it taught us a lot,” Fry said. “I think that it’s really going to help us going forward here to learn about who we are and who we want to be for the rest of the season.”

The Harvard fencing team opened its 2013 slate at the St. John’s Invitational in Queens, N.Y., going 0-5 on the women’s side (5-6) and 4-1 on the men’s team (5-5) against top-10 opponents on Saturday.Junior co-captain Alexandra Kiefer posted the strongest record of the team through the tournament. Kiefer, who specializes in foil, notched a 13-2 record.“She’s a rock,” freshman teammate Nina van Loon said. ”She’s insanely consistent and totally confident in basically everything. If I could fence like her, my life would be complete.”The No. 8 women’s team began the day with a slim loss to No. 3 Columbia, 14-13. While the women successfully took the sabre bouts, 6-3, and edged the Lions in epee, 5-4, they fell to their opponents in the foil, 7-2.While the next contest would see No. 4 Ohio State best the Crimson, 17-10, Harvard responded with two close bouts against No. 5 Penn State and No. 2 Notre Dame, both 14-13 losses.
Again, the Crimson was able to take the epee event against the Nittany Lions and the Irish, both by scores of 5-4. Harvard similarly won the sabre against Penn State, 6-3, but dropped the same event against Notre Dame, 6-3. Foil again proved to be a losing effort for the team, as the women lost 6-3 and 5-4, respectively.“I feel like the women’s team as a whole performed really well, especially given the fact that we were down one of our foilists on the squad, and our foil squad is already down a foilist,” van Loon said.Loon noted that despite the loss, the teamwork displayed by all involved is a good sign for the future.“The fact that we had two girls that were willing to fence foil, when they don’t really fence foil and were trying their hardest to do well even though they don’t have much time to train, is really impressive,” Loon said. “I was really proud to be part of the team.”In the final match of the day, the Crimson fell to the hosting No. 6 St. John’s team, 16-11. The Red Storm swept Harvard, winning the foil, 6-3, and the sabre and epee, 5-4.Epee proved to be the strongest event for the Crimson, with two fencers, van Loon, and sophomore Emma Vaggo, each winning eight bouts.“I would say my performance was really up and down just because it was the hardest tournament ever because there were so many strong teams that show up,” van Loon said.Freshman Aliya Itzkowitz also recorded eight wins in her event, the sabre.The No. 6 men’s team opened the Invitational with Harvard’s sole win, an 18-9 defeat of No. 7 Columbia.“The Columbia sabre team is very strong,” freshman Duncan O’Brien said. “It includes two highly ranked junior members. They’re a very experienced team and it was great how well we fenced against them.”

As the men’s ice hockey season got into full swing in early November, no one would have thought both Harvard and St. Lawrence—then ranked No. 14 and 13, respectively—would hold losing records in the ECAC come January.The Crimson began the season ranked No. 17 in the nation after recruiting what was considered to be the top freshman class in the country. Opening the season on a three-game win streak, Harvard had moved up to No. 13 by late October.St. Lawrence began the season unranked but quickly picked up national attention after sweeping six of seven games to open the season. Both teams were ranked for three straight weeks, but after poor performances in November, they quickly fell out of contention.Battling into overtime on Saturday, the Crimson and the Saints were locked in a 3-3 tie after Harvard fought back from a 2-0 deficit. But St. Lawrence took control in the overtime period and netted a sudden death goal to end the contest.St. Lawrence now sits in seventh place in the ECAC, while Harvard rests at the bottom of the 12-team conference.
IT’S EASY FOR VESEYWhile the return of freshman forward Jimmy Vesey has been unable to snap the team’s six-game losing streak, Vesey has reasserted himself as an offensive powerhouse.After missing three games in late December and early January representing the United States at the world junior hockey championship, Vesey’s presence has been crucial in putting pucks in the net.“Well, I think he’s been excellent,” Crimson coach Ted Donato said. “I thought tonight he was tremendous. He was a threat every time he was on the ice, and I think he gave us a big lift.”Vesey has netted four goals in the last three games—including two against the Saints—and leads Harvard with ten goals on the season. On Saturday, Vesey singlehandedly brought the Crimson back into contention with two consecutive goals to tie up the score early in the second period.“The second one was a beautiful play by both Blackwell and Hart,” Donato said. “We had a lot of guys step up, and certainly Jimmy was on the top of that list.”Vesey’s first goal came on a power play in the first period and was the only man-up opportunity that Harvard was able to convert. He tacked on his second goal eleven seconds into the next period.“We scored a power play goal tonight, and we struggled on power play in the past, and I think that’s good for us going forward,” Vesey said. “Also, we showed a lot of resilience coming back from 2-0 and 3-2, and I think that’s a positive going forward as well.”SHOTS FIREDWhile the Crimson matched the Saints with 14 shots apiece in the third period, it struggled in the first and second.

In its trip to the Coal State this weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball team struck gold on the first night but came up just short the day after.On Friday night in Loretto, Pa., the Crimson (3-1, 1-1 EIVA) opened conference play with a strong statement, downing Saint Francis (1-6, 0-1) in straight sets.Despite suffering an early setback with an injury to sophomore outside hitter DJ White, Harvard managed to pull out each set and preserve its undefeated record.“It was big. It was our first league win,” said junior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper. “It was nice to start with a ‘W’. We played a little bit sloppy in the beginning, but we cleaned it up and settled through pretty much the rest of the game. To get a win after a little adversity like that felt good.”The Crimson faced a much tougher opponent in No. 6 Penn State on Saturday afternoon. Although Harvard battled to force a deciding fifth game in University Park, Pa., the Nittany Lions (9-1, 2-0) ultimately prevailed to seal the 3-2 Crimson defeat.
“It’s a loss to a good team,” said junior co-captain Nick Madden. “I think it showed us exactly what it’s going to take to get out there and compete and win our league. That’s going to be serves, serve receiving, and swinging high and hard off the block.”PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 2When Harvard captured the fourth set by a score of 25-16 to even the match at two sets apiece, the Crimson looked to have Penn State on the ropes.But a strong Nittany Lions squad stormed right back in the final game, jumping out to an early lead and never looking back en route to a 15-6 win that sealed the conference showdown.Harvard registered a game-high 13 kills in the fourth set, but strong serves from Penn State forced the Crimson into a defensive position in the fifth. The team mustered only a single kill in the game.“I think the biggest [problem] was our serve receive,” Madden said. “We had a couple hitting errors, but I think for the most part they served really well, and we didn’t really put hittable balls up. I don’t think it was so much attacking in the fifth game as it was defense and receiving.”A number of players came up big for Harvard on the offensive end. Madden contributed solid play in multiple aspects of the game, ranking first on the team with nine kills and also posting seven digs and six blocks.Junior outside hitter Michael Owen and sophomore middle blocker Caleb Zimmick followed closely behind Madden with eight kills apiece, and freshman outside hitter Branden Clemens had seven kills from the perimeter.“[Our attacking depth] helps us a lot,” Madden said. “We definitely were able to capitalize in the middle tonight. Our middles absolutely killed it. It makes it really hard on the defense because if they’re one-on-one blocking everywhere, we have a much higher-percentage chance of getting kills.”Penn State managed to snatch a tight first set by a score of 25-23, but the Crimson battled back in the second game to even the score at one set apiece. The teams split the third and fourth games to set up the decisive fifth.

This weekend the women of Harvard Track and Field competed in meets from Boston to Texas, notching high finishes in early season outings.The events were the team’s first away competitions and many freshmen made their collegiate road debuts.""I think everybody’s learning about themselves,” freshman Autumne Franklin said. “I think these early-season meets are mostly learning experiences, and that’s what they’re there for…. You always get better because you learn about yourself and how to fix things and tweak this and tweak that to make yourself a greater athlete.”BU Terrier InvitationalThe Crimson traveled across town to the BU Track and Tennis Center for the BU Terrier Invitational on Friday and Saturday, where the team turned in a variety of results.
In a close race, the Harvard ‘A’ team won the 4x400m relay race with a time of 3:44.08, eclipsing a quad from the University of Connecticut by 0.43 seconds. The finish was less than a second from the school record. The winning group included two freshmen, Franklin and Christi Scott, while the ‘B’ team, which placed 13th among the 41 entries, included three rookies, Ali Monfre, Julia Kee and Madison Hansen.“The four-by-four is one of those bookend events,” Harvard coach Jared Saretsky said. “It almost always ends the meet. We take a lot of pride in having a strong one, and they’ve been working really hard. I know they’re excited to take another crack at the school record.”The Crimson also raced itself onto the podium in the 400m dash. Sophomore Gabrielle Scott raced to third place in 55.34 seconds. Franklin trailed her by 0.78 seconds and finished in fifth.“I kind of stepped out of my comfort zone for the first time in a while and so I’m proud of myself for that,” Franklin said. “My four-by-four split was better than my open four because I ran a smarter race in the four-by-four, but at least I know I can actually do it in my open four. I sort of got out too hard in my four hundred and couldn’t maintain it in the end.”Veteran Sydnie Leroy cleared 3.70 meters to take second play in the pole vault behind Claire Dishong of Cornell. The senior was just short of her personal best of 3.80m, the height Dishong achieved to win the competition.Harvard found another second place finisher in sophomore Molly Renfer. Renfer completed the 800m run in 2:09.53, just under a second slower than winner Lorain McKenzie, an unattached runner who graduated from the University of Florida in 2008. Renfer was joined in the top ten by freshman Paige Kouba whose time of 2:11.58 placed her in sixth.Sophomore Ashley Collinsworth was three places from the finals of the 60m dash, which only allows a field of nine runners.  She raced to a twelfth place finish in 7.86 seconds, .10 seconds off her personal best. Texas A&amp;M Mondo ChallengeA pair of Harvard women captured top-five finishes in the pentathlon at the Texas A&amp;M Mondo Challenge on Friday and Saturday at the Gilliam Indoor Track Stadium in College Station, Tex.Freshman Martina Salander finished second overall with 4094 points out of a field of seven competitors and was followed in fourth by senior Mary Hirst with 3583 points. Senior Keia Pinnick of Arizona State University, who led with 4208 points, won the field. Pinnick won four of the five events in the competition.Salander won the shot put event. Her second throw of 13.59m launched her ahead of the competition. She put the shot 1.43m further than the second place finisher, sophomore Annie Kunz of Texas A&amp;M. Hirst rounded out the top three with a throw of 12.03m.Salander notched second place finishes in the 800m run and the long jump and was third in the 60m hurdles and high jump. Hirst leapt into second place in the high jump, clearing 1.72m and trailed her teammate in the other events, placing fourth in the long jump, fifth in the 800m run and sixth in the 60m hurdles.“I would say I was really pleased with how both performed,” Saretsky said. “It was a great opportunity to go out to Texas and face some national level competition. Mary came away with a lifetime best and Martina broke our school record and is believe, now ranked third in the country so not too shabby.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

The Harvard women’s basketball team turned the ball over 28 times and shot one-of-19 from deep Saturday in Hanover, N.H., posting its lowest point total of the season in a 58-45 loss to Dartmouth. In its last game two weeks ago, the Crimson (10-5, 1-1 Ivy) tallied its highest score of the year in an 88-66 victory over the same Big Green (3-13, 1-1 Ivy).“I am shocked,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I did not expect such poor offensive performance. Our shooting was shockingly bad, which is very uncharacteristic of us.”Junior Christine Clark led all scorers with 22 points. She posted the same tally in the last matchup, but this time it wasn’t enough as no other Harvard player finished in double figures. Sophomore Temi Fagbenle brought down 10 rebounds and accrued eight points but the rest of the team outside of her and Clark only made slightly more than 20 percent of its shots.Senior Victoria Lippert and co-captain Emma Golen, the team’s second and fifth-highest scorers on the year, respectively, combined to shoot two-for-14, including zero-for-nine from three-point range.“Our spacing wasn’t good, our timing wasn’t good, and our shooting wasn’t good,” Delaney-Smith said. “A lot of the shots were pretty good shots that didn’t fall that otherwise usually fall.”
Harvard’s inability to rebound consistently on the offensive end made matters worse.“It’s just unfortunate that two of our very best shooters had a tough night tonight but we have to be able to back them up… and get offensive rebounds and get them second chances,” co-captain Miriam Rutzen said. “We weren’t really able to do that consistently tonight. It was one shot per possession on the offensive end.”Outside of its shooting performance, the visiting squad did enough to protect its six-game winning streak against Dartmouth. The Crimson held the Big Green to 31 percent shooting, out-rebounded its hosts, 42-30, and only gave up four fast break points despite tallying 28 turnovers.“Defensively we did fine, we did great,” Delaney-Smith said. “We would have held them to the low-40s if we didn’t have to foul at the end. So it was not the defense; we were absolutely horrible on the offensive end.”Thanks to its stingy defense, Harvard nearly overcame its poor shooting late in the game. The Crimson hadn’t held a lead since the score was 9-8, but a Clark layup cut the deficit to 44-38 with just under four minutes to play, the smallest Dartmouth’s lead had been in over 10 minutes. After watching their male counterparts erase a large lead in a comeback victory earlier Saturday, the Harvard women knew the game was not lost.“We never gave up,” Rutzen said. “Our toughness is key, and our willingness to keep fighting through despite adversity was evident.”But the squad proved incapable of recreating the men’s afternoon success. The teams traded baskets and free throws to move the score to 47-41, but Golen and freshman Shilpa Tummula missed threes on the Crimson’s next two possessions while the Big Green sunk free throws to extend its lead on the other end.Clark added two late buckets but it wasn’t enough as Dartmouth iced the game with 11 straight made free throws, beating Harvard for the first time since 2010. A number of those charity-stripe conversions came from junior Nicola Zimmer, who tallied a team-high 18 points on the night after missing her team’s previous three matchups, including its first contest against the Crimson.“She was their absolute emotional leader,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a nice player, she’s important to them.”Whether it was Zimmer’s return, the change of venue, or another factor that caused the different result, it was clear from the start that Saturday’s matchup would share few similarities with the two teams’ prior engagement.Whereas Harvard jumped out to a 10-2 lead early two weeks ago, it was Dartmouth who grabbed a 7-1 advantage Saturday. The Crimson erased that early deficit but couldn’t keep up with the Big Green over the full 40 minutes.“They just took chances, they were physical—they had absolutely nothing to lose and that’s how they played, and we played exactly the opposite,” Delaney-Smith said. “No matter what I could do, no matter who I put in, we just stayed tight.”While it is still early in the season, the loss hurts Harvard’s ability to achieve its goal of dethroning three-time Ivy champion Princeton. The Crimson still controls its own destiny, but will now need to defeat the Tigers twice to earn the conference crown or hope that another Ancient Eight squad knocks off a Princeton team that notched its 25th straight conference victory with a 74-44 beat down of Penn Saturday.—Staff writer Jacob D.

Traveling halfway across the country for the ITA Kick-Off, the Harvard men’s tennis team split its matches on the weekend in Norman, Okla.All four teams participating—the Crimson, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and Memphis—were among the top 32 teams in the nation.“Our weekend was terrific,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “We came out a little bit banged up, which is not anything a coach gets wildly excited about, but we competed really hard and had some really good performances.”The No. 28 Crimson opened up against the No. 30 Fighting Irish (3-2), and rode consistent production in both singles and doubles to a 4-3 victory.But despite the close win against an evenly matched opponent, Harvard ended its weekend on a sour note, falling to No. 8 Oklahoma without taking a match.
“Overall, it was really good play, but [the Sooners were] just better,” Fish said. “They deserve to go to the national indoor team championships two weeks from now in Washington.”OKLAHOMA 4, HARVARD 0After taking down Notre Dame the day prior, Harvard  was easily beaten by Oklahoma, 4-0, Sunday afternoon.“This team was definitely a cut higher than [the Fighting Irish],” Fish said. “It was fun—I was watching our guys grow in front of my eyes. They were getting some balls that we weren’t used to seeing, and we would get beaten the first time, and then the second time we’d adjust.”The Sooners sealed their spot in the Round of 16 in the ITA Championships when Guillermo Alcorta posted a 6-4, 6-3 singles victory over sophomore Alex Steinroeder in the No. 2 match, giving Oklahoma the clinching fourth point to complete the shutout.Already down by one after a forfeit due to injury, the Crimson lost another singles point when freshman Kelvin Lam lost in two straight sets, 2-6, 0-6.“Kelvin played some tough people, so he was a little overmatched,” Fish said. “And [sophomore] Shaun Chaudhuri and Alex Steinroeder played one and two with [sophomore] Denis Nguyen out of the lineup, and they played great tennis.”Chaudhuri and freshmen Nicky Hu and Conor Haughey began their singles matches but neither finished once the Sooners gained their fourth points to seal their victory.In doubles play, the Oklahoma duo of Costin Paval and Dane Webb opened up the day with an 8-4 win over Chaudhuri and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster. Freshman Nicholas Mahlangu and Steinroeder also tasted defeat at the hands of Peerakit Siributwong and Leonard Stakhovsky, dropping the match, 8-5.HARVARD 4, NOTRE DAME 3

In the mountains behind the football stadium in Berkeley, Calif., lies a narrow dirt path that the students call Fire Trails. It snakes up in switchbacks to the very top, where the view takes away whatever panting breath I have left. The whole Bay Area slopes down before me and in the distance I can make out the faded red geometry of the Golden Gate Bridge.I have never felt quite at home on the West Coast. I prefer the historical chill of Philadelphia to California’s sunny sheen, have always been drawn to Hemingway more than Steinbeck. During this trip, though, I’m thinking about beginnings and endings and I feel the place’s tug. I’m reading On the Road, the original scroll:It was the end of the continent, no more land. Somebody had tipped the American continent like a pinball machine and all the goofballs had come rolling to L.A. in the southwest corner. I cried for all of us.San Francisco is different than L.A., but the two cities share a statewide simpatico. Is it the feeling of achievement—a country crossed and conquered—that I’m sensing here, even today on our smaller shrunken continent? A kind of relief at a journey completed or a frontier traversed?It is the first week of Berkeley’s second semester, and one of the friends I am visiting is distraught over classes. She only has one English course left in her Berkeley career and she must choose between Borges and Virginia Woolf. She’s read Woolf and loves her, yet she’s also feeling an almost mystical Argentine pull. We sit in the Free Speech Movement Café deliberating. We return to her house, the African-American culture themed co-op near the entrance to Fire Trails, to deliberate some more with most of the co-op’s 21 other inhabitants pulled into the debate. It is P.’s turn to cook dinner and the conversations continue during her three-hour shift in the industrial kitchen, shifting sometimes up onto the roof for more beery deliberation.

At school I would never take three hours out of my day each week to cook dinner. Would things have been different if I’d gone to college here? The friends I am visiting love Berkeley with its classes and Co-ops, the deeply moral significance they place here on high-quality public education. They are desperately sad to graduate. I know I will not be. Would things be different here? Is this just another way of asking how I could be different, here or anywhere?One day we take a car and drive down to Santa Cruz. We dip our feet into the Pacific and eat honey-almond ice cream on the softly groaning boardwalk. We talk about future jobs and plans and cities, how graduation’s the last real ending we’ll all share, how the lack of a next ending unnerves us all.There was no end to the American sadness and the American madness. Someday we’ll all start laughing and roll on the ground when we realize how funny it’s been.I watch the sun ease down over the ocean and think about how long it took to get here, historically, and all the disasters since the ending of that old American saga. Did Kerouac feel it, too?

In its 5-2 loss to William and Mary (4-1) on Friday, the Harvard women’s tennis team (1-1) tried a variety of approaches in trying to claw out a couple of singles matches. However, after taking the doubles’ point, the team lost five of six singles matches as Crimson players varied their strategies in trying to battle back from early breaks off their serves.On court five, junior Natalie Blosser blasted groundstrokes off each wing past her Tribe opponent but ceded break advantages in each set in a 6-3, 7-5 loss. Freshman Amanda Lin faced similar obstacles over on court three. Lin sliced the ball low and away to keep her opponent off-balance, venturing into the net to keep points shorter, but was unable to put enough pressure on her opponent with her serve and forehand and fell 6-3, 6-2.Against a net-rusher who came in off both serves and returns, co-captain Kristin Norton consistently tried different passing combinations—working in both topspin lobs and flatter groundstrokes—but was broken at key junctures in each set.  Norton lost the match, 6-4, 6-3.“I thought it was a very solid second match of the season,” coach Traci Green said. “We competed really well for the second match of the season and I’m really proud of the heart that we showed today. Our team showed a lot of composure here today for early and the season and we won a lot of the big points we played in doubles.”Harvard’s lone win in singles came courtesy of freshman Crystal Yen, who lost only three games in defeating William and Mary junior Sydney Smith, 6-0, 6-3. Yen, who uses an unorthodox style of play to keep her opponents off balance and force them to play balls outside of their comfort zones, frustrated her opponent into frequent errors off both wings.
“Crystal is a very deceiving player and a very annoying player to play,” Green said. “She’s very fast and can get everything back and sometimes she can give you no pace and sometimes she can give you a lot of pace. Crystal is a very hard worker and she never gives up. When you have someone like that, you know you’ve got a good player.”In doubles, the Crimson started slow before finishing strong. After co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amy He dropped line one doubles, 8-0, Harvard fought back from 6-6 ties in both matches to break their Tribe opponents and served out the contests. Norton and He were the only team to stay intact from the team’s victory over Cleveland State, as the Crimson displayed two new doubles teams against William and Mary.“In doubles I think that we all played pretty well,” sophomore Sylvia Li said. “Coach was in our ear telling us ‘believe, believe’ and I think we all did that pretty well. When you play with [a new partner], you definitely want to have high energy and make sure you talk all the time before and after points.”Li said that after the match against Cleveland State, where Harvard dropped only one set and swept every match played, the level of competition was significantly stiffer against William and Mary. While the Crimson was not able to pull out more than one singles match, only two of the 10 sets the team lost were by more than a break of serve.“Because our first match was a lot easier than this one it showed us that we still have to keep working hard and improving,” Li said. “They were a really solid team and if we keep practicing we can beat teams this good if not better. [The match] was a good watch to keep us on track.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Over the weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team (1-2) lost consecutive 5-2 matches to William and Mary (4-2) and Kansas State (1-0). In both matches, the Crimson trailed by only one after the first three matches but then was not able to close out tight matches, losing four of the last five matches both time. The two losses were the first of the year for Harvard.WILLIAM AND MARY 5, HARVARD 2In its loss to William and Mary on Friday, Harvard tried a variety of approaches in trying to claw out a couple of singles matches. However, after taking the doubles point, the team lost five of six singles matches as Crimson players varied their strategies in trying to battle back from early breaks of their serves.On court five, junior Natalie Blosser blasted groundstrokes off each wing past her Tribe opponent but ceded break advantages in each set in a 6-3, 7-5 loss.

In doubles, the Crimson started slow before finishing strong. After Norton and freshman Amy He dropped line one doubles, 8-0, Harvard fought back from 6-6 ties in the two other matches to break their Tribe opponents and serve out the contests.""In doubles I think that we all played pretty well,” sophomore Sylvia Li said. “Coach was in our ear telling us ‘believe, believe’ and I think we all did that pretty well.”KANSAS STATE 5, HARVARD 2The iconic moment of the Harvard women’s tennis match against Kansas State came at the end of the doubles session. With Harvard trailing 1-0 and down match point on court one, line three teammates co-captain Hideko Tachibana and junior Hannah Morill reached triple match point with a smash. As the two moved back to the baseline, they turned around to find their opponents walking off the court. The line one Wildcats unit had just won, giving the team the doubles point and depriving the Crimson of a chance to finish the match.In irritation, Tachibana approached the net and called out “Really guys? Come on!” The moment of frustration, which rattled the team, boiled over into the singles, where the Crimson came very close but was denied at crucial junctures in each match.At line one, Norton fought back from a set down and held four break points in the key seventh game of the third set. However, her opponent proceeded to save every point and broke Norton quickly, subsequently holding to secure the third set, 6-3. At line three, Li battled back after losing the first set 6-0 and held a break lead in the second set before being broken twice, losing 6-4.Harvard’s most unorthodox player—freshman Crystal Yen—lost only three games on Friday in defeating William and Mary junior Sydney Smith, but fell Sunday, 6-2, 6-4, to an opponent who was willing to play Yen’s game.Yen typically keeps her opponents off balance with high topspin and relentless consistency, but while Smith was frustrated into frequent errors off both wings, her Sunday opponent matched Yen stroke for stroke in 50-ball rallies that led to a 90-minute first set.“Crystal is a very deceiving player and a very annoying player to play,” Green said. “She’s very fast and can get everything back and sometimes she can give you no pace and sometimes she can give you a lot of pace. Crystal is a very hard worker and she never gives up. When you have someone like that, you know you’ve got a good player.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Although divisions over the Affordable Care Act persist along party lines, there is widespread public support for the extension and revision of Medicare, according to a recent joint survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and two partner organizations.Fifty-eight percent of individuals surveyed in the study said they oppose any spending cuts to Medicare, even as 65 percent of respondents said that America needs to tighten its fiscal belt to bring down the deficit.When asked specifically about proposals to trim the cost of Medicare, 85 percent of people surveyed said they support requiring drug companies to subsidize medication at a lower cost for low-income people. Fifty-nine percent of respondents voiced support for mandating high-income seniors to pay higher premiums for Medicare, which provides health insurance to seniors and people with certain disabilities.Proposals that would require all seniors to pay higher Medicare premiums and raise the age of Medicare eligibility were both rejected by a majority of surveyed individuals.The survey found greater differences of opinion on the issues of expanding Medicaid—which provides health insurance for the poor and people with certain disabilities—and modifying the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care reform law that was passed in 2010.In total, fifty-two percent of surveyed Americans said they wanted their state to expand its Medicaid program. But while this proposal drew support from 75 percent of Democrats surveyed, it was backed by only 34 percent of Republicans.
And while 52 percent of people surveyed said they thought the Affordable Care Act should be modified to lessen the tax impact on citizens, companies, and health care providers, that proposal drew support primarily from Republicans, who endorsed it by a nearly 4 to 1 ratio.The survey was conducted by phone by researchers from the School of Public Health, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.John E. McDonough, a professor of the practice of public health at the School of Public Health who was not involved in conducting the study, said that part of the ideological division over the law stems from differing views on the proper role of government in society. McDonough, who assisted the Senate as a policy adviser during a two-year stint on Capitol Hill when the law was being developed and passed, said he did not believe there was “any agreement” about government-run insurance programs in today’s society.“Limited government is in the eyes of the beholder,” McDonough said. McDonough said that disagreement over the Affordable Care Act also stems from differences in opinion about the role private insurance companies should play in distributing medical care.—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Christian Webster’s group of treys down the stretch that helped the Harvard men’s basketball team pull off a comeback overtime victory against Dartmouth garnered the co-captain top honors this week, but The Back Page would like to recognize other Crimson athletes who posted similarly impressive showings over the last week.
Freshman Christian Carbone, Men’s Swimming
Swimming against Notre Dame and Townson at the Shamrock Invitational this weekend, the freshman broke two records at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. Carbone set a new pool record in the 400 IM, touching the final wall in 3:52:34, shattering his personal best by more than four seconds. He set another personal record in the 200 fly, an event that Harvard swept en route to its sixth-consecutive victory to remain unbeaten on the year.
Freshman Martina Salander, Women’s Track and Field
 
While half of her team traveled across town to BU to take on teams at the Terrier Invitational, this freshman and the remainder of the track and field team headed south to the Texas A&amp;M Challenge, where Salander proceeded to make history. With over 4094 points in the pentathlon, Salander not only placed second at the meet, she broke a seven-year Harvard record and now holds the top Ivy League mark. At the meet, the rookie reached the podium in all five events, including a first-place finish in the shot put.<a name=""jump"">
Sophomore Jonah Travis, Men’s Basketball
Although Travis didn’t score during the final three minutes of regulation or in overtime, the forward played a key role in keeping Harvard within striking distance for the first 37 minutes. While the rest of the team went 18 for 44 on the day, the sophomore netted seven of his nine attempts to score 16 points, 10 of which came in the first half. With 14 points in the pain, Travis led the offensive effort from the inside, where the Crimson outscored the Big Green, 40-34.
Junior Kalley Armstrong, Women’s Hockey
While the men’s hockey team was skating to an overtime loss against St. Lawrence at home, Armstrong was making sure that the women’s team would have a different outcome. A little over two minutes into the extra period, junior forward Lyndsey Fry recovered a rebound and powered it to Armstrong, who slid it past the Saints’ goaltender to lift Harvard to a 3-2 victory. The junior, who tallied her eighth goal against St. Lawrence, also scored the Crimson’s only goal in the loss to Clarkson on the day before.

Delivering the keynote speech at a symposium Friday on the future of computation, hedge fund founder and scientist David E. Shaw predicted that researchers will increasingly rely on high-speed simulation to probe biological questions.“One of the key questions is... how does simulation actually fit into the role of the scientific method?” Shaw asked a packed audience in Maxwell Dworkin.“I think we are going to get to the point where people see [biomolecular simulations] as a piece of evidence in the same way that they do experiments,” he concluded later in his talk.Shaw, who founded the D. E. Shaw Group in 1988 and now serves as chief scientist at D. E. Shaw Research, also called for a more prominent role for computers in confirming existing theories and opening up new hypotheses in biology.He highlighted three applications of high-speed biological computing, including studying proteins and identifying appropriate pharmaceuticals for particular cases.
To illustrate the progress that has already been made, Shaw presented a high-speed supercomputer called Anton specifically designed by his research group for a class of problems called molecular dynamics simulations.His research group has used Anton to stage simulations that have resulted in new insights into the protein folding process.“We don’t know enough at this point to know what the limitations are,” Shaw said. “I think we have to convince ourselves.”Nilesh Tripuraneni ’13, a physics concentrator who attended Shaw’s talk, said he had heard of Shaw’s hedge fund but was not as familiar with his current work in scientific computation.“I know a lot of fundamental research that people do, but I’m not as knowledgeable about these applications of high-power computing,” Tripuraneni said. “I thought it was amazing that they were able to reproduce a lot of results about protein folding through their simulations.”Shaw’s address was followed by six other presentations about the ways computing can be used to advance neuroscience, chip design, urban planning, and other disciplines. Steven E. Koonin, director of New York University’s Center for Urban Science and Progress, presented a vision of using real-time data sensors to inform decisions made by city officials about traffic flow, public health, and infrastructure planning.“We’re getting very good at sensing, transmitting, storing, analyzing enormous amounts of data,” Koonin said. “Big data can be brought to bear on societal problems.”Friday’s symposium capped off a series of Wintersession offerings—including a student computational <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/25/foosball-coders-SEAS-compute/"">challenge—organized by the Institute for Applied Computational Science.Efthimios Kaxiras, professor of pure and applied physics and director of the Institute, said he hoped the events would educate and connect students and faculty.“All of this is to foster a computational culture and community here at Harvard,” he said.—Staff writer Brian C.

Dartmouth’s decision to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/education/dartmouth-stops-credits-for-excelling-on-ap-test.html?ref=education"">stop accepting top scores on Advanced Placement exams as stand-ins for introductory-level classes starting with the Class of 2018 reflects recent skepticism around the A.P. exams’ ability to prepare high school students for college.MIT <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/education/edlife/09ap-t.html?pagewanted=all"">felt similarly in 2007 when they deemed that students who had earned a five on the A.P. Biology exam did not necessarily have the skills required to succeed in upper-level Biology courses.Dartmouth decided to change their A.P. policy after the psychology department designed an experiment to test how incoming freshmen that had scored a five on their A.P. psychology test compared to students who have completed the introductory-level psychology class. The department created a condensed version of the class’s final and administered it to the incoming freshman. Ninety percent of the students who had earned a five on the A.P exam failed.We believe that the Dartmouth psychology department’s experiment exposes a flaw in the A.P. scoring system rather than a fundamental problem with the idea of earning credit for high school work.  Test takers who receive fives on an A.P. exam may have vastly differing levels of understanding of the subject material.  In order to serve our nation’s wide spectrum of colleges and universities, the A.P. system would be more useful if there were a more sensitive scale than just one through five.The A.P. exam has experienced incredible <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-17/national/36410725_1_exams-for-college-credit-final-exam-introductory-class"">expansion in recent years, with two million students taking 3.7 million exams last year, more than doubling enrollment in a decade. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/education/29class.html?ref=advancedplacementprogram"">Seventy-five percent of teachers polled in 2009 believed school administrators looking to improve the school’s reputation and ranking were pushing students into A.P. courses. The A.P. exam distributes the grades based on the distribution of test scores. Thus with the increasing number of potentially unprepared students taking the test, the threshold for earning a four and five is lowered.  A more sensitive scale would allow students and universities to have a better understanding of whether a given student is prepared for upper-level classes.
We believe that the decision to eliminate the ability to graduate early by using high school credit is an especially important and serious one considering the debt burden borne by so many students. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kate Lyon, a 2005 Dartmouth graduate, <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-17/national/36410725_1_exams-for-college-credit-final-exam-introductory-class"">disagrees with her alma mater’s policy change, as she appreciated being able to save $15,000 by using her A.P. credit. It is unfair to deprive future ambitious students from seizing the opportunity to graduate early.The A.P. program clearly has much room for improvement, but with student loan delinquency <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/49983471/StudentLoan_Delinquencies_Now_Surpass_Credit_Cards"">exceeding credit card delinquency for the first time ever, Dartmouth’s decision seems inadequately justified. We encourage Dartmouth and other universities to support improvements to the A.P. exam, such as a more sensitive grading scale, but hope that they continue to honor high school accomplishments.

After weeks away for winter break, students trickled back to find warm solace and excitement amidst the frigid weather in Cambridge: new restaurants in Harvard Square! Among them was OSUSHI, a modern Japanese restaurant serving everything from tempura and sushi rolls to the small bites typically served at an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya"">Izakaya. OSUSHI, which opened in mid-December, also has a sister establishment at in Boston.<!--more-->From its expansive menu, the Ramen ($14) and Gomoku Chirashi ($15) offered a balance between warm and cold. The pork broth ramen, topped with pickled daikon, seaweed, boiled egg, and sesame seeds, had two choices of topping: pork belly or mentaiko, also known as marinated pollack roe. The broth of the ramen had coagulated pork fat floating on the surface, which had to be scooped out with a spoon. The noodle was slightly overcooked; instead of being chewy, it melted and disappeared in the mouth. The salty, fishy flavor of the mentaiko was a bit overpowering and did not balance well with the rich pork broth.The bowl of Gomoku Chirashi contained an assortment of diced pieces of seafood such as tuna, hamachi, saba, and shrimp, as well as tamago (egg), salmon roe, and cucumber over a bed of seasoned sushi rice. It was difficult to taste the texture and freshness of the fish from the finely chopped sashimi, which should have been more thickly cut. Also, the ratio between toppings and rice was a bit skewed.Although the dining experience at OSUSHI was not stupendous, perhaps a visit to its Copley location will change this reviewer's mind.

Sundance Film Festival recognized the artistic achievements of several Harvard filmmakers at this year’s festival. The group of filmmakers spans several generations of involvement with Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies Department, and many say their VES experience contributed to their success.Michael Almereyda—a director who previously served as a visiting VES lecturer—won The Short Film Jury Award in non-fiction for “Skinningrove,” his profile of photographer and Harvard VES professor Chris Killip.Roberto “Pacho” F. Velez ’02-03, one of two VES teaching assistants who helped with the film’s production, said the opportunities given to fledgling filmmakers at VES, and Harvard more broadly, help to shape world-class talent.""Harvard has the best everything—the best biologists, the best philosophers,” said Velez. ""They also have some of the best filmmakers and film teachers.”In Almereyda’s film, Killip discusses his photos chronicling the lives of people who live in a remote English fishing village.“I’ve never known what to do with [the photographs],” said Killip, who added that few of the photos had been published prior to the film. “Now, they’ve ended up with a different life as a film.”
The documentary “Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer,” directed by Mike Lerner and GSAS graduate and research fellow Maxim Pozdorovkin, also won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award for Punk Spirit at Sundance. The film chronicles the legal trial of the punk band Pussy Riot, whose members were arrested last year after storming a Russian cathedral and performing their religious protest song “A Punk Prayer.”According to Pozdorovkin, the movie deals with the unique “feminist revolution” encouraged by Pussy Riot through a melding of political activism and contemporary music.In the short film genre, VES graduate Damien S. Chazelle ’07 won The Short Film Jury Award in U.S. fiction for “Whiplash,” which tells the story of a drummer who aspires to rise through the ranks at a top conservatory’s jazz orchestra.The film’s production brought together several generations of VES affiliates. Chazelle credits his experiences at VES with preparing him for an artistic career.“I had a fantastic experience with VES,” said Chazelle, who plans to turn the short into a feature-length film in the future. “It defined who I am as a filmmaker now.”VES alumnus Andrew J. Bujalski ’98 won this year’s Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film prize for “Computer Chess,” a black-and-white comedy about the relationships formed among the competitors at a 1980s computer chess tournament.—Staff writer Brianna D.

It started out as a game co-captain Christian Webster would rather not remember.Through the first 38 minutes of Saturdays’ contest between the Harvard men’s basketball team and Dartmouth, the senior was shooting one of six from beyond the arc.That’s when things turned around—in a big way.Webster nailed three three-pointers in the final 93 seconds of regulation, leading the Crimson back from a late 10-point deficit to force overtime. Webster tacked on an assist, block, and rebound in the extra period, and Harvard pulled out an 82-77 victory.“I’m at a loss for words right now,” Webster said after the game.
With the Crimson trailing by 10, 57-47, and 1:42 remaining, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker drew up a play for Webster coming out of a timeout.After sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi set a screen for freshman point guard Siyani Chambers at the top of the key, Webster’s defender left him to defend Moundou-Missi as he rolled to the basket. Chambers found Webster open on the wing, and the senior drilled the triple.Amaker called Webster’s number again with the Crimson trailing by six with 47 ticks left. This time, Webster received an off-ball screen from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard as he cut to the top of the key and received a pass from sophomore Wesley Saunders. With a hand in his face, Webster drilled the three to pull the Crimson within three.On its next possession, Harvard ran the same play, and Webster again came through.“We executed brilliantly,” Amaker said. “I thought Siyani and Wesley did a great job of executing the passes and the plays to get Christian the ball. And Laurent made an incredible screen to get Christian open. And obviously all those things have to happen and then Christian’s got to make a shot and he did.”Saturday’s contest was not the first time that Webster came up in the clutch for the Crimson.As a rookie, Webster drilled an and-one three-pointer with 12 seconds remaining to pull the Crimson within one of Princeton. (Harvard ended up falling by three after then-senior Jeremy Lin ’10 missed a contested three-pointer at the end of regulation).As a sophomore, Webster played a critical role in the Crimson’s 24-point comeback against Brown at Lavietes Pavilion. After opening the game 0 for 8 from the field, Webster scored 18 points in the final 15:50, shooting four of four from beyond the arc. Webster’s final triple gave the Crimson a 68-66 advantage with 7:40 remaining, and Harvard led the rest of the way.TRAVISHarvard’s offensive numbers at halftime were atrocious.

Harvard scored one goal in the first three minutes of the night, but nothing after. Stunned by a two-goal outburst in a matter of nine seconds near the end of the second period, the Crimson could not recover in the third, falling 5-1 Friday night to ECAC rival Clarkson (5-12-6, 4-5-2 ECAC) at the Bright Hockey Center.The Harvard men’s hockey team (5-11-1, 3-10-0 ECAC) dropped its fifth straight, cementing its place at the bottom of the standings with six points in ECAC play. In this five game span the Crimson has not scored a power-play goal, going zero for 20 in the process.“Ultimately I think we have to be able to be more productive on the power play,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “The power play to me cost us an opportunity to get two points tonight.”Sophomore forward Joe Zarbo recorded a hat trick for the Knights, netting the go-ahead goal in the second period to make it 2-1 as well as an empty netter to clinch the victory.Freshman Jimmy Vesey had the lone goal for the home team, scoring off a pass from sophomore Colin Blackwell just 2:34 into the first.
The Crimson started off well, with controlling play in the first 10 minutes, but could not muster much else for the rest of the night as the visitors netted five unanswered goals including three in the third to finish the game.Junior Raphael Girard had 34 saves for Harvard in the loss, while the Crimson finished zero for six on the power play in the first home game of 2013.“I think we’ve had trouble winning face-offs [on the power play] in their end which is huge for getting puck possession right off the bat and getting them on their heels,” Vesey said. “We haven’t won draws and [been able to] put a few passes together in a row to get them running around so we can open up a nice play.”With his goal, Vesey continued his campaign for rookie of the year, having now tallied eight goals and four assists, leading the team and ECAC freshman in points and goals. Fellow freshman Brian Hart is not far behind with four goals and nine points, tied for second in the league in freshman scoring.“I think we’ve had some chemistry and played well together,” Vesey said. “But I think that is a little overshadowed by the struggles we’ve had as a team; I’d trade us leading rookies in scoring any day.”Circling around from behind the net on the left side, Blackwell had the puck poked away from him, but it found Vesey near the Clarkson net on the left side, who put the puck past Knight goalie Greg Lewis. Hart was also credited with an assist.Harvard displayed solid offensive play in the first few minutes of the game, leading 9-2 in shots at one point, but Clarkson countered soon after killing the Crimson's lone power-play opportunity in period. The Knights ended the first period with 20 shots to Harvard's 14.The second period looked to be an uneventful one, until Clarkson’s rapid offensive burst in the closing minutes.For nearly 18 minutes, the two squads held each other to no goals highlighted by an impressive save by Girard. Knight junior forward Jarret Burton fired a shot that looked to trickle past Girard before the junior swept it away with his stick right before it crossed the goal line.Clarkson was able to kill three Crimson power plays in the second period as well, including a four-on-three opportunity.

The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team improved to a perfect 6-0 in dual meets on the season after picking up wins against Notre Dame and Towson this weekend. The Crimson faced one of its toughest tests of the season, going up against the No. 20 Fighting Irish squad.“It was great to swim against some very good competition and come away with a win,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “It really excited us and motivated us to see how fast we can go for the rest of the season.”Harvard steadily handled both non-conference opponents, topping Notre Dame with a 264-100 victory and taking down the Tigers with a 314-52 win.“[The meet] was a great opportunity to prove ourselves,” sophomore Chuck Katis said. “To beat [the Irish] on both days was great for us. Being a top-20 team is one of our goals this season. Our success at this meet really reinforced that goal. It was a milestone for us to be able to compete at that level.”In the team’s first swim of the night, the 400 medley relay squad of Jack Pretto, Katis, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite set a pool record with a time of 3:17.66, beating the rest of the competition by over two seconds. The Crimson picked up a bronze in the event as well, as Kyle McIntee, Owen Wurzbacher, Jacob Luna, and Will Brophy teamed for a time of 3:20.44 to finish in third.
“Both days, the team was very excited to swim fast and very excited to race against a really great Notre Dame team,” Roop said. “[Winning the opening relay] really got people excited, and we really never look back from there.”Led by some breakout swims from its freshman class, Harvard came away with victories in 16 of the meet’s 19 events.Rookie Christian Yeager won the 200 backstroke in a time of 1:48.28, with classmate Tyler Rocca closely behind. Rocca touched the wall shortly after Yeager, and the Crimson duo finished almost a full four seconds ahead of the next closest competitor.Rocca went on to later win the 100 backstroke in a time of 50.78. Harvard swept the podium in the event, as freshman Jacob Luna finished second and junior Jack Pretto rounded out the top-three.First-year Christian Carbone set a pool record in the 400 IM. His time of 3:52.34, over four seconds better than the second place finisher, was a personal best and good for an NCAA ‘B’ standard time. Carbone also picked up a win in the 200 butterfly with a time of 1:48.29.“We had a lot of great swims this weekend,” Katis said. “A lot of the freshmen really stepped up. I think every freshman had at least one or two great swims. I think across the board we had a lot of people step into the shoes they really needed to fill.”Katis failed to win the 100 breast for the first time this season, but the sophomore’s second-place time of 54.73 was still good enough for an NCAA ‘B’ standard.“I think everyone on the team is at different points rest-wise,” Katis said. “In my case, given the amount of work I’ve been doing, my times this weekend were some of the best I’ve had unrested, which was a great sign.”In one of the most dominant events of the meet, the Crimson swept the top five spots in the 200 freestyle. Satterthwaite led the charge with a time of 1:40.05, edging out sophomore Zachary Walters for the top spot by .19 seconds. Roop came in third with a time of 1:40.29, while sophomores Kyle McIntee and Griffin Schumacher rounded out the top five.The meet served as good preparation for the back end of Harvard’s conference schedule. The Crimson will face off this coming weekend against Yale and Princeton, and will face similarly stiff competition in the No. 23 Tigers.“I think this sets the tone for this weekend,” Katis said. “We are all very excited to go compete in Princeton’s home pool. I think we’re going to go in with a great win this [past] weekend behind [us].”But even with a tough Ivy League test at the front of its mind, Harvard also has its eyes set of greater success down the road at the Ivy and ECAC Championships.“It’s very encouraging to see people swim as fast as they did this weekend as we go into the final end of our season,” Roop said. “It’s really motivating to know that, physically, we are ready to swim fast. And if we approach the rest of the season with the proper attitude, then I think a lot of really good things will happen.”—Staff writer Brenna R.

The Harvard ski team raced to a ninth-place finish at the Colby Carnival, its third EISA competition of the season this weekend at Sugarloaf, Maine, and Waterville, Maine. The result was the second 9th-place finish in a row for the team, which competes in a field of 16.The Crimson pulled in 268 points as a team, trailing host Colby College’s 386 points and topping St. Michael’s College’s 238 points.The University of Vermont was the overall victor, with 962 points. Dartmouth College and the University of New Hampshire rounded out the top three.Harvard saw its strongest result overall in the women’s giant slalom. Junior Rebecca Nadler clipped nearly the whole slate of skiers for second place. She posted a total time of 1:45.71 over two runs.Her first run, at 52.50 seconds, was one of four sub-53-second finishes in the whole race.
“Conditions were extremely cold and extremely icy, so it was very, very challenging, and that suits Rebecca very well,” Harvard coach Tim Mitchell said. “She’s an extremely strong technical skier, and her skiing has been coming along week-by-week, getting a little bit better, a little bit better. It was encouraging not just that she finished second but [also that] she did that even with a couple of pretty good-sized mistakes.”Battling the weather, Nadler yet again came up short against University of Vermont junior Kate Ryley, who won last year’s national title in the Slalom.Ryley’s two runs were a combined 1.13 seconds faster than those of Nadler.“I was definitely happy with my results,” Nadler said.Nadler had the benefit of prior experience when she took to the slopes. “I actually skied at the hill where we raced for a year, so I had a little bit of a home-court advantage,” the Ottawa native said. “It was fun to be back, and I really like racing on that hill.”Catherine Sheils was the next finisher for the Crimson. The senior, who has recently been battling a back injury, notched a combined finish of 1:52.32.  Sophomore Elizabeth Strong was the final Harvard racer, placing 40th.Nadler was unable to record a high finish in the women’s Slalom event due to a major error in her second run. While a first run of 46.61 seconds placed her well within the top half of skiers, Nadler hit an edge towards the end of her second run and had to hike back up part of the mountain before finishing the course. Her time for the second run was 1:09.12, setting her back towards the end of the field. Freshman Samantha Udolf posted the top finish in the event for Harvard skiers, coming in at 44th.“She is skiing exponentially better than she ever has at any point in time in her previous ski racing,” Mitchell said. “She’s kind of one-upping herself every single time she’s out there, and so it’s really exciting to see her on such a steep improvement curve right now.”The Crimson also penetrated the top-ten team finishes in the two men’s cross-country events. In the 20k Freestyle MS on Sunday, Harvard’s two racers cracked the top 20 for 61 team points and a seventh place finish. Sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci finished the course in 48:12.3 for 10th place, while junior Chris Stock trailed by 42.2 seconds for 17th place.The day before, Maifeld-Carucci posted a team-high 25th place in the 10k Classic event with a time of 27:05 ,while Stock came in just 10 seconds later for 31st place in the field of 93. The Crimson also saw finishes from senior Anthony Ryerson and freshman Soren Anderson, who were 39th and 81st, respectively.Three freshmen on the men’s Alpine team completed tricky runs in the men’s Slalom event.“They did phenomenally well this weekend under some extremely challenging conditions,” Mitchell said. “In the Slalom, we actually had four guys qualify for the second run and that was tremendous.”Along with junior Ian Anderson, freshmen Matthew Mansson, Dan Rittenhouse, and Jack Stobierski all finished the event. Mansson was the team’s top finisher in 35th place with a total time of 1:32.94 over two runs. Anderson and Rittenhouse finished side by side in 43rd and 44th, respectively, while Stobierski closed the group in 46th place.“The guys are starting to see the fruits of their labor,” Mitchell said. “They’re starting to put it together. Having four guys get into the second run, having some solid results was really encouraging under extremely difficult circumstances, so I was really happy with their performance.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

Leading 17-16 against Army with two bouts remaining, the Harvard wrestling team sent its final two wrestlers to the mat.First up was sophomore James Fox in the 197-pound weight class. Fox took on Bryce Barnes and downed him, 10-5, to give the Crimson a four-point lead. Heavyweight David Ng was up next, and with the victory on the line, he posted a 7-4 decision over Curtis Garner.With Ng’s round done, Harvard (3-4, 1-3 EIWA) secured a 23-16 win over the Black Knights (5-6, 2-2) Sunday afternoon at Gillis Field House, its first EIWA victory.“I thought we wrestled very well as a team in an away match against a very tough team,” Fox said. “We always know that Army’s going to be a tough match. They train incredibly hard. It’s very, very hard to break an Army kid, as they like to say, they’re really top-notch, and they always come at you. It’s what they’re trained to do.”Freshman Jeffrey Ott began the Crimson’s bid for victory, competing against Hunter Wood in the 125-pound division. Ott finished his bout in dramatic fashion, pinning Wood down in 3:46 to launch Harvard into an early 6-0 lead.
Trying to break the 6-6 score after sophomore Ryan Osleeb lost his bout, the Crimson pitted co-captain Steven Keith, ranked 13th in the 141-pound category, against Army counterpart Tyler Rauenzahn. Keith scored four more bonus points with a major decision victory, shutting out Rauenzahn, 9-0, registering his 96th career victory.Rookie Todd Preston won his match in the 149-pound bout, giving Harvard a 13-6 lead. The victory was the freshman’s third on the season.“I thought Todd Preston wrestled a great match at 149,” coach Jay Weiss said. “He’s just starting to get into his own in his first semester, he’s really starting to wrestle well.”Co-captain Walter Peppelman, the eighth-ranked wrestler in his weight class, registered a major decision against Brian Harvey, giving the Crimson a commanding nine-point lead.“Walter also had a really tough match, and he was battling a couple of injuries,” Fox said. “He’s a really tough kid and got bonus points for us, while Steven Keith, who we expect big things from, was solid in his whole match, pulling off bonus points [as well]. Those little bonus points as the match goes on really helped us get the W’s tonight.”But back-to-back losses in the 174-pound and 184-pound classes by junior Cameron Croy and sophomore Josh Popple, respectively, brought the Black Knights within one again, setting the stage for Fox and Ng to bring home the win for the Crimson.“It was pretty close at the end, but we were able to get the W at the end,” Fox said. “Ng, our heavyweight, just did a great job at the end, coming back from behind and getting a big win to seal the deal.”Coming into the match, Harvard was looking to break a two-match losing streak but maintained confidence despite the record.“We were fully expecting to go in and win this match,” Fox said. “We knew this was a match we were fully capable of winning. Obviously, we knew they were going to be very tough, they don’t stop coming at you, they wrestle hard for seven minutes. So we had to wrestle solid, but we expected the win, we wrestled for the win and fortunately the results reflected that.”With six out of 10 victories, Fox felt that the team pulled off all of the goals put forth in practice in the previous week.“We have been very solid—all week, we focused on different positions, and we had specific goals going into the match,” Fox said. “Staying inside control, being tough on defense, certain breakdowns, good returns—we had these little goals that we wanted to wrestle in certain positions, and I think we did a good job of accomplishing those goals overall across the board, and those were the main reasons we were able to pull out the W today.”The Crimson is now off for two weeks before taking on Penn and Princeton, a break that Weiss is hoping to use to boost the team’s competition level.“I feel that we are going into a bit of an off-weekend, so I wanted to work on training pretty hard the last couple weeks,” Weiss said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how we compete, and that kind of dictates how we do from here on out. So I thought the guys responded, I thought they wrestled well. [Army] threw a lot of things at our game plan. I thought they stuck to it, and it worked.”—Staff writer Samantha Lin  can be reached at samanthalin@college.harvard.edu.

Harvard Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson filed an <a href=""http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DOMA-amicus-Article-3-brief-1-24-13.pdf"">amicus brief Thursday arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court does not have the constitutional power to rule on United States v. Windsor, the landmark case challenging the way marriage is defined in the Defense of Marriage Act.In the 40-page filing, Jackson argued that the justices do not have the jurisdiction to hear the case because President Barack Obama’s administration, which has stopped defending the controversial law, agrees with a lower court ruling deeming DOMA unconstitutional.Jackson’s brief also contends that the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, a Republican majority body in the House of Representatives, does not have legal standing to defend DOMA under Article III of the Constitution because Congress does not have the right to defend laws which do not specifically relate to its duties.According to the brief, “the interest here in assuring that [DOMA] is enforced is a generalized one” which falls under the domain of the executive branch, not that of Congress.At press time, Jackson could not be reached for comment on the brief.
The United States v. Windsor case addresses the constitutionality of section three of DOMA, which states that “the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.’”In particular, the justices are slated to rule on whether DOMA violates the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection component of the due process clause by excluding same-sex couples legally married in their own state.The Court <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/jackson-doma-brief-court/"">asked Jackson to write the brief shortly after it agreed to hear two cases addressing gay marriage, United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case challenging California’s Proposition 8.The Court will hear the oral arguments for Hollingsworth v. Perry on March 26 and United States v. Windsor on March 27. It is expected to issue decisions on both cases in June. If the justices take Jackson’s advice, however, they will likely not have time to rule on another DOMA case this year.Jackson, who has published extensively on constitutional law and the Supreme Court, joined the Law School faculty as a professor in 2011 after working at the Georgetown University Law Center. This semester, she is scheduled to teach “Comparative Constitutional Law” and a seminar called “Proportionality as a Transnational Principle,” according to the Law School course catalog.—Staff writer Dev A.

Last Friday The Crimson editorial board praised President Obama’s inauguration speech for his progressive stance on gay rights and climate change, while chiding him for his defense of Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. The Crimson worries that President Obama’s rhetoric will prevent the “serious” work of cutting entitlements.It’s a curious criticism. For the last four years, President Obama has been all too eager to cut Social Security and Medicare. Early in his presidency he <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/economy/28fiscal.html?emc=tnt&amp;tntemail0=y"">created a commission to investigate ways to reduce the debt including cuts to entitlement programs. As recently as December he <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/18/chained-cpi-social-security_n_2324907.html"">proposed a measure that would have changed the formula for calculating Social Security benefits, resulting in smaller checks for seniors. Without intense opposition from progressive advocacy groups and political stubbornness from House Republicans, President Obama would already have delivered cuts to Medicare and Social Security.But in his inauguration speech, the president shifted his position. For the first time, he <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/21/transcript-president-obama-2013-inaugural-address/"">explained the vital importance of our social welfare system: “Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security… strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.”President Obama took a big step forward by representing these programs as the cornerstone of our society instead of numbers on a budget line. It’s all too easy to point to numbers on charts and argue that cutting entitlement programs would reduce the debt. But such casual mathematics ignores the human cost of cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid.People who rely on Medicare are struggling to hold on until 65 as it is. West Virginia miners and South Carolina schoolteachers cannot afford to wait until 69 for Medicare. Cutting their Social Security check means forcing them to choose between prescription drugs or the electricity bill. And to cut Medicaid is to deprive impoverished children and families of the care they need. Cuts to these programs affect those who need it the most.
Americans believe in these programs. A <a href=""http://maristpoll.marist.edu/1211-slim-majority-thinks-debt-deal-will-be-reached/"">December 2012 Marist/McClatchy poll found 74 percent of voters and even 68 percent of Republicans oppose cuts to Medicare. 70 percent oppose Medicaid cuts. A <a href=""http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/557713/the-new-york-times-cbs-news-poll.pdf"">January New York Times/CBS poll found voters preferred cuts in military spending to cuts in Medicare and Social Security by more than two to one.Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all support our social welfare system because it works. Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid keep the elderly from using all their savings to pay for medical bills. They keep people from starving on the street.  Without these programs, 20 million people would be in poverty, <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3260"">according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Protecting the poor, the elderly, and the disabled expresses a belief in collective action. Life can be unpredictable and harsh, but no one should have to starve in a poorhouse. By supporting each other as a society, we can make our nation great.Advocates for reducing the deficit by cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid don’t believe that. Groups like Fix the Debt and the Peterson Foundation have spent decades hosting policy briefings, airing TV ads, and lobbying Congress to create fear about deficits. They have defined seriousness as a willingness to cut social welfare programs. If they were truly concerned about deficits, they would also advocate policies like raising taxes on the wealthy, cutting military spending, and ending corporate subsidies. The laser focus on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid reflects a belief that government should be favorable to the wealthy and corporations.Cutting our social welfare system is not serious or brave. It is an endorsement of government for the wealthy, who have no need for such programs. They fought tooth and nail against the creation of Social Security under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It took another 22 years of exhaustive legislative battles before Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare into law. The day it passed the Senate, Johnson <a href=""http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27072"">declared, “It is a great day for America.” Medicare, he said, “will bring the necessary satisfaction of having fulfilled the obligation of justice to those who have given a lifetime of service and labor to their country.”President Obama recognized that last Monday. If he wants to continue to make our country great, he will protect and expand the social welfare programs that make it so.Forrest S. Brown ’15 is a history concentrator in Leverett House.

Traveling halfway across the country for the ITA Kick-Off, the Harvard men’s tennis team split its matches on the weekend in Norman, Okla.All four teams participating—the Crimson, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and Memphis—were among the top 32 teams in the nation.“Our weekend was terrific,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “We came out a little bit banged up, which is not anything a coach gets wildly excited about, but we competed really hard and had some really good performances.”The No. 28 Crimson opened up against the No. 30 Fighting Irish (3-2), and rode consistent production in both singles and doubles to a 4-3 victory.But despite the close win against an evenly matched opponent, Harvard ended its weekend on a sour note, falling to No. 8 Oklahoma without taking a match.
“Overall, it was really good play, but [the Sooners were] just better,” Fish said. “They deserve to go to the national indoor team championships two weeks from now in Washington.”OKLAHOMA 4, HARVARD 0After taking down Notre Dame the day prior, Harvard  was easily beaten by Oklahoma, 4-0, Sunday afternoon.“This team was definitely a cut higher than [the Fighting Irish],” Fish said. “It was fun—I was watching our guys grow in front of my eyes. They were getting some balls that we weren’t used to seeing, and we would get beaten the first time, and then the second time we’d adjust.”The Sooners sealed their spot in the Round of 16 in the ITA Championships when Guillermo Alcorta posted a 6-4, 6-3 singles victory over sophomore Alex Steinroeder in the No. 2 match, giving Oklahoma the clinching fourth point to complete the shutout.Already down by one after a forfeit due to injury, the Crimson lost another singles point when freshman Kelvin Lam lost in two straight sets, 2-6, 0-6.“Kelvin played some tough people, so he was a little overmatched,” Fish said. “And [sophomore] Shaun Chaudhuri and Alex Steinroeder played one and two with [sophomore] Denis Nguyen out of the lineup, and they played great tennis.”Chaudhuri and freshmen Nicky Hu and Conor Haughey began their singles matches but neither finished once the Sooners gained their fourth points to seal their victory.In doubles play, the Oklahoma duo of Costin Paval and Dane Webb opened up the day with an 8-4 win over Chaudhuri and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster. Freshman Nicholas Mahlangu and Steinroeder also tasted defeat at the hands of Peerakit Siributwong and Leonard Stakhovsky, dropping the match, 8-5.HARVARD 4, NOTRE DAME 3

You've probably heard about most of these classes by now, but chances are you couldn't personally make it to each. Have no fear—we at Flyby made the rounds on this hectic first day of Shopping Week. We're here to give you details from some of Monday's most crowded lecture halls. So much for Pre-Term Planning!<!--more-->United States in the World 26: ""Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States""This Gen Ed may have had up to 200 students attend the first lecture, according to Caroline Light, who teaches the course and is also the director of studies for Women, Gender, and Sexuality.Many students could not fit into the classroom, and after class all 200 syllabi had been picked up, despite the fact that Pre-Term Planning data had indicated that around 140 were interested in the course, Light said. Light doesn't plan to lottery the course, so all interested students should be able to enroll.
History of Science 125: ""'Moneyball' Nation: Science and the Making of Modern America""Adam M. Butensky '13 is a pre-med student and club baseball player. He said his interests found their match with this course, which explores how mathematical models have been used to make decisions and evaluations—such as in baseball.Butensky was impressed by the first lecture, which he said had too many students to sit in chairs. He estimated that about 100 students had come to the first lecture of the course.Government 10: ""Foundations of Political Theory""Eric Beerbohm, Frederick S. Danziger Associate Professor of Government and of Social Studies, estimated that his introductory government class had about 120 attendees at the first lecture. Last spring, only 23 students took the course.Beerbohm, who has taught the course for four years now, will not be teaching it next spring, as he will be on sabbatical. He speculated that the high interest in the class Monday might be a result of students becoming more interested in political theory because of the current American political climate.English 170a: ""High and Low in Postwar America""English professor Louis Menand's course on fictional literature is new this year, and its debut was marked with a full classroom—and interested students spilling into the hallway. Pre-Term Planning data had suggested that about 35 students were interested in taking the course, Menand said, but over 100 showed up on Monday.

Five students will meet with the Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility this Friday to discuss the details of a social choice fund, the creation of which the University <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">announced in December.Three representatives from the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition—Michael E. Danto ’13, Nicole E. Granath ’15, and Samuel F. Wohns ’14—and the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council—Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Q. Zhu ’14—will attend the 45-minute meeting with two members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, who sit on the CCSR.Wohns, the alumni coordinator of Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, said that the meeting would help his group decide whether or not to give the approximately $11,000 in the Fair Harvard Fund to the Harvard-managed social choice fund. The Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition originally created the Fair Harvard Fund to show support for socially responsible investing, hoping that the University’s endowment managers at Harvard Management Company would take it over eventually.We’ll need to hear a credible commitment to the sustainability of the social choice fund,” Wohns said.Transparency, a promise to advertise the fund to potential donors, and oversight by students, alumni, and faculty would be important factors in the dicussion, according to Wohns.“We’re very optimistic that Friday’s meeting will lead to an agreement,” he said.
Harvard’s social choice fund, which the University announced after months of pressure from students and alumni, will be established in July and invested in one or more mutual funds that the CCSR deems socially responsible. Income from those investments will contribute to student financial aid.Yet to be decided are the particular mutual funds that will be employed and how transparent the fund’s investments will be.“We intend to explain to the CCSR that we think that the social fund is an incredibly important and historic first step on Harvard’s path towards becoming a leading socially responsible investor,” Wohns said.Wohns explained that many advocates of socially responsible investing were disappointed that Harvard had not chosen to put the entire endowment in so-called socially responsible investments, and said that he hoped the University would take additional steps in that direction.Raghuveer, who will represent the UC at the meeting, said that to her knowledge this type of meeting between the Corporation and students is “relatively unprecedented.”“I’m really excited that this meeting is happening,” Raghuveer said. “It’s a great step for activism on campus.”In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote that members of the CCSR and Office of Alumni Affairs and Development were looking forward to learning about students’ views on how the fund should operate and what its goals should be.Earlier on Friday, members of Students for a Just and Stable Future—an organization dedicated to finding solutions to the climate crisis—also will meet with the CCSR to advocate divestment from fossil fuels, according to the group’s communications coordinator Alli J. Welton ’15.Last November, a UC referendum advocating fossil fuel divestment <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/17/raghuveer-wins-uc-race/"">passed with 72 percent of the vote, but a week later, Galvin <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/25/univ-fossil-fuel-divsetment/"">told The Crimson that Harvard was “not considering divesting from companies related to fossil fuels.”—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Samuel Y.

A focus group of Undergraduate Council representatives released a <a href=""http://uc.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Harvard-Campus-Gun-Safety-Memo.pdf"">report early this month examining the University’s policies on guns, discussing the history of gun-related incidents on campus, and recommending policy actions to prevent campus shootings.“For the most part, we found that the [current] Harvard policies are good with regard to gun control,” UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said, “I think where Harvard falls short is that students don’t know what the policies are even though they’re publicized.”The focus group made five broad recommendations in the memo, ranging from banning firearms on all college campuses to mandating that universities regularly perform drills to prepare for emergencies.The report, which has not been put before the UC for endorsement, also referenced two recent gun-related incidents at Harvard—the 2010 suicide on the steps of Memorial Church and the 2009 shooting in Kirkland House.The document, along with other memos drafted by members of student governments at 15 colleges throughout the U.S., was sent to National Campus Leadership Council, an organization of more than 275 college student governments. The NCLC then compiled them into a <a href=""http://www.nationalcampusleaders.org/uploads/1/9/9/0/1990163/nclc_ovp_memo_on_gun_violence_prevention.pdf"">brief, which was submitted to Vice President Joe Biden’s office in advance of President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16 announcement on gun control measures.
“It was really great to see the Council so engaged in this topic even during winter break.” Raghuveer said.Sietse K. Goffard ’15, a UC representative for Currier House, said he volunteered to contribute to the memo because of his personal concern over gun violence in light of the recent shooting in Newtown, Conn.“I know we have a relatively safe campus, but the thought of [the shooting] happening on our campus or anywhere else was something that really sent shivers down my spine,” he said.Members of the focus group said that what surprised them most was the lack of clarity surrounding gun policies and prevention procedures at Harvard.Raghuveer said that although all students receive the University’s gun policy through A Guide to the First Year at Harvard and the Handbook for Students, a recent UC survey revealed that many students were unclear about the official policy of the College.Members of the focus group said that they were committed to working with the administration and other student groups to address the recommendations in the report, especially in improving student access to mental health resources.“Mental health is going to be a huge focus of the Undergraduate Council in the next year,” Raghuveer said.—Staff writer Steven S. Lee can be reached at stevenlee@college.harvard.edu

Despite all its pluses and perks, shopping period does present Harvard students with one potential problem: buyer's remorse. While students filing into course book mainstays like Ec10 and LS1b pretty much know what to expect from the semester, nothing screams caveat emptor quite like the words ""New Course"" (and the telltale lack of a Q score) next to a class name. But new courses aren't all bad. Sometimes, when we're lucky, they can even offer us a chance to snag a gem of a class before word gets out and the whole shebang is lotteried the following year. So, for those daring students who are eager to plunge into the great unknown (or who couldn't get into Maria Tatar's fairy tales class), here are five new courses that we at Flyby think you might want to check out.<!--more-->Culture and Belief 56: ""The Culture of Capitalism"" Occupy Wall Street is so last season. Rediscover what made capitalism cool (or at least culturally significant) in the first place with a look at works as diverse as those of Adam Smith, Benjamin Franklin, Charlie Chaplin, and Ayn Rand.

English 90ad: ""American Detective Fiction: Seminar"" Britain may have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and, alas, Benedict Cumberbatch), but America has the likes of Edgar Allan Poe, Raymond Chandler, and Chester Himes, whose works are all likely to be investigated in this course that seeks ""to develop an understanding of detective fiction"" and ""to explore the relationship between reading and investigating by considering how stories turn us into literary detectives."" History 79j: ""The Oldest Profession? A Global History of Sex Work, 1750-the Present"" If the title alone isn't enough to pique your interest, perhaps course subjects like patriotic prostitutes, sex tourism, and venereal diseases will.History of Science 125: ""'Moneyball' Nation: Science and the Making of Modern America"" If Brad Pitt's Moneyball was your favorite film of 2011, perhaps this will be your favorite course of 2013. By looking at the increasing popularity of both formal clinical trials and the ""Moneyball"" technique in baseball, this course makes math fun and explores ""how and why Americans have come to believe mathematics solves complicated problems, even in seemingly unrelated moral, political, and social domains."" Unfortunately, Jonah Hill does not TF.Societies of the World 49: ""The Worlds of Business in Modern China"" Everyone knows that everyone says the Chinese economy is taking over the world. Perhaps this class can help you prepare for it (and knock out a Gen Ed credit along the way) with topics that range from the age of tea and the opium trade to ""How Microsoft Conquered China."" Our sources tell us this one may be crowded.

Perhaps America's love affair with reality television—and schadenfreude—has reached a new low.Last month, the cable channel Oxygen came under fire for one of its shows in development. Titled ""All My Babies' Mamas,"" the show follows rapper Shawty Lo and his ten ""baby mamas,"" with whom he has a total of 11 children.<!--more-->Each of the baby mamas has a reductive nickname, such as Ecreia, who is referred to as ""The First Lady"" since she has control over Shawty's finances, and Liana, who gets called the ""Baby Mama from Hell"" since she's not super chill about sharing the father of her kids with nine other women.Shawty Lo, whose real name is Carlos Walker, offers the following explanation for how he came to father 11 kids out of wedlock: ""I had a lot of girls. They was in love and I probably was too with them, so you know, it just happened.""A website for the production company behind the show was hacked in December and <a href=""http://en.musicplayon.com/play?v=624278"">a 13-minute preview was leaked online. The video incited author Sabrina Lamb to start a petition against the show for its offensive representation of African-Americans. <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2263373/All-My-Babies-Mamas-Production-halted-reality-starring-rapper-Carlos-Shawty-Lo-Walker.html"">Over 37,000 signatures later, Oxygen announced they were canceling the show earlier this week.
Walker <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2013/01/19/shawty-lo-baby-mama-reality-show-cancelled-shopping-networks/"">told TMZ that he is determined to get the show on the air and that other networks are interested in the special. As for the allegations  that ""All My Babies' Mamas"" is demeaning to African-Americans, Walker says, ""I take pride in having been actively present in all my children's lives—and I understand my family doesn't represent the typical American family, but it's my family and it works for us.""But here's the problem with that defense: judging from the preview, ""All My Babies' Mamas"" doesn't represent Shawty Lo's life so much as openly smirk at it.The preview features choice moments such as Ashlin, Walker's latest 19-year-old girlfriend, and Ecreia fighting for the privilege of managing Walker's finances.  At another point, as Ashlin plays cards with a few of Walker's kids, an on-screen caption points to her that says, ""Ashlin, NOT one of the kids""—an inclusion that mocks both Ashlin's age and Walker's willingness to date her.The issue isn't whether ""All My Babies' Mamas"" is offensive—it is, to pretty much everyone. But this is what reality television has become. And if you draw the line at Shawty Lo, it's harder to defend shows such as ""The Biggest Loser,"" which now features child contestants, or ""Fat Girl Revenge,"" a show about formerly fat women who take revenge on people who made fun of them while they were fat. It's hard to expect reality television to be unoffensive when shock and schadenfreude are the entire point. The car-wreck appeal of reality TV is as strong as ever, and without a serious overhaul of the way we watch, shows like these are here to stay.

Among crowded classrooms and stacks of syllabi, professors outlining their collaboration policies have become a common theme of opening lectures.Before shopping period began on Monday, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris reminded faculty members that they are required to include an explanation of their collaboration policies on course syllabi, Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement.The start of the semester arrived less than a week after Harvard administrators <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/22/government-ad-board-announcement/"">announced that they had concluded their investigation of the Government 1310 cheating scandal and reached verdicts for the approximately 125 students involved.On Monday, students who shopped Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation” heard an explicit explanation of what was and was not acceptable collaboration. Assistant government professor Dustin Tingley said he followed the administration’s recommendation to detail his policy precisely on the syllabus and then briefly went over the protocol in class.“I certainly gave it front and center attention, and I think that’s attention it deserves, just so that there is clarity between faculty and students on the rules of the class,” Tingley said.
Adam M. Butensky ’13 said that students in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology 90: “Classic Experiments in Developmental Biology” had a discussion with professor Douglas A. Melton about collaboration during the first lecture.Butensky noted other classes he had shopped did not bring up their policies in lecture, even though all instructors were required to include it in their syllabi.For his class Linguistics 107: “Introduction to Indo-European,” professor Jay H. Jasanoff dedicated a paragraph of the syllabus to his policy, which states that students may collaborate on homework assignments but not on take-home exams.“[A collaboration policy is] obviously important, and it’s more important because there has been this cheating scandal,” said Jasanoff, who drew attention to his rules during the first lecture. “It’s good to spell it out explicitly.”Though Caroline Light, the professor of United States in the World 26: “Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States,” did not devote class time to explain her policy, she made her statement a prominent feature on the course’s iSite and syllabus. She also encouraged her students to spend time reading the policy.“Hopefully that will signal to students that I take these things very seriously,” Light said.Light’s policy describes the importance of students’ understanding the definition of plagiarism and encourages them to ask for help if they are ever in doubt of their citations.Tingley said the new emphasis on collaboration speaks to the dedication of professors to their students.“I think a lot of faculty really care about the best teaching practices, and I think this just highlights our commitment to that,” Tingley said.—Staff writer Madeline R. Conway can be reached at mconway@college.harvard.edu.

The Cambridge City Council continued to debate a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/6/20/cambridge-considers-soda-ban/"">ban on large sugar-sweetened beverages sold in the city at their meeting on Monday night. Councillors disagreed on the appropriate balance betweeen promoting public health and preserving indvidual freedoms.Councillors Marjorie C. Decker, Minka Y. vanBeuzekom, and Mayor Henrietta J. Davis endorsed the proposal to limit the size of sugar-sweetened beverages—including sodas—sold in the city, but the proposal was met with concern from Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72.Reeves said that he was conflicted about how to weigh Cantabrigians’ public health against his libertarian ideals.“I’m on both of those sides, so it will be interesting going forward,” Reeves said.In response, Decker said she believed that public health concerns must outweigh minor infractions on civil liberties. “The government imposes the number of seconds in which you can walk across the street,” she said in response to Reeves. “We as a society try to create norms that are healthy.”
Decker also noted that she had spoken with several leaders in the business community and only encountered one member who was concerned that the ban would affect profits. Davis said that there will be more consultations with the Cambridge business community before an official proposal is drafted.At the meeting, the Council also commemorated the end of the first phase of a two-year campaign against domestic violence. The meeting began with a ceremonial flourish as Decker, the chair of the Community Health Committee, recognized three organizations which had helped implement the first phase of the Council’s effort.During what they called “21 Days of Questions,” volunteers from the Cambridge Community Learning Center, the Community Engagement Team, and Transition House—a shelter for battered women—stopped people on the street and asked them to jot down questions they had about domestic violence.“This is just the beginning,” Decker said. The organizations plan to follow “21 Days of Questions” with “365 Days of Actions,” a year-long phase in which they will disseminate key questions back to the public via the web and the media.The goal of the campaign is to engage the Cambridge community in raising awareness for issues of domestic violence.Finally, all eight councillors in attendance approved the landmark designation for the St. Francis of Assisi Church, the third-oldest church in the city. They also unanimously agreed to strike down the zoning provision stating that any cafeteria on the ground floor of a commercial space must be opened to the public at least 20 hours a week. With this decision, the Council allowed biotechnology company Biogen Idec to open a café exclusively for its employees in its new Kendall Square building.—Staff writer Sonali Y.

Support for entitlement programs does not necessarily entail ignorance of fiscal responsibility. In an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/25/harvard-inauguration/"">editorial this past Friday, the Crimson Staff declared their “disappoint[ment] with the president’s wholesale commitment to entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.” Evidently, this “wholesale commitment” evidenced how the president was “conveniently ignor[ing]” the country’s economic difficulties and impending fiscal cliff. But the Obama administration’s commitment to sustainable entitlement reform in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has already set in motion a roadmap for the leading driver of entitlement costs to steadily decrease.The New York Times’ Nate R. Silver recently performed a detailed <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/what-is-driving-growth-in-government-spending/"">breakdown of the major contributors to federal and local government spending and noticed that “all of the major categories of government spending have been increasing relative to inflation. But essentially all of the increase in spending relative to economic growth…has come from entitlement programs, and about half of that has come from health care entitlements specifically.”Although healthcare entitlement costs are rising, their rise is slowing. Economist Peter R. Orszag, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/slower-growth-in-health-costs-saves-u-s-billions.html"">commented last year on how the United States is experiencing “a very marked slowdown in the growth of health-care costs.” In his article, Orszag cites the projections of two Harvard economics professors, David M. Cutler and Jeffrey B. Liebman. Their data shows that “relative to the projections issued three years earlier, today’s forecasts suggest health savings of $3,500 per family of four by 2017.” This is because “health-system leaders are anticipating two significant shifts over the next eight years: away from fee-for-service payments and toward clinical-decision support.”The Affordable Care Act bolstered these shifts. Instead of simply shifting costs to individuals, the ACA provided a starting point for the government to regulate the relationship between health payments and the quality of care. A <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb1205901"">study in the New England Journal of Medicine notes that the ACA will “significantly reduce Medicare spending over the next decade.” However, the ACA only scratched the surface. If we really want to take control of entitlement spending, we should expand on the ACA’s provisions for quality control to make them concretely enforced throughout the entire private healthcare system.For example, the ACA set certain administrative rules for Medicare, including requirements for the digitization and standardization of health records. By requiring private health payers and providers to simplify their administrative systems as well, the government can reduce up to 14 percent of excessive healthcare spending. The NEJM study observes that having “a task force consisting of payers, providers, and vendors set binding compliance targets, monitor use rates, and have broad authority to implement additional measures” could “achieve system-wide savings of $30 billion a year.”
The Obama administration has already put the government on track to control the leading driver of entitlement spending—and it can be controlled further, if Congress cooperates. But Silver’s analysis also reveals that the deficit problem has other causes. Defense programs are second only to entitlements in spurring federal spending growth.Former Congressman Barney Frank <a href=""http://www.democracyjournal.org/27/the-new-mandate-on-defense.php?page=all"">explored this phenomenon recently, discussing how he “[has] been greatly frustrated…by the extent to which establishment opinion focuses on ‘entitlements’…as a major cause of the deficit” and how this “ignores the extremely large contribution made to this problem by military expenditures that are far beyond any rational assessment of our national security.”In particular, Frank points out the United States’ excessive defensive support for many European and Asian allies as well as the continuing balance-sheet burden caused by nation-building in Afghanistan. He determines that our security interests can be protected while slowly phasing in cuts that would decrease defense spending to 20 percent below the current year’s amount. Even if only half of his proposed cuts are feasible, they could play a major role in reducing the deficit.Last Friday’s Crimson editorial oversimplified the issues involved in the deficit reduction debate, answering the question of fiscal responsibility with an ambiguous desire to reform entitlement programs. The Obama administration has already played a vast role in resolving those questions by sustainably modernizing healthcare entitlements. The Affordable Care Act has helped decrease healthcare costs, which are the leading driver of entitlement spending. By innovating further, the government can ensure this trend continues in the private sector. And if politicians dare to look outside of entitlements, the government can be even more effective in controlling costs.Nikhil R.

Harvard University President Drew G. Faust attended the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week, sharing her thoughts on the future of higher education and women in economic leadership with high-profile leaders and thinkers from around the world.During what Harvard’s Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Christine M. Heenan called “three very tightly packed days,” Faust sat on two panels and met with University alumni.Faust, who is the first woman to serve as president of Harvard, used her time during the discussion “Women in Economic Decision-Making” primarily to reflect on how she has come to perceive her role as the University’s first female leader.“I don’t want to serve with an asterisk next to my name, as if I got a special identity or special category,” she said. “Instead, I wanted to be the president of Harvard who happened also to be a woman.”Faust said that after being appointed University president, she received letters from women around the world inspired by her accomplishments. This attention, she said, led her to think about how to use her platform at Harvard to bolster the education of women worldwide.
When Faust travels, she said she makes a point to “always go to girls’ schools and meet with young women and talk to them about their aspirations.”The “Women in Economic Decision-Making” panel also included other prominent women from around the world, including Christine M. O. Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, the chief operating officer of Facebook. This was the second consecutive year that the WEF has held a plenary session focused on women.The second panel in which Faust participated was a discussion on the future of higher education.In one of several media interviews given by Faust in Davos, she told Indian broadcasting network New Delhi Television that education was an important topic for the conference because of its connection to economic success.“I think education has enormous prominence in the minds of people here at Davos and in the minds of leaders around the world, because knowledge is the currency of the 21st century,” she said.While abroad, Faust also co-hosted a reception for Harvard alumni with Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 and attended meetings with the Global University Leaders Forum, a network of the WEF that includes academic leaders from around the world.Last week marked the fourth time that Faust has taken part in the conference, which she also attended in 2008, 2010, and 2012.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Samuel Y.

With co-captain Christian Webster impersonating Reggie Miller and freshman guard Siyani Chambers making acrobatic layups, there’s understandable euphoria surrounding the Crimson’s athletic backcourt. Chambers, Webster and sophomore Wesley Saunders—a six-foot five athletic combo guard—notched 54 of the Crimson’s 82 points in Saturday’s contest against Dartmouth. Junior sharpshooter Laurent Rivard, another six-foot five wing who plays behind the arc, is a tremendous shooter who adds to the potency of the group.The Crimson are second in the nation overall in three-point shooting percentage and play a Gregg Popovich-type offense with shooters everywhere. This forces defenders to come out on shooters, allowing Saunders and Chambers to use their length and speed to get past defenders to the hoop. If the defense crashes on the driving man, he can swing a pass to one of the team’s four combo guards, each shooting over 36 percent from three. If the defender doesn’t leave his man, that leaves Saunders or Chambers against a big, a matchup coach Tommy Amaker would take any day. However, Saturday’s most important players may have been lost in the shuffle. Sophomore forwards Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi quietly made the comeback possible. While the quartet of guards each average more than 30 minutes a game, Moundou-Missi and Travis form a platoon at center. On Saturday, they combined for 21 points, 12 rebounds, two steals, and only two missed shots on 12 attempts. To put this in perspective, Travis scored one less point on nine 2-pointers than the rest of the team did on its combined three-point tries (5 for 21 on the day). 
Of course, without Chambers’ play or Webster’s clutch threes we’d be wondering why Harvard has a 1-1 record against the league’s worst team of 2011. But the same could be said of Travis’s 10 first-half points or Moundou-Missi’s and-one with 90 seconds left in overtime.  The sophomore big men kept the game close despite the Crimson’s absymal shooting numbers (one shot made in 10 attempts outside the paint). Moundou-Missi and Travis provide even more on defense: size. Saunders, Webster, and Chambers are all quick and lengthy on-ball defenders that allow the Crimson to pressure opposing guards into turnovers, but this trio puts the team at a height disadvantage. When Rivard plays alongside those three, that leaves the Crimson on-court squad with only one player listed above six-five. Thus, it’s imperative that the team protects the bucket inside. In years past, Kyle Casey and Keith Wright anchored the middle for the Crimson; this year, the onus falls on Travis and Moundou-Missi to protect the paint.Although undersized for their positions, the sophomore big men fight hard and were key Saturday in deterring guards from charging into the paint. Sure, the Dartmouth guards recorded 29 points, but let’s look inside these numbers. They needed a combined 25 shots and 11 free throws to get there—not terribly efficient. The opposing trio also combined for two made layups all game, evidence of a good job protecting the paint. Furthermore, six of the 29 points came on threes and six more on end-of-game free throws, shots that Travis and Moundou-Missi can’t affect. In addition to anchoring the defense, Travis and Moundou-Missi fulfill another job for the Crimson. In the Crimson’s offense, the bigs need to be mobile when the team gets out and running. Both players use their quickness to outmaneuver larger, slower bigs (see Travis’ 19 points and five steals against a big St. Mary’s frontcourt or 14 points and two steals against Boston College). Harvard is at its best when the big men get out on quick outlets and allow Chambers to get running Chambers has received plenty of well-deserved praise in the absence of departed senior Brandyn Curry.  This is not totally unexpected, though, as the freshman is a former Minnesota Mr. Basketball.  On the other hand, finding replacements for Keith Wright and Kyle Casey has been a pleasant surprise. The duo of Moundou-Missi and Travis has flourished this year, combining for 16.1 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 2 steals per game. Their impact was felt in a big way Saturday, and for the Crimson to achieve their postseason goals, it will need to be once again. —Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Today 180 million people around the globe are infected with Hepatitis C. In the United States, 3.2 million <a href=""http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/hepc/stats.htm"">are infected with the virus—1.6 percent of the American population. Compare this to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS today, and you will see that the difference is colossal: 34 million people <a href=""http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm"">are infected with HIV/AIDS globally and 1.2 million people domestically. More people are dying today of Hepatitis C than of HIV/AIDS, a fact that is widely unknown.While the numbers for HIV/AIDS are still high, they have dropped dramatically since the 1980s and ’90s. Due to an uprising of powerful activists groups and community advocacy, HIV/AIDS was brought to the forefront of political and social issues. Meanwhile, Hepatitis C is on the opposite side of the spectrum. It has lacked a community of concerned individuals and has consequently had very little attention since 1989, when it was first discovered. Advocacy for Hepatitis C is practically dismal, especially compared to HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis B. Funding for Hepatitis C research and resources is virtually negligible. This is due to the fact that Hepatitis C is not only an unspoken topic, but it is also an incredibly complex topic.Hepatitis C is a slow-progressing, sometimes deadly blood-borne virus that attacks the liver. Of all people with the Hepatitis C virus, up to 85 percent <a href=""http://www.natap.org/2011/newsUpdates/060611_04.htm"">will develop chronic hepatitis. Of this 85 percent, 70 percent will develop chronic liver disease, nearly 20 percent will develop cirrhosis, an incurable disease that results in scarring of the liver, and up to five percent will die of cirrhosis or liver cancer.What many people are not aware of is that there is now a <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepc-guide/hepatitis-c-treatment-overview"">cure for Hepatitis C. A person with Hepatitis C can be free of the virus within 24 weeks if he or she follows a prescribed treatment plan. However, the virus is asymptomatic, which means that people who are infected are not aware of their status unless they are tested—and Hepatitis C testing is not a commonplace or encouraged procedure among medical institutions. The virus is also most commonly transmitted through injection drugs, contributing to the fact that Hepatitis C is <a href=""http://www.natap.org/2011/newsUpdates/060611_04.htm"">most prevalent among poor, urban, and marginalized populations (especially <a href=""http://caps.ucsf.edu/factsheets/injection-drug-users-idus-2/"">drug users), many of whom are incapable of or not receptive to seeking out treatment.This is for reasons such as a lack of motivation, a lack of peer, social, and community support, failure to recognize the long-lasting impact of not seeking treatment, lack of education about the illness, the attached stigmatization of infection, and an under-recognition of the condition (especially due to <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/hepc-guide/hepatitis-c-treatment-overview"">the fact that one could live 20 years without experiencing any symptoms). In addition, retention rates for those who actually seek treatment are incredibly low because the side effects are highly physically, financially, and emotionally debilitating.
Research has found that Hepatitis C is also most prevalent among the baby-boomer generation, the generation that lived through the “Summer of Love,” when experimentation with Schedule I drugs was especially high. Today, individuals who lived during that era have an <a href=""http://www.heart-intl.net/HEART/040111/HepatitisC-An.pdf"">HCV prevalence rate of more than double the national average. Targeting this generation is our best bet at drastically dampening the epidemic.However, the “hippie” generation should not be our only focus. New statistics have shown that Hepatitis C is on the rise among American youth. In Massachusetts alone, <a href=""http://www.aac.org/media/blog/world-hepatitis-day-july-28-2012.html"">HCV prevalence has risen from 65 cases per 100,000 between the ages of 15 and 24 in 2002 to 113 cases per 100,000 in 2009. This has been caused by to an increase in injection drug usage among America’s youth.What the fight against Hepatitis C needs is both attention and money, and a lot of it. Specifically, it needs funding for programs such as the Division for Viral Hepatitis of the Centers for Disease Control, needle exchange sites, surveillance programs that value both casework and harm-reduction approaches, Hepatitis C education in communities and secondary schools, research funding for the development of a Hepatitis C vaccination, and more. But these needs cannot be met, let alone be requested, until our communities are educated and aware of the gravity and urgency of this issue. The time to act is now.India Perez-Urbano ’16 lives in Canaday Hall.

After a long and relaxing winter break spent swimming by the beaches of my native Florida, I returned to campus a few days early to take a lifeguard certification course. And so about a week ago, early in the morning, I found myself bundled up in just about every shirt I own and ready to trek over to Blodgett Pool. As the wind licked at my arms and the frost nipped at my heels, I walked and walked and discovered that the pool must actually be located on the Connecticut side of the state line.I also discovered that the time has come for me to buy some long-sleeve shirts. Regardless of how many are worn, t-shirts are simply not quite warm enough for the winter.Mildly frostbitten, I finally arrived at the pool and changed into my bathing suit. The other lifeguard trainees and I were greeted by our instructor, who cut right to the chase. He said the first thing we’ll practice is our jumps. After that, we’ll do rescues, and then underwater knife fighting. He mentioned the last bit is not Red Cross material, but that it can be just as important, depending on the situation.I glanced around at the other students, all of us not yet wet behind the ears, and they were looking around too, waiting for someone to laugh first. No one did. Our instructor, we figured out, was completely serious. And although he declined to be more specific on the details of underwater knife fighting, he assured us that such skills come in handy unexpectedly. He also assured us that knife practice would be useful fending off sharks and that he has relied on knives many times during his swims and tours of duty.We never did learn to knife fight underwater. Next Wintersession, I am told.
Now you may be wondering what the point of this lengthy introduction could possibly be. After all, I have no idea when in my suburban lifetime I will ever need to know how to fight with a knife underwater. But then it dawned on me that I took a class last year on presidential elections, and there is a greater chance of me knife fighting in the Atlantic than running a presidential campaign. (I know this, you see, because I took a statistics course.)I took the elections class because I could; I wanted to learn more about presidential politics and had the opportunity to do so. I took a cooking course, too, despite the fact that the administration did not allow me to count it toward my economics concentration. The amount of time it takes to cook an egg, I was told, did not affect my fundamental understanding of supply and demand. Nevertheless, my Freshman Seminar on U.S. elections and the Science of Cooking were two of the most rewarding classes I have taken.This week, classes start up again, and there are plenty of required courses that need to be taken between now and graduation. We all have our concentrations and secondary fields and citations to take care of. But there are also those coveted free slots, those elective opportunities to take classes on neo-Babylonian inscriptions or Buddhism in Japan or the history of rap or just about anything else. For most of us, knowledge about Babylon has little post-college application or career relevance. Yet the classes that promise nothing more than an interesting semester usually turn out to be the best ones. When else will you have the opportunity to learn about electronic dance music in an academic setting?Sure, I spent some of my winter break learning how to lifeguard. My fellow students and I learned how to pull victims out of the water, how to perform CPR, and how to prevent fires in the pool. Alas, we never made it to the knife fighting part of the curriculum. Next year, though, when the time comes to sign up for Wintersession activities, the first one I’ll look for is underwater knife fighting. Because if not then, when?Unfortunately, I can’t learn about ancient Babylon this semester. I have some concentration requirements to take care of.Jacob R.

Amid doomsday prophesies about their imminent extinction, public universities have shown surprising initiative and business savvy in staying afloat by joining the popular new trend in online education. A number of public universities across the country, including Arizona State University, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Arkansas, are <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/education/public-universities-to-offer-free-online-classes-for-credit.html?ref=education&amp;_r=1&amp;&amp;gwh=5700C051E5DD134D863420E68EAD3BEF"">planning on converting certain introductory courses into massive open online courses, meaning they will be free to anyone anywhere in the world with an internet connection. Until recently, the development of online education platforms has been mainly the domain of elite private institutions such as Harvard, which <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/2/mit-edx-virtual-online/"">partnered with MIT last May to launch the free online education platform edX, offering participants a taste of a premier education without the official degree. The new MOOC2Degree program currently being pioneered by public universities goes one step further by encouraging participants to register for full, paid degrees after completing the free introductory courses.Unlike Harvard, whose experiment in online education has been characterized by rhetoric of educational accessibility, the introduction MOOC courses seems to be driven at least in part by a need for new sources of revenue. Free introductory courses are advantageous for universities because they are prime bait for enrollment MOOC2Degree programs, which are the universities’ real focus. Yet even if the goals of Harvard’s edX and the MOOC2Degree program are not entirely aligned, impact of the two programs is effectively the same: Free education is made available to students who could not access it before. MOOC2Degree also has the added benefit of allowing students to preview a field for free before pursuing additional coursework, and it seems to be doing so with resounding success: Between 72 and 84 percent of students who successfully complete the introductory courses reportedly go on to take additional coursework. For these reasons, MOOC courses and the MOOC2Degree program should be regarded as a uniformly positive development in digital education.While online education can never replace the full educational experience of a degree earned on a college campus, any initiative that opens educational opportunities to more people is necessarily a commendable one. And if the MOOC2Degree program becomes a source of significant revenue for financially strapped universities, this is all the more reason to applaud its success.Of course, one might fear that there is the risk of these free introductory courses providing false advertisement for a degree program that is comparatively worse, conferring a meaningless diploma for a fee. Indeed, universities connected with for-profit companies notoriously have low graduation rates, low employment rates, and high student debt rates. But simply packaging already extant online programs into the MOOC2Degree is unlikely to do any harm. Credit will only be awarded to those who complete the program successfully, while those who fail to do so will not lose any money on introductory courses. We must applaud any sensible business strategy that helps universities and students alike.A current complaint of many online students is the lack of accreditation they receive for completing online courses, even those offered by prestigious universities like Stanford and Harvard, whose online courses are not certified with degrees. With the MOOC2Degree program, public universities are forging an additional and much-needed pathway to achievement for the underserved students for whom they were originally created.

The Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs announced Tuesday that Gary S. Samore, White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism under President Barack Obama, has been tapped to lead the center as its executive director.“Gary Samore is an outstanding choice for the Belfer Center executive director position,” said Samore’s predecessor, Army Brigadier General Kevin Ryan. “He has exceptional academic credentials and experience in leading research institutions and of course he is a distinguished alumnus of the Belfer Center.”Samore worked briefly at the Belfer Center after graduating with a Ph.D. in government from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1984. Since then, he has held a variety of research and governmental posts and has worked for both the Clinton and Obama administrations.“Gary Samore is the very model of a Belfer Center professional,” Center Director Graham T. Allison ’62 said in a press release. “We count ourselves fortunate that one of the nation’s leaders in both thought and action on the core issues of the Center’s agenda will bring his rich experience to our community.”In the Obama White House, Samore advised the president on matters concerning arms control, WMD proliferation, and terrorism.  His position under President Obama came after he played a key role in negotiating the end of North Korea’s nuclear program as President Bill Clinton’s Special Assistant and Senior Director for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls at the National Security Council.
Samore continued his negotiation efforts under President Obama, helping to contract the New START arms control agreement with Russia. His Obama-era resume also includes efforts to battle terrorism and quash Iranian nuclear ambitions.When he arrives in Cambridge, Samore’s obligations will be more academic in nature. Along with co-chairing the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Working Group and managing and advising the Belfer Center’s research plans, he will also conduct his own research.After Samore assumes his position, Ryan will preside over new programs on defense and intelligence at the Belfer Center. Ryan expressed optimism about the prospect of Samore’s return.“We’re excited to have him back,” Ryan said.—Staff writer Steven R. Watros can be reached at watros@college.harvard.edu.

Donald F. Hornig ’40 advised presidents, led Brown University through turbulent years of protest, and helped to design and then detonate the first atomic bomb. But his former colleagues at Harvard remember him as someone who helped to form generations of scientists and fostered a spirit of collaboration.“Some professors have huge egos, and they really want to be remembered for the discoveries they made,” Harvard School of Public Health professor Joseph D. Brain said. “But I think Don was really unusual—perhaps because he’d already accomplished so much [and] that he came without ego and without agenda.”Hornig died Jan. 21 at a nursing home in Providence, R.I. He was 92 years old.Hornig was only in his twenties and a newly-minted Ph.D. in chemistry when his boss at the Underwater Explosives Laboratory at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute offered him an invitation to join a team of scientists working on a top-secret government project.Upon his acceptance, Hornig unknowingly walked into the history books. The team was based at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the project was the now-famed Manhattan Project, where Hornig designed the explosive lens used to detonate the first atomic bomb in the summer of 1945. He was the last team member to inspect the bomb before pulling the trigger.
Until his death, Hornig maintained that the bomb had saved lives.After the project disbanded, Hornig began a more traditional career in academia, teaching at Princeton and then at Brown. But his academic ambitions were derailed in 1963 when his Harvard classmate President John F. Kennedy ’40 asked him to serve as presidential science adviser. Hornig stayed in the post until 1969.Hornig was in the midst of completing a six-year term on the Harvard Board of Overseers in 1970 when Brown University asked him to be its next president. His six year tenure from 1970 to 1976 was marked by much controversy, including student protests over the Vietnam War and university budget cuts.Shortly after resigning at Brown, Hornig returned to Harvard as a professor and adviser, and later served as chair of the Department of Environmental Health and Physiology from 1988 to 1990.After more than a half-decade of scrutiny at Brown, Harvard was a relief for Hornig, Brain said. Hornig was able to think creatively and collaboratively, and ultimately founded the Interdisciplinary Programs in Health, bringing the top minds in science to work on interdisciplinary public and environmental health issues.“It was very telling to me that he came back to the School of Public Health and really saw public health and environmental health as a place where he really wanted to leave his mark as he approached the end of his career after all the opportunities and experiences he had,” said Douglas W. Dockery, chair of the Department of Environmental Health and Physiology at HSPH.Hornig was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships. He was also one of the youngest members ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences.Hornig is survived by his wife Lilli, a Harvard-trained chemist and also a member of the Los Alamos team. After working to develop the bomb, she became a member of the Brown faculty and championed women’s rights.—Staff writer Nicholas P. Fandos can be reached at nicholasfandos@college.harvard.edu.

Congressman Stephen F. Lynch, who has represented the South Boston area since winning office in a 2001 special election, will launch a campaign for the Senate seat vacated Tuesday by new Secretary of State John F.

The location is fitting for Lynch, a former president of the Local 7 and a candidate who will rely on his ties to organized labor.Although Congressman Edward J. Markey, of the Fifth District, has polled better than Lynch and has earned many important endorsements, including those of Kerry and Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Lynch's relationship with labor has the potential to be game changing. Steven Tolman, the president of the influential AFL-CIO union, estimated to the Globe last week that Lynch already has the support of about half of the union’s members. According to Tolman, A candidate wins the AFL-CIO endorsement if he or she has the support of two-thirds of the membership.While the union has not yet decided if it will endorse a Democrat in the primary, which is set to occur six weeks before the June 25 special election, it is certain that Lynch would be the favorite for the nod. ""He has an awful lot of long-term commitments and friendships in labor,"" Tolman told the Globe. ""We grew up with him.""Still, it may be an uphill battle for Lynch, whose conservative positions on social issues differentiate him not only from Markey, but also from many Massachusetts liberal democrats.
A member of the House Financial Services committee, Lynch is a graduate of the Wentworth Institute of Technology, the Boston College Law School, and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino will announce a proposal to bring edX—the rapidly growing online education venture started by Harvard and MIT last spring—to the Boston community, according to a draft of his State of the City address, which he is slated to deliver on Tuesday night. Envisioned as BostonX, the initiative will be launched first in neighborhood community centers and will then expand to high school classrooms and public libraries, the Boston Globe first reported early Tuesday morning. Part of the plan includes expanding the program, currently structured around online courses for individuals, to facilitate a community-based group learning experience.BostonX locations will host virtual and in-person meetings with affiliated university or community college faculty, staff, and graduate students. They will also provide training on how to use the edX system, career counseling, and job transitioning programs.
 EdX already has a large presence in the Greater Boston area. Since being launched by Harvard and MIT, the program has expanded to include courses from Wellesley College. Bunker Hill Community College and MassBay Community College have also partnered with edX to use its educational materials.—Staff writer Amna H.

UPDATED: January 30, 2013, at 2:30 a.m.The National Football League Players Association has issued Harvard Medical School a $100 million grant to establish a 10-year research initiative aimed at finding solutions to players’ health problems.“We are excited about the contributions this extraordinary partnership will make to NFL players, the community, and the knowledge base of medicine,” Ross D. Zafonte, head of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the Medical School, said in a statement.Zafonte and Lee M. Nadler, dean for clinical and translational research at the Medical School, will lead the initiative, entitled Harvard Integrated Program to Protect and Improve the Health of NFLPA Members.More than one dozen lawsuits have been filed by former NFL players against the league, claiming that the NFL withheld information about the potential negative health consequences of playing in the league.
These lawsuits—in addition to the multiple widely publicized suicides of former and active NFL players—have drawn unprecedented public attention to the possible long-term health repercussions of playing in the NFL. These can include brain damage, heart problems, and diabetes, according to the program’s overview.Alvaro Pascual-Leone, professor of neurology and associate director of the initiative, said that NFL players face physical and public stresses that call for focused research on their health.“At the end of the day, you have unique individuals going through a very unique life,” he said.Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier said in a statement that the expansive program announced Tuesday will enlist a variety of doctors and scientists from the Medical School, Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and other schools across the University.“We are committed to going beyond our walls,” he said. “We will reach out to other institutions when necessary in order to access the resources needed to solve the most pressing medical issues identified by the NFLPA.”Central to the initiative is a study of 1,000 retired football players that will produce a “biological profile of illness” for each player. Scientists will use the results of that unprecedented project to design methods to prevent and diagnose health problems. The researchers will also seek to design new methods of treating concussion-related brain damage, develop a technique to regrow ACL tissue, and produce more comprehensive images of heart function.According to William P. Meehan ’58, director of the Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention and associate director of the initiative, some parts of the project are ready to be launched immediately while others will require more development before being implemented.“This is a long-term commitment,” he said. “A gargantuan task.”—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Samuel Y.

UPDATED: January 30, 2013, at 3:10 a.m.Yet another election season is poised to begin in the Commonwealth Wednesday as Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 is expected to appoint an interim Senator to replace John F. Kerry, who resigned from his post Tuesday after easily winning Senate confirmation to become the next Secretary of State.While multiple individuals, including former Patrick chief of staff William Cowan and Victoria R. Kennedy, the wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, have been rumored as front runners for the appointment, Patrick has gone out of his way to suggest that he will appoint either a woman or a person of color to the post. Former Congressman Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62 also has <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/5/barney-frank-interim-senator/"">expressed interest in the post.As in 2010, when he appointed Paul G. Kirk, Jr. ’60 to the seat vacated after the death of Senator Kennedy on the condition that Kirk not run in the special election, Patrick has said that he is looking for a “wise steward of the interest of the people of the Commonwealth while we wait for the people to elect a Senator.”With the April 30 primaries preceding the approaching June 25 special election, two Democrats are gearing up for the race. In December, Fifth Congressional Representative Edward J. Markey, who has served in Congress since 1976, threw his hat <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/27/markey-special-senate-kerry/"">into the ring. And Eighth District Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School who has served the South Boston area on Capitol Hill since 2001, is expected to declare his candidacy on Thursday, the Boston Globe <a href=""http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2013/01/29/rep-stephen-lynch-reserves-hall-for-announcement-set-run/IliYsqG0qFJEmvkNCzas9N/story.html"">reported on Tuesday.
Markey has emerged as the frontrunner after racking up endorsements from many influential Massachusetts Democrats, including Kerry and Victoria R. Kennedy. Still, Lynch’s connections to labor are a potential game changer. A former president of the Iron Workers Local 7 union, he is considered the favorite to earn the endorsement of the AFL-CIO if it chooses to endorse a candidate in the primary.“[Lynch] has an awful lot of long-term commitments and friendships in labor,” Mass. AFL-CIO president Steven A. Tolman told the Globe. “We grew up with him.”On the Republican side, former Senator Scott Brown, who lost his seat last November to Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, has long been expected to run, but has not yet announced a decision. While many politically connected experts expect Brown to declare his candidacy after Patrick announces his appointment, others are less sure.“If he was inclined to run I think that would be clear right now, but there haven’t been any signals,” said Republican strategist Todd Domke. “And that’s definitely discouraging to Republicans.”Strategists have said that if Brown were to decide not to run, it would almost certainly be in an effort to extend his political shelf life.“I think this is a case where he realizes that if he runs now and loses, that really his career is probably over,” said Joseph D. Malone ’78, a former Massachusetts treasurer and one-time Republican congressional candidate. “He might be deciding between running now, when the Republican label on a federal level is hurting him, or running later, when he can look at corruption in the State House and run against that.”If Brown decides against entering the special election, former Governor William F. Weld ’66 would be a likely GOP candidate. Weld, who hinted that he would like to see Brown replace Kerry, has extensive experience in Massachusetts politics. In addition to serving as governor for six years, he ran for Senate in 1996 and has remained influential in state Republican politics.“[Weld] is still pretty popular and has run for Senate before,” Domke told the Boston Globe this weekend. “With his quirky sense of humor, candor, and unpredictability, he’d be a fun candidate.”The history of Senate special elections in Massachusetts is both rich and brief. Until 2004, the governor held the power to appoint a senator to serve out the remainder of a vacated term. That year, at the urging of Senator Edward Kennedy, the Massachusetts State Legislature changed the law so that Republican Governor Mitt Romney would not be able to appoint a Republican senator in the event that Kerry was elected president.—Staff writer Matthew Q.

With less than two minutes to go in regulation, it was safe to say that Christian Webster was not having the game of his life.The senior guard was a lackluster one for six from long range that afternoon, and the Crimson had found itself facing a double-digit deficit against Dartmouth, a squad that Harvard had a much easier time handling just two weeks ago in a 75-65 victory.But the tide turned just when it seemed that all hope was lost. Down by 10, Webster rolled off a series off three long-range buckets in the final minutes of regulation to spur a late comeback victory for the Crimson. “I haven’t been a part of something like that since the Brown game a couple of years ago,” the co-captain said, referencing Harvard’s comeback from a 22-point halftime deficit in the 2010-2011 season. “It was just ridiculous. I’m at a loss for words.”The Crimson had trailed Dartmouth for all but the first minute of play, as the team quickly found itself down 12-4.
“They were playing their best ball for every facet of the game,” Webster said. “They were beating us on the backboard, their big guys were driving, getting easy shots [off]. Our shots weren’t falling, obviously. We were just missing shots, and they were making shots.”A poor shooting performance from some of its key players left Harvard down 29-20 at the end of the first half. The start of the second seemed no different, as the Crimson failed to keep pace with its opponent and fell behind by as many as 13.Webster himself came up empty-handed for most of regulation. An early three-point jumper followed by a free throw in the eighth minute of play were Webster’s only points of the contest, and he was scoreless the rest of the game heading into the final minutes of play. When the team needed its captain most, Webster stepped up. Since being named co-captain earlier this season, the senior has proven integral to the Crimson’s success thus far. Webster has been as much a leader on the court as he has been off it, averaging  32 minutes of playing time and over eight points per contest.This occasion was no different, as the Crimson saw its co-captain step up and lead the comeback charge. Following a turnover and a Dartmouth timeout, Webster hit his first trey off an assist by freshman Siyani Chambers, cutting the Crimson’s deficit to seven with 1:33 to go.“Like a lot of shooters and scorers, if they make one, all of the sudden they’re calm, they’re confident,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s exactly what happened.”But despite two free throws by Laurent Rivard and a layup by Chambers, the Crimson still sat six points down with 0:47 to go. Webster stepped up again and hit another three-point jumper off an assist by sophomore Wesley Saunders with 0:41 left, bringing Harvard within a single possession of tying the game. A pair of Big Green free throws seemingly pulled Dartmouth out of reach. That did not last long, though. Webster’s third bucket from downtown, this time with 0:32 to go, brought the Crimson within two and the packed Lavieties’ crowd to its feet.“Christian’s shots were amazing, for him to hit those threes,” Amaker said. “It was obvious that we did some incredible things down the stretch there to gain momentum, the confidence to push through, and to close.”The co-captain’s three buckets sparked Harvard’s comeback run, and a layup by Chambers tied the game in regulation. After the break, the Crimson hit the ground running, pulling away by as many as seven before finally closing with an 82-77 victory.“It was impressive, how they dug it out,” Amaker said.The win helped Harvard preserve its perfect 2-0 start to conference play. If not for Harvard's clutch, crunch-time play, Dartmouth would have set a poor precedent for visiting Ancient Eight opponents.“We had to do things right, and things that we practiced,” Amaker said. “And our kids believed in it. We were confident that we would pull through. I’m very pleased for our team, and [it was] a sensational win for our program.”—Staff writer Brenna R. Nelsen  can be reached at brennanelsen@college.harvard.edu.

Chris Brown throws punches like it's going out of style. Last Sunday, the irreverent R&amp;B singer beefed with Frank Ocean—whose debut album ""channel ORANGE"" wowed critics last year—over a parking space outside of Westlake Studio in Los Angeles. Brown has previously exchanged fisticuffs—and bottles—with former ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"" star Drake in a New York nightclub. Like an active volcano or a Kardashian sex tape scandal, it seems the question with Brown isn't whether he will strike again, but when. As a public safety precaution, the Arts blog has provided a list of the top five people Brown is most likely to fight next. You have been forewarned.<!--more-->1. Wiz KhalifaBrown has already beat down the top three people in Ghostface Killah's <a href=""http://rapsandhustles.com/2011/03/03/ghostface-killah-top-10-softest-rappers-in-the-game/"">""Top 10 Softest Rappers in the Game"" list, and Wiz Khalifa is next up at number four. If Brown is going for a high score, he has to go through Khalifa.2. Dick CheneyOur trigger-happy former vice president is known for several things, including his steadfast refusal to acknowledge climate change as a real problem. On the other hand, in his opus ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6QRzaPcvhM"">Big Booty Judy,"" Brown argues persuasively that he is indeed feeling a perceptible increase in temperature: ""Dress so elegant, ass like an elephant / Shorty got me hotter than I've ever been."" This could be a showdown of epic proportions, unless Cheney shoots Brown in the face first.
3. Betty WhiteThis one probably isn't that likely, but if it does happen, let's hope it's on the set of ""Hot in Cleveland.""4. Lindsay LohanThe former child star is known for two things: her fiery temper and her love of free parking. Brown's latest incident only goes to show just how scarce parking is in Los Angeles is, and it's frightening to think what would happen if these two firebrands tried to pull into the same spot at the same time.5. Chris BrownBrown hates it when people get all up in his grill, and no one has shown more skill at sticking his nose where it doesn't belong than Brown himself. One of these days, Brown might just teach himself a lesson in minding his own business.

Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino announced a partnership between Harvard and MIT that will bring edX—the rapidly growing online education venture started by both universities last spring—to the Boston community during his State of the City address Tuesday night.“I am pleased to announce a pilot with Harvard, MIT, and edX that will bring free courses to community centers,” Menino said in the speech, which was delivered before a large audience including Massachussetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, Congressman Michael E. Capuano, and Victoria R. Kennedy, wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.The proposed agreement will give edX a location-based platform for the first time, providing Boston residents access to knowledge and skills as well as time with faculty and job trainers.“Imagine a day when our community centers are little campuses in their own neighborhoods, full of vibrant groups of neighbors, exchanging ideas and making progress together,” Menino said, rousing applause from the crowd. “This initiative is a first, important step in that direction. We must connect adults in our neighborhoods with the opportunities of the knowledge economy.”The new partnership is part of a larger education policy launched by the Mayor that will provide $30 million in new funding to underperforming schools in order to upgrade facilities, add teaching time, and enhance teaching and leadership.
The edX partnership will require contributions from both the city and the universities involved with edX to expand the program, which is currently structured around online courses for individuals. The ultimate goal is to facilitate a community-based group learning experience, according to a memo released by Menino. While the city will provide locations for community learning, research, and internship and job opportunities, edX, along with Harvard and MIT, will hold “Neighborhood Hours,” in-person meetings with university students and faculty. Harvard, MIT, and edX will also provide training on how to use the edX system, career counseling, and job transitioning programs.“I’m very excited. [The partnership] brings technology into the neighborhoods of Boston. That’s so, so important. I think there are a lot of folks out there who could use that program,” Menino said after the event. “I look forward to edX, MIT, Harvard, Suffolk University, and some other universities stepping up to the plate to work with us.”In his address, Menino also said that he intends to appoint a women’s workforce council, improve access to quality child care, and launch “Women on Main,” a networking opportunity for women who own businesses in the main streets of Boston.Menino, who is 70 and recently spent two months in the hospital due to complications from a blood clot, entered the hall walking with a cane to Kelly Clarkson’s “What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger” and a five-minute standing ovation. “I was humbled by [the ovation],” he said after the speech. “And I know the question was, ‘Can he walk down the aisle?’ Give me a break. I could walk down that aisle 10 times.”The speech also ended with the Clarkson hit.Asked after the speech if an appropriate headline for the evening might be ‘Boston Strong, Menino Strong,’ the Mayor replied enthusiastically. “Yeah, no question. Stronger.”—Staff writer Matthew Q. Clarida can be reached at clarida@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Amna H. Hashmi can be reached at amnahashmi@college.harvard.edu.

A few infamous alumni and a Winklevoss twin later, the characters decide that ""low-def"" Boston is far superior to its academic cousin.The episode may not pay much attention to us, but at least it has eternally erudite Peter Griffin claiming that he's at ""Harvard, the smartest school in the country.""

When it hired Imry Halevi in November, Harvard Athletics made a commitment to improved multimedia productions and sent a message to its fans that it was seeking to push the Harvard sports brand nationwide. Halevi, the current Director of Multimedia and Production, aims to use local, regional, and national broadcasters to distribute improved in-house content across the nation.“I think that Harvard Athletics has great potential [for expansion] with such a great history and tradition in college sports,” Halevi said. “The question is not whether you have a large budget or the best equipment. Rather, it’s whether you put in the time and effort to pull together a first-class production. I think that at Harvard, we have the infrastructure to do that.”Harvard is the first Ivy League school to create the position now held by Halevi, who was previous the Associate Director of Video Production at Northeastern University. The Maccabim, Israel, native produced the first ever collegiate women’s ice hockey game on the ESPN family of networks in addition to producing some 100 broadcasts last season.“We feel like Imry is one of the most talented people who has worked in athletics and the video production side of the business,” said Northeastern athletic director Peter Roby. “He was a tremendous asset to us and put us in a leadership position for college athletics at our level with the sophistication, organization, and quality of production he helped us attain. He helped produce quality content everywhere and we are sorry to see him go, but feel fortunate that we had him for the time that he did.”Halevi said that an expansion in Crimson coverage on national networks could have a major effect on recruiting for the school. Harvard’s lack of athletic scholarships creates one obstacle to its recruiting efforts, and that disadvantage is only amplified by the dearth of national media coverage it receives in comparison to larger schools from major sports conferences.
“I think that, depending on the specific sport and the specific coaches, online video productions can greatly contribute to recruitment,” Halevi said. “Prospective student athletes have a chance to watch Harvard’s teams play before they come…and parents of [these athletes] know that they’ll be able to watch their daughter or son play on campus even if they cannot make it to Boston for every game.”Currently, Harvard sports are not readily accessible through alternative media forms like tablets and smartphones. Halevi says that he will stress expanding coverage to allow more access for fans on the go in an effort to expand the Crimson’s fan base and build loyalty.“If people like to watch sports on their iPhones and iPads, we need to make sure that our content is easily available there. If people like on-demand videos on their TVs, we should look into getting into that field,” Halevi said. “The easier we make it for people to find our content, the more likely we’ll be to get new fans for Harvard Athletics and get people to come to games on campus.”At Northeastern, in addition to overseeing all hiring and training for the video production team, Halevi was the executive producer for all of Northeastern’s broadcasts on ESPN and its family of networks. This included ESPN3—likely the only medium through which many Crimson fans have streamed a game online.One immediate goal of the new department is to improve Harvard’s streaming technology—Halevi aims to put it “on the same level as the best college streams [in] the country.”In his first few months, his efforts have largely focused on updating the department’s streaming equipment in an effort to achieve that goal. But as Halevi looks long-term, he hopes to create a media department on par with the nation’s best.“There are several schools in New England and around the country that do a good job at producing and broadcasting their games online who rely on a variety of different setups from high-end equipment and freelance professional staff to mid-range equipment and all-student staff,” Halevi said. “I think what will be interesting to see is where we end up on that spectrum. There is no doubt that Harvard Athletics has the potential to have one of the best productions in the country. Now all that’s left is to figure out is how we’ll get there.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Harvard’s winter break is a long one. In 2012, the last fall term exam took place on December 20, with classes resuming this Monday, 39 days later. For many Harvard undergraduates, the lengthy respite means more time spent with the family and friends. For some it means travel to other continents; for others, more earnings and work experience. And for a swelling subsection of Harvard undergraduates, it means more hours spent absorbing the pixelated plot of a television show. It means more binge-watching.The Los Angeles Times <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/15/entertainment/la-ca-netflix-essay-20120115"">defines binge television as “any instance in which more than three episodes of an hourlong drama or six episodes of a half-hour comedy are consumed at one sitting.” The phenomenon extends well beyond the college campus. Primary binge-watching enabler Netflix <a href=""http://www.boston.com/business/technology/2013/01/23/the-numbers-netflix-subscribers/i7wmi9qLnKuHuvEcBSXJcO/story.html"">registered 27.1 million domestic subscribers for its online streaming program as of December 31, up two million in the fourth quarter. In fact, its better-than-expected growth has helped drive the NFLX stock value out of the doldrums, with a 42 percent jump just <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/25/business/la-fi-ct-netflix-recovery-20130125"">last Thursday. And while the service has added users, its viewers have also become more intensive—television shows watched per week <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303740704577521300806686174.html"">have risen 38 percent for Netflix customers since 2009, The Wall Street Journal reports.As might be expected, the rise of binge-watching has met with its share of negative reception, and the name surely doesn’t help. The word “binge” carries a pejorative sting, conjuring phrases such as “binge-eating,” “binge-drinking,” and “spending binge.” The word, <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/binge"">per Dictionary.com, denotes “excess,” but not a positive sort—we have no “generosity binge” or “binge-caring.” Binge is bad, not supererogatory. And beneath that basic PR problem, binge-watching consists of prolonged, passive stagnation in front of a screen, a difficult activity (or inactivity) to defend with much gusto.But television has endured those complaints since its inception. <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t01.htm"">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American spends 2.75 hours watching TV every day, with television surpassed only by the biological necessities of sleeping and eating (and not mutually exclusive with the latter). Maybe we need to reevaluate behavior (or simply pick up a book on occasion), but television-watching is a form of leisure, and although the prolonged sitting during binge-watching can lead long-term health issues, that offers a common-sense argument for occasional pauses, not against stringing shows together.Much more worth discussing is the commentary that centers on aesthetics, specifically the shift in viewing experience that binge-watching has produced. Binge-watching has reduced the time between episodes from a week to mere seconds—which can even be counted down during the credits, if you let Netflix’s “post play” feature automatically start the next episode for you. <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/07/09/binge_watching_tv_why_you_need_to_stop_.html"">An article last July from Slate Magazine sees this as a negative because “episodes have their own integrity, which is blurred by watching several in a row.” True, almost all television shows are designed for weekly viewership, but a similar complaint might be levied against the move away from serialization of the novel. And nineteenth century literature isn’t read today with month- or week-long pauses, despite some advantages to the old practice. Readers of Dostoyevsky’s Brothers Karamazov, for instance, were left to ruminate <a href=""http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/DS/07/087.shtml"">for a month on his great challenge to the divine, “The Grand Inquisitor,” before the author’s counterarguments appeared in print. Yet one of the unique qualities of the novel is the reader’s control of its pace; binge-watching allows TV viewers a bit more control, too.
Of course, most serialized novels were written with an eye toward eventual publication in full, but a similar impulse has hit TV shows. The former Fox show “Arrested Development,” kept relevant in part through binge-watching, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/arrested-development-netflix-season-4_n_2442077.html"">plans an upcoming Netflix-exclusive season to be released—and consumed—in bulk. And even serialized shows are keeping down-the-road viewers in mind: “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303740704577521300806686174.html"">has suggested that binge-watchers may be “more rewarded” by the intricacies of plot he has worked to integrate. Another creator, David Simon, of HBO’s “The Wire,” which left the air in 2008, has <a href=""http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/the-game-never-ends-david-simon-on-wearying-wire-love-and-the-surprising-usefulness-of-twitter/?src=tp#h[TrOnc,6]"">expressed (and later clarified) “amused contempt” for latecomer binge-viewers. But “The Wire” in particular with its ornate webs of characters and season-long plot arcs, has showcased the unique offerings of post-serial life.  “It was conceived of as a whole, and we did it as a whole,” Simon <a href=""http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/the-game-never-ends-david-simon-on-wearying-wire-love-and-the-surprising-usefulness-of-twitter/?src=tp#h[TrOnc,6]"">has said. That idea left the show languishing with low ratings while it ran on air—but flourishing when binge-viewers discovered it.This isn’t to call binge-watching unequivocally better than the old serialized system. But it is something distinct and worth appreciating. And it is fascinating. The modern age, as commenters so often lament, is a condensed, quick world. The average presidential election TV sound bite has slipped from 43 seconds in 1968 to under eight seconds of late. Thoughts face 140-character caps. And we are impatient: 32 percent of internet consumers will abandon slow sites after one to five seconds of delay.

This month, five states announced that they are <a href=""http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130125/POLITICS02/301250376/"">considering joining Maine and Nebraska in apportioning electoral votes in presidential elections by congressional district, rather than by the current winner-takes-all setup. If these changes had been made prior to November’s election, President Obama would have won by a margin of only 30 electoral votes rather than his actual 126. If all 50 states went by this “proportional” method, Mitt Romney would be our current president, having won the 2012 election <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/electoral-college-changes-would-pose-danger-for-democrats/"">277 to 261. This doesn’t mean Romney had majority support behind him—he only managed an appropriate 47 percent of the popular vote. His hypothetical victory is a result of weirdly shaped gerrymandered districts synthesized by Republican legislatures to always go red. Only a handful of people seriously want to extend the horrors of gerrymandering to presidential elections (though this handful includes <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/reince-priebus-backs-electoral-vote-change-but-its-states-decision-fp8bqc3-186720481.html"">Republican National Committee Chairman <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/reince-priebus-backs-electoral-vote-change-but-its-states-decision-fp8bqc3-186720481.html"">Reince Priebus) but this does raise the question: What national election process could best replace the Electoral College? This in turn raises a more apposite question: Why are we trying to get rid of the Electoral College in the first place?America’s unique method of electing a president has had its share of opponents throughout the years, and it’s time we gave it a break. An overwhelming majority of criticisms of the system are invalid, and the ones that are valid are, well, not too terrible. Perhaps most importantly, a switch is politically infeasible, as the necessary constitutional amendment would undoubtedly be blocked by the smaller states. We should only be talking about reform if we find some incontrovertibly superior option, and the most popular alternative—the aptly named popular vote—has even more problems. All things considered, the Electoral College is okay.A favorite complaint of reform proponents argues that the Electoral College doesn’t care who the most popular candidate is and elects a president that might not reflect the will of a plurality of U.S. citizens. This is admittedly true, in the same way that Congress can enact a law without popular support and the President can appoint a Cabinet member opposed by a majority of Americans. The Constitution outlines a representative democracy, so it’s not a failing of our elections if we don’t follow the rules of direct democracy—it’s a clear sign we’re doing something right.Some of the College’s more inventive opponents like concocting outlandish hypotheticals to stress the irrelevance of public opinion in the system today. Yes, it’s possible for a candidate to become president with about 22 percent of the popular vote (by winning a collection of small states by one vote each and losing the rest unanimously). Yes, it’s possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election 535 to 3 (by winning Wyoming by 51 votes and losing every other state and D.C. by one vote). It’s also possible, and far more statistically likely, for a candidate to be fatally <a href=""http://www.deseretnews.com/article/392575/ONLY-IN-FLORIDA-DOES-COCAINE-DROP-FROM-SKY.html?pg=all"">struck by a bale of cocaine falling from a drug-smuggling plane. So let’s stick to our empirical examples: In 53 out of 57 elections the Electoral College has elected the plurality’s favorite.Another common criticism bemoans the focus on the select few swing states with the statistical potential to decide the election. But this doesn’t acknowledge that the focus on swing states is a good thing. No specific state is favored by this approach: Preference is only given to states with the greatest political diversity at the time of the election. This tempers the political dialogue between the two parties, forcing them to appeal to the center rather than play up fringe interests that would only get them more votes in already solid states. Under a popular vote scenario, candidates would have to cater toward big cities—not exactly bastions of centrism—and systematically disenfranchise suburban and rural voters.
A final notable objection to the Electoral College is that it marginalizes third-party candidates, who have very little hope of carrying even a single state, let alone winning the presidency. While this is true, people seem to think this means any position not currently taken by either party has no chance of ever becoming national policy. All it really means is that a stance has to be adopted by one of the two major parties to become an issue in an election, essentially needing the support of over a quarter of Americans (a crass estimate, for sure) to be seriously considered on a national stage. Under the popular vote, third-party candidates supporting fringe positions rejected by both parties would distract from the issues with more widespread appeal. Imagine a segregationist candidate running in a 21st century election, thus granting airtime and legitimacy to a now generally rejected position. This could be devastating to the political process. So can we drop this popular vote reform business and get angry about things that matter?Milo B. Beckman ’15 is an applied mathematics concentrator in Eliot House.

High preseason expectations and abysmal recent performances have combined to create a perfect storm of disappointment for the Harvard men’s hockey team (5-13-1, 3-11 ECAC). The Crimson, which both major preseason polls picked to finish third in the ECAC, has lost six straight and 10 of its last 11.This weekend, Harvard returned to the Bright Hockey Center after a difficult seven-game road stand only to fall to Clarkson, 5-1, and St. Lawrence, 4-3 (OT). Now that the last-place Crimson sits more than a game behind its closest ECAC rival, fans may be more than ready to play The Blame Game.Who is the easiest target of The Blame Game? The most obvious answer is Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. Fans may lump this month with a long string of recent underachieving Januaries for Donato’s squads. Over the past three seasons, Harvard has posted only five wins in 29 January games. Midseason hockey disappointment has become something of a Harvard tradition.But this is no ordinary midseason slump. X’s and O’s or a different man behind the bench cannot adequately explain the Crimson’s woes. Rather, Blame Gamers may directly trace Harvard’s difficulties to a depleted defensive corps. A gaping hole in the Harvard blue line has sunk the Crimson’s ship this season.On Dec. 10, the then-No. 18 Harvard men’s hockey team hosted an unranked UMass-Lowell squad. The results weren’t pretty. The Riverhawks steamrolled the Crimson, 5-0, handing Harvard its worst home loss since 2008.
Before the puck was dropped in that game, sophomore defensemen Max Everson and Patrick McNally, who had played in all seven of the team’s previous games, were taken off of the roster. The loss of these two key defenders promised to hurt. Last year, the ECAC had named McNally, a Vancouver Canucks draft pick, to its all-rookie first team. Everson, a Toronto Maple Leafs prospect, had appeared in all 34 of the Crimson’s games as a freshman.During the 5-0 loss, it was clear that the shorthanded Harvard squad would have to make some significant adjustments. At the drop of a hat, Harvard lost one-third of its primary defensive corps. As the Crimson prepares for the first round of the Beanpot, Harvard fans should not underestimate the extent to which the midseason developments have impacted their team’s physical state and talent level.The departures placed an immediate burden on the Crimson’s six remaining defenders. Everybody was on the front lines. In recent weeks, injuries have often forced the Crimson to rotate fewer than six defensemen. Saturday against St. Lawrence, Harvard played only four.The situation has also required several Crimson players to assume significantly larger roles midway through the season. Everson and McNally were immediately replaced by juniors Danny Fick and John Caldwell, two ECAC all-academic selections who had only appeared in a combined 25 games for the Crimson last season. When freshman defender Desmond Bergin sustained an injury earlier this month, the Crimson called up junior JP Gillmeister from the Harvard club hockey team to suit up for two games.The results during the absence of Everson and McNally speak for themselves.Since their names were deleted from the roster, the Crimson has not won a single game in regulation. The team’s last regulation win came on Nov. 16 over Cornell.At the beginning of the season, Harvard’s goals-against average with the defensive duo in the lineup was 2.14. Without them, it’s 4.25.And with McNally off the power play unit, the Crimson’s success rate has dropped precipitously. Last year, Harvard converted 27.4 percent of its opportunities to lead the NCAA. This year, Harvard is dead-last in the ECAC at 10.5 percent.Co-captain and defenseman Danny Biega has been unable to approach the Orr-esque numbers of seasons past. The defenseman has recorded only five points (all assists) this season, well off the pace for a third 30-point season.Another Crimson hockey “tradition” in recent years has been the late-season resurgence. In the last two seasons, Harvard rebounded from disappointing midseason performances to finish strongly. In 2011, a sub-.400 Crimson squad went 7-1 after the Beanpot before falling to Dartmouth in the ECAC quarterfinals. In 2012, the team that set a record for the most ties in an NCAA season found a way to win late, making a surprising run to the conference final.In 2013, Harvard will receive another late-season opportunity to reassert itself. The Crimson’s 6-5 comeback, overtime win over No. 8 Boston University on Jan. 9 speaks to Harvard’s talent and heart. But as the Crimson continues to struggle with its impossible defensive dilemma, Harvard fans may have little hope that the tradition will continue.—Staff writer Michael D.

Rare is the elected official who maintains his or her support for term limits after actually winning the job, a fact evidenced by the paltry number of co-sponsors on the amendment introduced by Pat J. Toomey ’84 at the beginning of this Congress. To the surprise of no one, these advocates are (almost) all newly elected Republicans, the demographic in the Senate with the least to lose from imposing limitations that would most immediately affect their more senior colleagues (perhaps putting some Democratic-held seats in play). While it is easy to mask political expediency sub specie boni, politicians of all stripes should embrace the principle of term limits, regardless of its impact on their career intentions.The argument against term limits is so well known that it has become axiomatic. Such restrictions on the membership of legislative bodies, it is insisted, would eliminate officials just as they’ve grown knowledgeable about key issues and influential among their peers. Term limits also would be anathema to democracy, as they necessarily restrict the choices present to voters. “We already have term limits,” opponents assert, dutifully providing a civics lesson to the <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/159881/americans-call-term-limits-end-electoral-college.aspx"">75 percent of Americans that support curbing the amount of time their leaders can spend living off their dime. “They’re called elections!”Anyone who makes this latter argument has either a jejune understanding of political science or, more plausibly, is an elected official himself. Only a starry-eyed tyro to the workings of the world could possibly contend with a straight face that elections currently provide citizens with the unrestrained ability to choose new representatives. After all, the advantage of incumbency is well documented throughout American history. To see it, one need look no further than the past election, when over three-fourths of those in Congress were reelected, despite the body’s 9 percent approval rating—a figure making it <a href=""http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-somewhere-below-cockroaches-traffic-jams-and-nickleback-in-americans-esteem.html"">less popular than colonoscopies, used car salesmen, and lice. As it turns out, it is a lot easier to run for office when your living expenses are already footed by Uncle Sam.The other argument in opposition to term limits is more difficult to discredit. The notion that a politician gets better at his job the longer he does it is intuitive—that’s true of every professional. However, one has to remember that public service is not just any profession but rather the embodiment of governing principles. Term limits would downplay the role of individuals’ influence in the legislative bodies. Do we really want our laws to be determined by which states have delegations most likely to be found in a Georgetown geriatric ward?For years, Hawaii held outsize sway in the Senate due to the high positions held by superannuated veterans Daniel K. Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye, the latter of which had represented the islands since they achieved statehood in 1959. While citizens of the 11th-least populous state did not bemoan the importance of influence in Congress at any point during the last half-century, the simultaneity of Inouye’s death and Akaka’s retirement has put them in the precarious position in which no one in their entire Congressional delegation has served for longer than two years. This could pose a bit of an issue for the state that currently receives the <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/business/hawaii-alaska-states-get-most-federal-money-953733"">fourth-most taxpayer dollars.
Opponents of term limits often paint the picture of a hapless naïf with big dreams walking into Congress unable to deal with the diversity and subtlety of issues that the experienced professionals have spent years learning. Again this viewpoint is both too idealistic and fundamentally dishonest about the real-world apparatus of the legislative branch of the United States government. Members of Congress do not live in some cloistered world, à la the Supreme Court, in which the ideas manifest in their policy proposals are purely their own. Rather, they turn to staff lawyers to craft bills on issues they want to support. Most don’t even read the bills they are supposed to be making informed decisions on. This is not because they are congressional tenderfoots, but rather because the current proceedings do not provide enough time to carefully examine the thousands of bills introduced each year.The reason that term limit legislation continually dies in Congress is obvious. It is poison hemlock, and, unfortunately, so few of our elected officials are veritable Socratics. Too many politicians look at Congress as a way to increase their statuses and pad their pocketbooks. The argument that the Methuselahs of D.C. are the only ones who can tackle the nation’s problems is a sophomoric one. We manage to find a new and capable president every eight years; there is no reason we can’t find fresh blood from each state to protect the nation’s interests. Besides, it’s not like there isn’t already a professional government class in the district ready to help the newbies out.John F. M.

For the first time in the history of the U.S. military, women will be allowed to serve in combat alongside their male counterparts without any gender-based discrimination. Outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta made the historic announcement last Thursday, effectively lifting the ban on women serving in ground combat roles. By rescinding the ban, the military is taking a crucial and long-awaited step to align itself with core American ideals of equality. Furthermore, a fully inclusive military will allow for the most talented service members to be recruited without taking their gender into account, thereby improving the quality of the military.Historically, the contributions of the women in the U.S. military have been devalued by an institutionalized gender bias against them. The specific ban that is being rescinded was established in 1994 restricting women from serving on the frontlines of the battlefield.  Not only did this prevent capable women from serving their country to their fullest capacity, but the lack of battlefield experience also <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2013/01/23/military_lifts_ban_on_women_in_combat/"">inhibited women from rising up the ranks in the military to the same degree as men.However, particularly over the last 10 years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, women have proven their value time and time again. Although they weren’t officially allowed to serve in combat roles, the reality of the battlefield in these theaters of war led to women often being drawn into combat. Their performance in these situations convinced Secretary of Defense Panetta and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey, that there was no longer any reason to proscribe women from serving in these roles.In the past few days most people have welcomed the change. However, a few have continued to speak out against women in combat. Among the opposition is Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/politics/formally-lifting-a-combat-ban-military-chiefs-stress-equal-opportunity.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0"">said that the committee might “introduce legislation to stop any changes we believe to be detrimental to our fighting forces and their capabilities.”  Those that oppose the ban have echoed the Senator’s sentiment, suggesting that any gains in equality in the military would be overshadowed by a decrease in effectiveness. Although the transition to opening more high-level roles to women will surely not come without any obstacles, the opposition’s argument is baseless because the evaluation for these new positions will be gender neutral. Thus women and men will be held to the same standards.All the branches of the military will proceed in developing plans to phase in women by May 15 of this year. Although the initial stages of this new era of equality in the military surely won’t be free of unforeseen consequences, overall we should welcome this change as one that will not only allow our military to realize the full potential of its members, but also to achieve a level of equality that reflects the ideals of our country.

Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and student supporters protested outside of Massachusetts Hall all day on Tuesday to urge the University to agree to favorable terms in continuing contract negotiations.The previous contract between the University and HUCTW—which represents more than 4,600 non-faculty Harvard staff—expired July 1 of last year. Because the two sides have been unable to agree on the details of the new contract, the old contract is still in effect. The two largest points of disagreement in the negotiations involve salary increases and health care benefits.“The salary increase that the University is holding us at is not good enough,” Linda Kluz, Communications Coordinator at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, said. “It doesn’t even meet the rise in the cost of living.”At 5:30 p.m., 20 protesters stood outside Mass. Hall, holding signs bearing the message “Invest in the Staff.” Protesters were present all day Tuesday starting at 8:30 a.m., and the group plans to protest at the same time every Tuesday and Thursday until the negotiations are resolved.“The University is for all of us,” said Susan M. Kinsella, an administrative coordinator in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department who is also on the executive board of HUCTW. “We don’t want anything except for what we think we deserve as outstanding staff members that help keep the University going.”
In a statement released on Sept. 27, 2012, the University said that wage offers made by the University in negotiations with HUCTW were “clearly consistent with the internal and external job markets.”The University also said in that statement that its pay to HUCTW members was “very competitive” according to benchmark comparisons with the external market.People walking through the Yard stopped to speak with the protesters, to learn more about the contract negotiations, or to voice their support.The Student Labor Action Movement has organized a Solidarity Hour from 4 to 5 p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday, during which SLAM members will stand with the protesters to show their support for the union’s stance in the contract negotiations.“The lack of respect and dignity for workers is outrageous, especially in a country that has so much prosperity,” Elena F. Hoffenberg ’16, a member of SLAM, said. “It’s very upsetting for me to be a part of a community where workers are being treated in such ways, so I’m doing everything I can to change that fact.”Other students got involved in the HUCTW protests through the Unite Harvard Wintersession program, which focused on progressive action and activism at Harvard and was sponsored by 14 different student groups. Participants in the program joined the first HUCTW protest last Tuesday.“I’m standing in solidary with all the HUCTW workers because it makes me angry that Harvard isn’t trying to negotiate,” said Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, who participated in Unite Harvard.—Staff writer Christine Y. Cahill can be reached at christinecahill@college.harvard.edu.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Jan. 30, 2013Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the date on which the University released a statement defending its wage offers in negotiations with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. In fact, that statement came out on Sept. 27, 2012, not this past Thursday.

Coming off the excitement of a last-minute comeback win against Ivy League opponent Dartmouth last Saturday, the Harvard men’s basketball team faces two league rivals at home this weekend, hosting Yale on Friday and Brown the following evening. The Crimson (10-6, 2-0 Ivy) currently holds an early half game lead in the Ivy League race over Princeton, the only other undefeated team.Last Saturday, Harvard struggled for much of the game against a Big Green team that owns the worst overall record in the conference. Yet, after being down 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Crimson tied up the game thanks to a string of threes by co-captain Christian Webster, several Dartmouth missed free throws, and a clutch lay-up from freshman Siyani Chambers. Harvard scored 20 points in overtime and held on to win by five.“The most amazing comeback ever,” Webster said after the game. “I’m at a loss for words.”The Crimson struggled from the field against the Big Green, especially from deep. While it finished the game with five makes from beyond the arc, three of them came in the final three minute of regulation. For the season, Harvard is 22nd in its division in field goal percentage, shooting around 48 percent. The team also shoots above 40 percent from beyond the arc.Despite his squad’s slow start, Webster was named Ivy League Co-player of the week for the first time this season. Chambers continued to rack up awards, earning his fifth Ivy Rookie of the week, approaching the record of eight.
The Bulldogs (7-12, 1-1) also come into the contest following an overtime win. After losing the conference opener versus the Bears the previous week, Yale built an 11-point lead in its rematch game only to quickly lose momentum and face an extra period. It managed to outscore Brown by 11 in overtime, though, and won, 75-64.Touted freshman big man Justin Sears has spearheaded the Bulldogs down low thus far this season. He averages 10.6 points and leads the team with 6.4 rebounds per game. At 6’8”, he will pose a tough match-up for a relatively small Crimson team, which ranks 311th in the NCAA in boards per game.Conversely, the Bears (7-9, 1-1) are hoping to rebound from last weekend’s loss. Brown is a frontcourt-oriented team, led by senior Matt Sullivan, a tall guard who is also strong on the boards. On the season Sullivan averages 14.8 points per game to go along with 5.1 rebounds.  Junior Sean McGonagill averages 14.6 and the guard pair accounts for 49 percent of their squad’s points.The team also boasts two big men taller than 6’8” who post more than seven rebounds per contest. Sophomore Rafael Maia, in his first season of activity, has averaged a team high 7.9 boards, including a season high of 15.To go along with the strong play of Webster and Chambers, the latter of whom leads the Ivy League with 6.1 assists per game, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker emphasized the importance of the sophomore class’s production.“Our sophomore class is a key group for us,” said Amaker after the Dartmouth game. “Jonah [Travis], Steve [Mondou-Missi], Kenyatta [Smith], and Wesley [Saunders]. I think that’s the group that’s going to have the chance to have an impact on us as a team.”Saunders has put up some of the strongest statistics so far this season for the Crimson, averaging 16.3 points per game and leading the team in rebounding. He tallied 20 points against Dartmouth, including 13 in the second half. Classmate Smith also helped out against the Big Green, grabbing six boards in just 11 minutes of play and preventing Dartmouth from several second chances opportunities.“They were playing their butts off in every facet of the game,” said Webster. “The big guys were driving and getting off shots.”—Staff writer Jacob W.

When Joseph D. Brain delivered the first lecture of his new physiology course “The Human Organism” in 1971, scientists had not yet eradicated smallpox, profiled DNA, or discovered HIV.The men and women who filled the seats of Brain’s classroom that first day had only just begun living in the same residential Houses months before. And when they signed up for his class, these undergraduates enrolled under the old General Education curriculum, which would not be superseded by the new Core Curriculum for another eight years.On Monday, more than four decades later, Brain delivered his first lecture of another semester of the course now titled Science of Living Systems 17: “The Human Organism”—for the 40th and final time. Brain, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, has decided this semester’s offering of the course will be his last as he plans to devote more time to research. He has only skipped one year of teaching the course since its inception.Despite the changes that have swept the scientific community and Harvard’s campus since the course was first offered more than 40 years ago, the fundamental mission of the class has remained unchanged: to make “The Human Organism” relevant to topics in public health, undergraduate interests in the humanities and social sciences, and current events.SCIENCE WITHOUT BORDERS

In 1971, two years after joining the faculty at the School of Public Health, Brain decided that he wanted to teach undergraduates to think more critically about public health. At the time, he felt that College students lacked knowledge about the discipline, which he believed had important connections to subjects beyond medicine or even science.“The context is that health really is a big deal. Whether you feel well or if you get certain diseases, it’s a huge part of our life, and it’s a huge part of the economy,” Brain said in an interview last week. “I really want people to understand the determinants of health: of their own individual health, of the people of the United States, global health.”From the beginning, Brain sought to use the lecture component of the course to emphasize connections between his subject material and public health trends. But about ten years into teaching the class, he altered its structure to better reflect that goal.He introduced topic sections devoted to exploring a specific subject, such as tuberculosis or obesity, into the section component of the course. Students in topic sections choose a focus within that subject and work toward writing a term paper.Undergraduates who have taken the course say that the topic sections have given them a new perspective on public health. Rebecca A. Betensky ’87, a former student in the course, translated her topic section into a career path. Though she originally took Brain’s course to fulfill a Core requirement, her section on epidemiology helped her fine tune her interest in math into a passion for biostatistics.“That was really enlightening to me,” Betensky said. “It was really exciting for me to see some applications of math in medical and scientific research, so that really sparked my interest in biostatistics.”Betensky went on to get her Ph.D. in the subject. She is now a professor of biostatistics at the School of Public Health.JACKS OF ALL TRADESBrain has also sought to make his course relevant to non-science undergraduates. He says it is not designed for science students and estimates that only about 15 to 20 percent of students enrolled in the past have studied math or science.Nancy C. Long Sieber, a longtime instructor for the course who once taught a topic section on battlefield medicine, said “The Human Organism” offers students the chance to explore diverse interests.

UPDATED: January 30, 2013, at 4:40 p.m.The Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs announced Tuesday that Dr. Gary S. Samore, White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism under President Barack Obama, has been tapped to lead the center as its executive director. He will assume the position on Monday.“Gary Samore is an outstanding choice for the Belfer Center executive director position,” said Samore’s predecessor, Army Brigadier General Kevin Ryan. “He has exceptional academic credentials and experience in leading research institutions and of course he is a distinguished alumnus of the Belfer Center.”Samore worked briefly at the Belfer Center after graduating with a Ph.D. in government from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1984. Since then, he has held a variety of research and governmental posts and has worked for both the Clinton and Obama administrations.“Gary Samore is the very model of a Belfer Center professional,” Center Director Graham T. Allison ’62 said in a press release. “We count ourselves fortunate that one of the nation’s leaders in both thought and action on the core issues of the Center’s agenda will bring his rich experience to our community.”
In the Obama White House, Samore advised the president on matters concerning arms control, WMD proliferation, and terrorism.  His position under President Obama came after he played a key role in negotiating the end of North Korea’s nuclear program as President Bill Clinton’s Special Assistant and Senior Director for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls at the National Security Council.Samore continued his negotiation efforts under President Obama, helping to contract the New START arms control agreement with Russia. His Obama-era resume also includes efforts to battle terrorism and quash Iranian nuclear ambitions.When he arrives in Cambridge, Samore’s obligations will be more academic in nature. Along with co-chairing the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Working Group and managing and advising the Belfer Center’s research plans, he will also conduct his own research.After Samore assumes his position, Ryan will preside over new programs on defense and intelligence at the Belfer Center. Ryan expressed optimism about the prospect of Samore’s return.“We’re excited to have him back,” Ryan said.—Staff writer Steven R. Watros can be reached at watros@college.harvard.edu.

With the Science Center Plaza construction project approaching completion on schedule, Harvard officials are touting the space’s potential to become a bustling communal gathering area.About eight months after construction began last May, workers have now completed many of the planned surface improvements outside the Science Center and opened additional pathways across the plaza, which is now almost fully paved with gray stone. Paver installation and trucking will continue throughout this month, according to the Harvard University Construction Mitigation website.Most of the major construction work is expected to be finished by April in time for the annual Arts First festival, University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall wrote in an emailed statement. Construction is expected to be completely wrapped up by the summer of 2013, a target date in accordance with the timeline that administrators previously laid out for the project.The construction project, a partnership between Harvard and the City of Cambridge, is taking place alongside a city effort to make utility infrastructure improvements to the Cambridge Street tunnel’s roof and drainage system.The University integrated the Science Center Plaza project into its Common Spaces initiative, aimed at further developing campus areas where members of the Harvard community can come together.
According to Marshall, “the goal of the Science Center Plaza project is to improve pedestrian and bike access and to create a space that is inviting, usable, flexible and a destination for both the campus community and our neighbors.”Administrators ultimately intend to furnish the finished plaza with landscaped areas, tables, chairs, and modern wooden and stone benches.Despite the ongoing construction, which created a hassle for some undergraduates hurrying to class last fall, students have already begun to enjoy the Science Center Plaza space.This month, the Harvard Skate initiative brought a custom-made, 40-by-60-foot ice skating rink back to the Plaza for a second season.Jenny Fung ’16, who works with Harvard Skate, said the rink drew an unexpectedly large crowd of community members, including faculty members and their children, who came to enjoy hot chocolate and a bonfire during Wintersession.The rink, which provides on-site skate rentals and offers free access to all members of the community, is sponsored by Harvard’s Common Spaces program, Campus Services, and Harvard Student Agencies.Lisa Hogarty—Vice President for Campus Services, which manages the plaza and other campus common spaces—heralded the Harvard Skate program as an example of things to come.“Harvard Skate provides a great opportunity for the University community and our neighbors to come together,” Hogarty wrote in an emailed statement. “When the renovation of the Plaza is complete this spring, there will be many more events and activities, transforming the space.”—Staff writer Antonio Coppola can be reached at acoppola@college.harvard.edu.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Jan. 30, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated and included a headline indicating that the Science Center Plaza construction project is progressing ahead of schedule. In fact, while most of the major construction work is expected to be wrapped up by April, the project is on schedule to be completely finished by its summer target date.

It's time to pay homage to one of the great American traditions: the Super Bowl. Although the game is traditionally celebrated by consuming copious amounts of PBR and wings and participation in a betting pool, student athletes recently received a friendly email from Ryan Pekarek, a Compliance Intern from Harvard University's Department of Athletics, with the subject line ""Don't Bet On It."" The email reminded them that the NCAA prohibits ""engaging in gambling activities as they relate to intercollegiate ore professional sporting events.""So while the rest of America will put up <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2011/02/02/this-years-craziest-super-bowl-bets-business-sportsmoney.html"">$10 billion dollars over this Sunday's game, student athletes can't engage in sports wagering, defined as ""putting something at risk, such as an entry fee, with the opportunity to win something in return.""And just in case these NCAA, nationally ranked, physically agile, quick-thinking student-athletes didn’t get the message, the email also included the following formula:Entry Fee/Something wagered + Prize Opportunity = NOT PermissibleFair enough NCAA—this formula does seem rather foolproof. So what's a jock to do? No worries. While the rest of Harvard is throwing down big ones, here are some other items you could wager:<!--more-->
Your mess. It's a Super Bowl party—there’s going to be wings, dip, beer, plenty of shouting at the TV, and almost inevitable wreckage to your poor dorm room. Sure, the supporters of the losing team may be bummed, but you wage, you rage, you pay. As soon as the boo-hoos are over, it’s time to whip out the Clorox wipes to clean up their sorry mess. Your head. Don't worry, Flyby isn't talking literal heads—we don't encourage that sort of thing—but athletes could wager their luscious locks in support of their team. Losers should surrender their hair to the cuts and shaved patterns imagined by their friends. So even though your home team didn't win, you'll become a real headturner in the dhalls.

After a loss to Dartmouth last Saturday handed the Harvard women’s basketball team an early Ivy League loss and halted its six-game win streak against its Hanover opponents, the Crimson will try to get back on track this weekend when it faces Yale and Brown on the road.“You wipe the slate clean because I have always said, and I say again this year, anyone can be anyone in the Ivy League because it’s a very special conference,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We don’t have a postseason. Every game is huge and I think there’s just enormous pride.”Harvard (10-6, 1-1 Ivy) will arrive in New Haven fresh off the loss to the Big Green, 58-45, that saw the Crimson give up 28 turnovers to its opponents.“Turnovers were the name of the game,” Delaney-Smith said. “That was it, coupled with poor shooting, but we could have handled the poor shooting. We couldn’t handle 28 turnovers.”Controlling the ball will be necessary as the Harvard defense looks to contain a trio of high-scoring Bulldog (6-10, 1-1) guards.
“We know that Yale is a quick team,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “They like to shoot quick and play an up-tempo game. They’re in your face the whole game.”Junior Janna Graf put up team-high points against the Crimson last year in both Yale’s win, 68-63, and loss, 71-51. This season, she has averaged 11.9 points per game, trailing scoring leader sophomore Sarah Halejian, who nets an average of 13.9 points per game. Senior Megan Vasquez posted her career-high four rebounds against Harvard last Jan. 27 and rounds out the group with 8.8 points per game.“They try to use their quickness in the outside game against us,” Golen said. “I think we just need to focus on containing the drive as well as getting after the three point shots since they do have some pretty good shooters as well.”Similarly, a sharp-shooting backcourt runs the floor for the Bears (6-9, 1-1). Junior guard Lauren Clarke pulls in an average of 13.9 points while handing out three assists per game. Co-Captain Sheila Dixon notches 11.9 points and leads the effort on the glass, grabbing an average of five boards per game.“Even though neither one of [the two teams] have a tremendous non-conference record, they’re both extremely dangerous,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’ve played some good teams to close games and didn’t end up with the win. They’re similar – they’re athletic, they’re scrappy, they’re physical.”The Bulldogs and Brown have split match-ups with each other this season, with the Bears taking the first contest, 68-67, thanks to a buzzer-beater, but dropping the second, 59-47.In the second meeting of the two teams, Halejian posted her first career double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds.The Crimson will attempt to match its opponents’ athleticism with continued defensive pressure and finding an offensive rhythm.“[Against Dartmouth] I think we made a lot of errors by rush[ing] and hurry[ing] and the pressure kind of took us off guard and we played a little tight and timid,” Golen said. “Getting ready for this weekend we just have to be ready to face teams that are going to be in our face because we definitely have a ton on our back.”Christine Clark chipped in 22 points against the Big Green and was the only player from Harvard to record double-digit points in the contest. The junior guard has cracked double-digits in all but one game this season, breaking the 20-point mark in five match-ups.After putting up eight points and nabbing 10 rebounds, sophomore Temi Fagbenle received her sixth Ivy League Rookie of the Week award on Monday. The forward is the third leading scorer for the team with 11.3 points per game and was just short of a fourth career double-double this weekend.The Crimson was unable to connect from behind the arc last Saturday, drilling just one three out of 19 total attempts.While a rally at the end of the second half by Clark and Fagbenle pulled Harvard within six, Dartmouth, which shot just 30.8 percent for the contest, nailed 10 of 11 attempts from the charity stripe to seal the win.“Again, we’re just hoping to play more solid defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “I get that our emphasis has been on the defensive end and I was quite disappointed and shocked that offense was our trouble at Dartmouth. We found some solutions and hopefully we can keep stressing our defense.”—Staff writer Cordelia F. Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.havard.edu.

It's pretty clear whose hip hop posse ruled 2012. In September, Kanye West released the collaborative album ""Cruel Summer,"" which featured G.O.O.D. Music artists Big Sean, Common, and Pusha T as well as other friends like Jay-Z and 2 Chainz. G.O.O.D. Music dominated the airwaves with opulent beats and swaggering hubris. They forced us to pay attention not necessarily because the songs were groundbreaking but because the artists were elite.The calendar has turned, and a very different crew has emerged. This group has no throne on which to sit—they rely on craft rather than spectacle. On A$AP Rocky's ""1 Train,"" the ninth song on his new album ""Long.Live.A$AP,"" the rising Harlem star leads a staggering showcase of seven young and hungry rappers. ""I had to make the most perfect posse cut for 2013,"" A$AP Rocky said in a recent interview. ""1 Train"" might not be perfect, but it's a loud and confident fanfare for a new breed of lyricists.<!--more-->The beat is supplied by Hit-Boy, a producer who crashed on the scene with West and Jay-Z's epic ""Ni**as in Paris."" The subdued violin riff on ""1 Train"" doesn't come close to matching the grandeur of ""Paris,"" but the backbeat provides an easy groove for the rappers to ride.A$AP's first guest is Compton wunderkind Kendrick Lamar, fresh off of his enormously successful debut album, ""good kid, m.A.A.d City."" Known for being socially conscious, Lamar delivers a tension-filled, psychotic narrative of a man pushed to the brink by poverty and drugs. Next up is Brooklyn kid Joey Bada$$, who continues the same themes but trades Lamar’s intensity for wordplay: ""I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons / Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms / Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms.""
After a suspiciously derivative Yelawolf verse, A$AP puts back to back two rappers that could represent the contrasting drugs they reference in their lines. Detroit's Danny Brown emulates the highs and lows of molly: his voice high-pitched and abrasive, he crams references to penguins, solar system planets, ostriches, and Adonis into 16 bars. Alternatively, the laid-back Queens native Action Bronson is more akin to marijuana as he alternates between introspection and silly bravado: ""The moon's reflection off the lake hit me / You should have stayed with me / Now many Asian bitches lay with me.""By the time Big K.R.I.T. brings the song home with a long verse full of Southern swagger, it's hard not to imagine the kind of impact this posse will have in the coming years. Four of these seven released their major-label debuts last year, with two more scheduled to debut in 2013. Long gone are the days of East Coast-West Coast beefing; now, all the most talented young rappers from around the country hang out with, record with, and tweet at each other. The camaraderie may make for less drama, but it’s hard to argue with the cohesion and potential shown in ""1 Train.""Check out more Arts music coverage <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/tag/Music/"">here.

As of Monday evening, the Cambridge City Council continues to engage in a crucial <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/29/council-soda-ban/"">debate regarding a proposal to limit the size of sodas in the city. The policy in question has much in common with that of New York City’s Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s, which caps the size of sugary drinks to 16 ounces at movie theaters, restaurants, and mobile food carts. The Cambridge City Council is <a href=""http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cityClerk/PolicyOrder.cfm?item_id=35515"">aware of the rather significant health benefits of such a ban as well as the supposed infringement on individual liberties. The Harvard Crimson Staff encourages the City Council to support the soda size limit because it is a sensible public health policy that addresses the serious problem of obesity while curbing the ability of corporations to market extremely unhealthy goods at extremely low prices.It is widely acknowledged that the U.S. is one of the “heaviest” countries in the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html"">one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Furthermore, some of the leading causes of preventable death, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer, stem from obesity. A single 20-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola <a href=""http://productnutrition.thecoca-colacompany.com/products/coca-cola"">contains 65 grams of sugar—nearly twice as much as the daily<a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/363283-recommended-daily-allowance-of-sugar/""> recommended value for men by the American Heart Association. When it is so clear that there is an evident health risk that can be ameliorated by implementing a smaller container for sugary beverages, public health officials have a responsibility to the American public to do so. The question arises, however, as to whether they do in fact have the authority to make such a decision on behalf of citizens.Does the government have the authority to assign a standard number of seconds on crosswalk signals before individuals can walk? Does it have the authority to limit the amount of trans fat served in individual dishes at public restaurants? Or in Cambridge, is it justifiable that liquor stores cannot sell alcohol after 11 p.m.? Although these examples could all be considered limitations on individual autonomy, they highlight an overarching value system that prioritizes health and human life over the free market.Moreover and most crucially, it is a myth that consumer choice drives demand for harmful, heavily processed products; rather, predatory marketing, misguided agricultural policy, and a number of other factors jointly conspire to determine the foods that Americans eat. Government policy does not limit individual freedom any more than the free market already does, and it is the duty of local government to begin to shift the public climate and expose those parties who are responsible for America’s public health crisis. A large soda ban would not threaten individual liberties, but it would go a long way to limit corporate power.Although large soda bans are routinely mocked in popular culture, it is vitally important that we tackle an obesity epidemic that costs our nation billions of dollars each year. Policy reform at the local level is an important first step in doing so. We hope that the Cambridge City Council approves this proposal and paves the way for many more localities to follow suit.

As former President of Mexico Felipe Calderón arrives in Cambridge this week to begin a fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School, human rights activists and the School’s officials continue to engage in a back-and-forth over his appointment.Protesters argue that Calderón’s initiation of the drug wars in Mexico, which have resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, should disqualify him from the fellowship.A petition circulated on change.org by former U.S. border control officer John Randolph, protesting Calderón’s fellowship has accumulated over 35,000 signatures since the appointment was announced in late November.The petition’s authors delivered the petition to Kennedy School associate dean for communications and public affairs Melodie L. Jackson to discuss their grievances, according to a Kennedy School press release.Randolph wrote in an email to The Crimson that he has told the petition’s supporters that he would present the appeal to Harvard again if it receives its goal of 100,000 signatures.
Debate has also swelled in the Mexican intellectual community. El Colegio de México Professor Sergio Aguayo and poet Javier Sicilia appealed to Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, requesting a written explanation for Calderón’s appointment.“The unique opportunity to engage in direct discussion with a former head of state is one that many of our students value greatly, even if they may disagree with some of that leader’s policy positions,” Ellwood responded publicly.Thus far, Kennedy School statements have not addressed the drug wars specifically, but have defended the decision to name Calderón the inaugural Angelopoulos Fellow.“I am confident that Mr. Calderón’s one-year fellowship will create numerous opportunities for rigorous discussion and debate on a range of important issues between our students and Mexico’s former president,” Ellwood said in a statement.Government professor Steven R. Levitsky said that although he does not defend Calderón’s drug wars, “I just don’t think he’s a criminal.”“We should want to bring in people who generate criticism and debate. We should want to bring in people we disagree with—even vehemently so. That’s how we learn,” Levitsky said.Institutionally, Harvard has remained behind Calderón and there has been little public objection among students.One distinguished Harvard graduate has expressed disapproval, however.“I believe that the presence of Calderón at Harvard contradicts the values of representative democracy, critical thinking and intellectual and personal honesty the University promotes,” Mexican diplomat Hector Vasconcelos ’68 told Mexican news site Sin Embargo. Vasconcelos warned that he would return his Harvard degree should the Kennedy School uphold Calderón’s fellowship.—Staff writer Steven R. Watros can be reached at watros@college.harvard.edu.

Harvard has long been an underdog in competitive chess. More than a decade has passed since the Harvard Chess Club sent a team in contention for the Pan-American Intercollegiate Chess Championship title.But at last year’s Ivy League Chess Championship, Harvard did not even reach the podium; Columbia took first-place, Dartmouth finished second, and Yale and Princeton tied for third.Now, after a rewarding draw with Yale at the schools’ annual competition last fall, the team is preparing for a comeback at the 2013 Ivy League Chess Championship on Feb. 22, according to co-president Tony A. Blum ’14.Regardless of the outcome, the leaders of Harvard Chess are pushing to intensify the team’s tournament training in hopes of becoming more competitive nationally in the long run.STEEP COMPETITION
Harvard Chess last grabbed headlines in 2002, when it placed fourth at the Pan-American competition and gave chess giants University of Texas at Dallas and University of Maryland, Baltimore County a run for their money.While Harvard is now at the top of the Ivy League, on the national scene, the team faces steep competition from schools which recruit internationally.Currently, the Harvard chess club includes one master and five experts, expert, a rank one knotch before MasterAt University of Maryland, Baltmore, which offers full-scholarships to strong chess players, the chess team consists of two grand masters, two international masters, one women’s international grand master, and one master.“[Our success] basically boils down to the fact that we’ve invested so much money and resources to get top players from around the world,” said Richard Selzler, vice president of the UMBC Chess. “Our top players come from Georgia, Israel, [and] Russia.”Though Harvard Chess used to hold try outs to limit its membership, the team is now open to the Harvard and Cambridge communities, regardless of their experience.As part of the initiative to increase the team’s competitiveness on the national stage, the chess club co-presidents and vice-president hope to revamp practice to include more formalized training.WORK VERSUS PLAYOn Wednesday nights, club members camp out in the back of Quincy Dining Hall, lining a few tables with chess mats and clocks for timing.For the first 30 minutes, the area is quiet as players practice tournament-style play.

Students who enroll in most Harvard courses this spring will turn in assignments that will be viewed by just one or two instructors. But the students who take Chinese History 185 will produce work that will be used by thousands of online learners across the globe.Chinese History 185: “Creating ChinaX—Teaching China’s History Online” is a new Harvard class devoted to developing modules for ChinaX, an online class to be offered next fall through edX, the free not-for-profit online learning venture started by Harvard and MIT last May. ChinaX—which will be offered online through HarvardX, Harvard’s subset of the larger initiative—will delve into Chinese history and culture stretching from the 6th to the 18th century.On Wednesday, roughly 30 shoppers filed into a mortar-and-bricks Harvard classroom for the first Chinese History 185 class of the semester. Speaking to his prospective students, course head Peter K. Bol advertised the first-of-its-kind Harvard course as an opportunity for the students to creatively collaborate.“Together, you possess more knowledge than any of you do alone,” Bol, a professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, told the crowd of College students, graduate students, and visiting scholars in the room.For the next month, the students who enroll in Chinese History 185 will study an overview of China’s history through a curriculum that is a condensed version of Societies of the World 12: “China: Traditions and Transformations,” another course taught by Bol.
Students will then choose module topics and then work in teams to design maps and illustrations, assemble videos, select text and images for online discussion, and produce content structures.During class, students will assess each other’s modules and evaluate effective online teaching techniques. They will also attend lab once a week to learn how to edit video and create virtual illustrations.Ren Wei, a teaching fellow for the course, asked shoppers on Wednesday to consider the benefits and limitations of examining artwork on a computer screen, rather than in a traditional museum.By way of example, Wei said that while computers allow students to view inscriptions on an artistic chest in high definition, they restrict that persective to two dimensions.Kristen T. Faulkner ’15, who shopped Chinese History 185 on Wednesday, said she is looking forward to taking the class because she feels it meshes well with her existing academic interests.“I am in my third year of Chinese and a computer science concentrator, so I’m really excited about the technology side—and it deals with education too,” Faulkner said.—Staff writer Amna H. Hashmi can be reached at amnahashmi@college.harvard.edu.

Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 on Wednesday named William “Mo” Cowan, his former chief of staff and trusted aide, to serve as interim U.S. Senator for the next five months.Cowan will occupy the Senate seat resigned Tuesday by newly confirmed Secretary of State John F. Kerry until the seat is filled in a special election on June 25.Cowan, 43, was a partner at a Boston law firm and a former special prosecutor for the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office when he was recruited by Patrick to join the gubernatorial administration in 2009.After spending two years as the governor’s chief legal counsel, Cowan became Patrick’s chief of staff in January 2011, serving for another two years before departing last month.“Mo is a highly respected public citizen,” Patrick told reporters at a Wednesday press conference announcing the selection. “The people of the Commonwealth have benefitted from his wisdom and good judgment during his time in our office and will again in the Senate.”
The search for a replacement for Kerry, who had served in the Senate since 1985, began almost immediately after last November’s election. Kerry, who had travelled abroad for the Obama administration in a diplomatic capacity and had grown close to the president while playing the role of Mitt Romney in debate preparation, emerged as a contender for Secretary of State almost immediately.He was nominated in <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/21/kerry-seat-special-election/"">December and approved by the same leading Republicans who killed the candidacy of Susan E. Rice, ambassador to the United Nations. Rice had been the frontrunner for the post until she was derailed by criticism of her comments about the September 2012 attack on the U.S. embassy in  Bengazi, Libya.Since then, the hunt for a replacement in Massachusetts intensified, and so did the competition.The recently retired Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62 publicly <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/5/barney-frank-interim-senator/"">petitioned Patrick to consider him for the temporary seat, and the governor himself acknowledged that he received more than a few phone calls from interested parties. Some observers even called for Patrick to appoint himself.Cowan did not emerge as a leading candidate in the public eye until late in the game. Frank succeeded in generating early media attention with his public appeal, and many believed that Victoria R. Kennedy, the wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, was a frontrunner.Throughout the entire process, Patrick and his search committee remained tight-lipped.The night before the appointment, media outlets named Cowan and Kennedy as likely frontrunners, but even those who dared to make a prediction quickly acknowledged that Patrick could pull a name out of left field.It was not until just before Patrick’s scheduled press conference Wednesday that the selection was finally leaked in a report by the Boston Globe.Cowan, who will travel to Washington, D.C., by early next week, said he does not intend to use his five months on Capitol Hill as a springboard for future political ambitions.“This is going to be a very short political career,” he said. “I am not running for office, and I am not a candidate for public service anytime, today or in the future.”—Staff writer Matthew Q.

In the coming days, hundreds of Harvardians will “rush” one or more of the six Greek letter organizations already present on this campus. Additionally and for the first time in a decade, some of our peers will soon comprise the founding class of a Greek colony at Harvard, namely that of the Alpha Phi women’s fraternity. Although Harvard’s Greek scene is currently less prominent than those found at many of our peer institutions, the introduction of a fourth national women’s Greek organization to the College attests to the pronouncedly increased interest in Greek life seen lately at this institution. Despite this phenomenon, the Office of Student Life denies fraternities and sororities admission to the ranks of recognized student organizations and is thereby doing a disservice to both this community and to itself.Barring a propitious about-face, incoming Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde and his colleagues will almost certainly continue to refuse to recognize Harvard’s burgeoning Greek community for the foreseeable future. I presume that the rationale for doing so will be essentially tripartite; specifically, administrators will probably resist such recognition on the grounds that Greek life is regrettably sexist, ultimately nefarious, and fundamentally detrimental to so-called “House life.” None of these accusations is tenable, and the College would ultimately benefit from changing its position on this issue.Fraternities and sororities are, by definition, sexist; so is the Radcliffe Choral Society. Just as a women’s chorus can sound uniquely harmonious, so too can social organizations derive particular benefits from the exclusion of one sex. Rare is the one who would argue that a “girl’s night out” is a damaging pursuit, but many are of the mind that recognizing Greeks would make for a more misogynistic Harvard. This is a remarkably bizarre assertion, as sororities will soon outnumber fraternities on this campus; they already count three times as many sisters as our fraternities do brothers. I have heard many Harvard women speak glowingly of their sorority experiences and have yet to hear one remark about any misogyny on the part of a Harvard fraternity. If Greek life at Harvard is lamentably sexist in any way, then the evidence of this has been hidden remarkably well.Greek letter organizations are plagued by a host of negative connotations, many of which are understandable in light of tragedies and scandals both past and present. That said, I know not of any deplorable acts committed in recent memory by any fraternity or sorority at Harvard. In my experience, Crimson Greeks, particularly those who hold office in their respective organizations, are among the most involved and conscientious persons on this campus. It is unreasonable to presume that Greeks will be Greeks, if you will, especially in light of their well-established and admirable track record on this campus.To suggest that Greeks ought not to be recognized out of concerns that doing so would detract from or preclude the experience of living in one’s House presumes that the College’s residential system is actually effective in every case. It is not. While few students actually live off campus, many are far from floored about their “House community” and are eager for a more vibrant social life at Harvard (one need look no further than the many calls for new social spaces on campus to verify this assertion). The sisters and brothers whom I know find that their Greek involvement does not diminish but rather augments their enjoyment of their House, and a number of House Committee members are also Greeks. Our administrators’ long-held belief—dare I say, pipe dream—that the Houses somehow contain the solutions to all social problems at Harvard is both perplexing and deleterious, and there is no reason to believe that recognizing Greek life would set the Houses back in any way.
The Greek presence on this campus will inevitably continue to surge regardless of whether it is sanctioned any time soon. It is clear that fraternities and sororities confer benefits that many Harvardians desire, and when Harvard students know what they want, they will find it (or create it if they must). It would behoove our administration to recognize fraternities and sororities on this campus so that it might assist in ensuring that Greek life at Harvard benefits our community as much as it can.Samuel W.

In 1992, his penultimate year as Cincinnati’s football coach, current Harvard coach Tim Murphy led his Bearcats to a 3-8 finish. More than 20 years later, a trio of assistant coaches from that team is preparing to man the sidelines at Super Bowl XLVII, but at the time, Cincy assistants John Harbaugh, Jerry Rosburg, and Craig Ver Steeg hardly looked like hot coaching commodities.Harbaugh had just finished leading a special teams unit that finished 102nd out of 107 Division I teams in net punting. In his fifth year in the position, it seemed that Harbaugh’s football ascendancy had stalled for good after 10 years of coaching.Rosburg, who helped Harbaugh with special teams and guided a linebacker unit that was part of the 62nd-best total defense, was in a similar position. Ver Steeg coached the quarterbacks and wide receivers to the 62nd-ranked passing attack and admits that his career prospects seemed bleak before coming to the Bearcats.“I was looking for my first real opportunity back then,” Ver Steeg said. “I had been hanging on in college football. I was doing things like grad assistant, part-time guy, recruiting coordinator.… It’s hard, getting that first real shot to be a full-time coach.”The story of how they went from a mediocre mid-major conference college program to the biggest stage in American sports is a parable about the determination and lucky breaks necessary to make it in the football coaching world.
Harbaugh grew up the son of a football coach and, after playing defensive back at Miami (Ohio), started a football coaching career of his own. While his background is fairly standard for the industry, his career path to the Ravens was anything but typical.The coach got his start as a graduate assistant at Western Michigan and spent a year each at Pittsburgh and Morehead State. When Murphy left the University of Maine to take over in Cincinnati before the 1989 season, he asked Harbaugh to move once more.Over three years, Harbaugh had three jobs, moving up in responsibility each time. But he stayed with the Bearcats after the 1989 season; then 1990 came and went without a better job offer. Pretty soon it was 1993 Cincinnati’s 3-8 season, and he remained in the same position. Coach Harbaugh had spent five seasons in the Queen City with little to show for it.Harbaugh was frustrated and anxious that his rise might have reached its final destination. But looking back, the coach is thankful for his time under Murphy.“There never has been a guy that I’ve been around who works harder, that is more detailed and covers every base,” Harbaugh said. “I think that was one of the biggest things that you learned as a young coach from ‘Murph’—that you were going to have to have all t’s crossed and the i’s dotted. As a young coach, that’s a great lesson to have. Plus, he was just an incredible friend, a guy who cares about players and cares about coaches. That’s important.”Murphy’s wisdom might have been valuable, but ultimately it was his departure that sparked the renaissance of Harbaugh’s career. Due in part to the vacancies left when Murphy went to Harvard, Harbaugh was promoted to assistant head coach.After two years as assistant head coach, Harbaugh got a job at Indiana University in the Big Ten, one of college football’s premier conferences. It took just one season there to catch the eye of the NFL’s Philadelphia Eagles, who hired Harbaugh to be their special teams coordinator.The NFL coaching structure takes a completely different shape from its college counterpart. With fewer jobs and a plethora of quality candidates, keeping your job becomes the priority, with promotions coming as bonuses. For nine years, Harbaugh coached special teams in Philadelphia. In 2007, he moved within the organization to take charge of the secondary unit.A year later, Harbaugh got an interview with the Ravens as they searched for a new head coach following the firing of Brian Billick. Baltimore decided to give him the head gig.“I can’t tell you I thought he’d be an NFL head coach, but I’ll tell you one thing, he was a tremendous coach,” Murphy said. “He was a tremendously charismatic, impressive coach from the standpoint of his work ethic, his attention to detail, and ultimately what he got out of his players.”

Over winter break, I was arrested with seven other students for <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/massachusetts/2013/01/07/protesters-glue-themselves-together-westborough-office-company-building-pipeline/3MkxHkv9gbokZbTIQ4vkkO/story.html"">staging a lock-in at the Westborough, Mass. office of the TransCanada Corporation in protest of the Keystone XL pipeline. Bound together with chains, sitting beneath the corporation’s logo and the American flag, we made the point that TransCanada is locking our generation into irreversible climate disaster by pushing forward new fossil fuel infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline.Growing up, I never expected to be arrested for civil disobedience, but today I find myself and my generation in a desperate situation. We are living in a time of great crisis—the climate crisis. The World Bank recently published a <a href=""http://climatechange.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/Turn_Down_the_heat_Why_a_4_degree_centrigrade_warmer_world_must_be_avoided.pdf"">report announcing that we are on track to warm the planet up by four degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The report details predictions of intense heat waves, widespread water shortages, massive wildfires, and the disruption of livelihoods around the world. These alarming details, however, are overshadowed by the authors’ terrifying statement that “there is no certainty that adaptation to a 4°C world would be possible.”We may not be able to adapt to global warming. The basis of our civilization could fall out from under our feet within our lifetimes. Everything we have ever worked for—all the cities, the families, the art, the science—could be lost.Unfortunately, the unbendable rules of chemistry and physics have set a very narrow timeframe for action against the climate crisis. After humans have warmed the planet up a certain amount, we will cross a natural “tipping point,” such as the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/14/arctic-permafrost-methane"">melting of the arctic tundra and the accompanying release of potent greenhouse gases locked under its surface. After these tipping points, the Earth will begin to warm itself, and any success we have in lowering our own greenhouse gas emissions will not stop the warming. No one knows exactly when the tipping points will arrive, but the International Energy Agency has <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/09/fossil-fuel-infrastructure-climate-change"">projected that we will be “locked in” to irreversible climate change in four years because of our continued construction of fossil fuel infrastructure.Rage boils up inside of me when I look at these numbers because the world did not need to let things go this close to the edge. Scientists have been calling for action for more years than I have been alive, yet our government has failed to act. The costs of inaction grow each day, as the timeframe left to transition to renewables shortens and the impacts of climate change, from last summer’s droughts in the Midwest to Superstorm Sandy, start to <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/11/27/1244021/cost-of-superstorm-sandy-and-other-2012-extreme-weather-events-on-the-rise/"">take their toll. Even today, our government has failed to act with enough resolve to really solve the problem. Its failure is inexcusable.
If our government will not stop these corporations on the basis of strong scientific and economic arguments, then we must produce the political will to stop them through our actions. The traditional methods of political mobilization—rallies, lobbying, even opinion polls that show <a href=""http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Political-Benefits-Pro-Climate-Stand-2013.pdf"">88 percent support for government action on climate change—have failed to overcome the stranglehold that fossil fuel corporations have on our government. Civil disobedience has thus become a logical and necessary next step for the increasingly powerful and desperate climate movement.Our action in Westborough was not an anomaly but rather an addition to a growing nationwide narrative as more and more people turn to civil disobedience to stop the climate crisis. Over 1,200 activists were <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-mckibben/white-house-tar-sands-sit_b_947965.html#s349524&amp;title=No_Tar_Sands"">arrested for a sit-in against Keystone XL outside the White House, while dozens of Texan activists have taken courageous direct <a href=""http://tarsandsblockade.org/"">action to prevent and delay construction of the pipeline’s southern leg. Coal mines, natural gas fracking wells, and other fossil fuel infrastructure projects are becoming hotbeds for civil disobedience, as are the offices of the decision-makers who irresponsibly let the projects proceed. In a sign of the times, the Sierra Club recently made the first <a href=""http://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2013/01/sierra-club-engage-civil-disobedience-first-time-organizations-history"">exception in 120 years to its policy against civil disobedience.By putting our bodies on the line in acts of peaceful civil disobedience, we are making the ultimate moral statement. The message sent by our sacrifices will reverberate through society until the corporations give up or the government finally finds the political will to stop them.The task of transitioning to renewable energy may look daunting, but as our acts of civil disobedience make clear, our commitment to survival is non-negotiable.

“How do you like the bounty hunting business?”“Kill white people and get paid for it? What’s not to like?”I burst out laughing, and I could hear others around me giggling too. As a film fanatic, I had dragged my friend to a screening of the new Tarantino film “Django Unchained” on the day it opened in my city. An hour in, I was laughing inconsolably at the barrage of cleverly written dry witticisms of Christoph Waltz and deadpan one-liners of Jamie Foxx. At a certain point, members of the audience cheered and clapped when Django, a newly freed slave, mercilessly whipped a cruel slave overseer to an inch of his life before planting a bullet in his head. It seemed that yet another one of Tarantino’s violently comical motion pictures had succeeded in satisfying an audience.But the energy quickly vanished from the cinema as the film took a much darker turn. A runaway slave getting ripped apart alive by hunting dogs, a “Mandingo fighter” punching the teeth out of another before pummeling him to death, a woman’s face being branded. I could not bring myself to watch, and I could tell that everyone else was horrified yet mesmerized by the brutality on screen. But soon the audience’s attention was turned away from the film and toward a pair of young men behind me, who were laughing sadistically, maniacally, and uncontrollably during these horrific scenes.I was in a complete state of shock. My friend and I looked at each other in confusion. Who could find such a vivid account of the very real, appalling treatment of human beings during a dark chapter in America’s history so funny? An uncomfortable tension filled the cinema. The laughing went on for the next hour in the otherwise dead silence.
Finally, someone spoke.“You’re laughing a little too loud.”The laughing stopped.As I left the theatre, I could not help but feel overwhelming feelings of guilt. Yes, those men sitting behind me had a perverse sense of humor, but how was I any different? I walked into the theatre fully aware of the horrors of slavery. I had just finished two chapters on slavery in “A People’s History of the United States” by Howard Zinn. The film even opened with five miserable slaves shackled together, forced to walk through the cold barefoot. Yet I still laughed at the film’s jokes using the “n” word and a hilarious scene involving white supremacists. Am I just as ignorant as those two men because I treated such a serious subject so lightly? Am I guilty of being a sheltered armchair historian who whitewashes the abominable truth? And, out of all people, did it really have to take Quentin Tarantino himself to make me realize how little I appreciate the realities behind words I had skimmed over in a book?Regardless of whether you equate me with the men who sat behind me, one thing is certain. The lines between history and fiction often blur as time goes by. We must watch historical films, whether humorous or not, with the ability to appreciate the entertainment provided by expert filmmaking while simultaneously respecting the truth. That is the power of films like “Django Unchained.” These films remind us of the horrors that we, as 21st century upstarts who stand on the shoulders of the giants of history, often fail to appreciate. I was more emotionally affected by the depiction of slaves being whipped in “Django Unchained” than by the countless readings on the treatment of slaves for the British Empire class I took last semester.That was my “<a href=""http://gawker.com/5971346/the-django-moment-or-when-should-white-people-laugh-in-django-unchained"">Django Moment”: the point I realized that I should never have to rely on a film to alert me of my false way of studying history and observing current events. “Django” brilliantly politicizes Tarantino’s usual comic violence. It hits closer to the bone because, unlike in his other films, the recipients of violence are not comical villains or unsympathetic heroes. Rather, they are slaves. They are people who actually suffered in the way that is portrayed on screen. But it should not have to take a Tarantino film to serve as a wake-up call. Next time you skim a news item or a reading for class, take a moment to appreciate the knowledge you have gained rather than just quickly absorbing it so you can whip out some brilliant anecdote during section.Next time I have a moment of self-realization, I hope I won’t be covering my eyes while listening to the sounds of hunting dogs and depraved laughter. And I hope your “Django Moment” will be a little less graphic too.Heather L. Pickerell ’15, a Crimson editorial executive, is a social studies concentrator in Mather House.

Harvard Law School’s first ever online course launched Monday, opening up “Copyright,” a class taught by Law School professor William W. Fisher, III, to hundreds of people worldwide.HLS1x: “Copyright,” which is offered through the Harvard branch of the online learning platform edX, is closely modeled after the Law School course taught by Fisher since 1994.According to Fisher, 4,100 people applied to take “Copyright,” which is the first and only edX class to have a fixed enrollment. Fisher and his teaching fellows selected 500 students for the 12-week course.When choosing students, Fisher said, he looked for candidates with ”a certain minimum level of English competence and intelligence.”“Past that, the process was not like the admissions at a place like Harvard,” Fisher said.
“We were looking for commitment, people who would be engaged and follow through, and diversity in many dimensions, including profession, age, field and geography. We got it,” he added.Enrollees range in occupation from high school students to professional lawyers.Fisher said that many of the enrolled students have no formal legal background but work in fields such as music or journalism that touch upon copyright issuesFor the online course, Fisher will post 12 pre-recorded lectures, which he described as “not dumbed down at all” from those he gives at the Law School.In live seminars conducted by video chat, 25 students will discuss the material with a teaching fellow who either has already taken or is currently enrolled in the in-person version of the course taught at Harvard.Fisher is also hosting six webcast events with outside speakers.Half of the students enrolled in “Copyright” will study case-law drawn primarily from the United States and the other half will take a global curriculum that uses sources from around the world.Fisher said he thinks that copyright law, which he views as economically and socially significant, particularly suits the format of an online course “because of its readily grasped cultural importance.”If this course runs effectively, Fisher said that he expects Harvard to offer more law courses through edX in the future.Several professors at the Law School have already approached him about starting their own online courses sometime next year, he said.“My hope is in this course to test and refine some constructive types of information technology and try to avoid malign deployments of information technology in teaching,” Fisher said.—Staff writer Dev A.

February 2 through March 17American Repertory Theater Three interconnecting hexagonal shapes are taped out on the rehearsal room floor for John Tiffany’s upcoming production of Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie,” which opens at the American Repertory Theater on Saturday. These shapes are the outlines for a pared-down version of the Wingfield apartment, where the whole action of the play will unfold. “The Glass Menagerie” follows Tom Wingfield (Zachary Quinto), a restless twenty-something who yearns to escape the claustrophobic setting of his childhood home. “It’s pure theater, what Tennessee Williams envisaged,” Tiffany says.  
With movement choreographed by Tiffany’s long-time collaborator Steven Hoggett and original music composed by Nico Muhly, “The Glass Menagerie” adds new artistic components to the classic play. These additions, along with the sparse set design by Tony Award-winning Bob Crowley, represent a reimagined view of the story line. Traditionally the play takes place in a claustrophobic apartment, but Crowley has chosen to remove the walls and make the set more open to the audience. Although best known as a director of new works such as “Black Watch” and “Once,” which now plays on Broadway, directing the Williams classic is something Tiffany has yearned for since his student days. The play has long been one of the director’s favorites, he says. When he was a Radcliffe Fellow in 2011, he met Cherry Jones, a founding member of ART and an actress best known for her role in the television series “24” and her Tony Award-winning performance in the play “Doubt.”  Tiffany recalls the lunch with Jones when he first realized she would be the perfect Amanda Wingfield, Tom’s overbearing and controlling mother in “The Glass Menagerie.” “It took a while to convince her to do it,” he says. “She didn’t think it was a part that she’d ever blossom in.” But Tiffany says Jones’ reservations were quelled by the gathering of the cast 14 months ago for a read-through of the play.  “Everyone came to it really hungry and excited to be in Cambridge,” Tiffany says.  Despite the new design aspects of the production, Tiffany asserts that the classic text remains the focus of the piece.  “I’ve been asked quite a few times, ‘Is this a radical reworking of ‘The Glass Menagerie?’’” Tiffany says. “If it is, it doesn’t feel like we’re intending to do that.”  —Staff writer Joshua R.

Though scaffolding and black tarp continue to shroud the facade of Old Quincy, renovations on the building are proceeding according to plan.“At the end of December, the Old Quincy Test Project approached 50 percent completion and continues to track on schedule and budget,” Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an email statement.Although the Neo-Georgian exterior remains intact, the inside of Old Quincy has been gutted and the entire layout has been remodeled.“Interior wall framing and the rough-in installation of the electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems has been completed in the upper floors of the building and is progressing down through the lower levels,” Neal wrote.According to Neal, structural modifications to the lower level are expected to be finished by the end of January.
Neal wrote that administrators view the renovations of Quincy House a “test project” because it will provide key information that may influence the renewal process for the rest of the Houses.Construction on Old Leverett is slated to begin in June of 2013, followed by Dunster in the summer of 2014.A sign posted outside of Quincy’s main entrance provides students with a weekly update about the progress of construction.Students displaced by the renovations on Old Quincy are currently being housed in three Harvard-owned apartment buildings across the Square. Despite the relocations, many students said that construction has not posed a significant disruption to student life.Daniel Sung ’15, a Quincy resident currently living in Hampden Hall on Plympton St., said he feels that swing housing is “amazing.”“We get the best,” Sung said, referring to the fact that next year, sophomores will occupy the renovated Old Quincy complete with updated living accomodations.Alexis J. Smith ’15, who is also living in swing housing, echoed Sung’s sentiment.“I’m not really exposed to a lot of the noise or construction,” Smith said. “I don’t have any negative feelings about it.”Smith said she appreciates the efforts of the University to revamp the Houses.“It shows the housing system moving in a modern direction,” she said.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Elizabeth S.

Former U.S. Senator Scott Brown will not run in the special election for John F. Kerry's vacated senate seat, according to a report Friday by the Associated Press.The Republican Brown—who lost his seat in November to former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren—was seen as a favorite to contend for Kerry's seat, which was opened when the 28-year Senate veteran was appointed Secretary of State.<!--more--> Preliminary polls showed Brown with a comfortable lead over both of his potential Democratic opponents, Fifth District Congressman Edward J. Markey and Eighth District Congressman Stephen F. Lynch, in the special election slated for June 25.But Brown would have faced some risk had he chosen to run. A loss would have been his second statewide defeat in less than a year, a setback that likely would have ended his political career, according to politically connected experts.
 With Brown out of the running, many have speculated that the Massachusetts Republican Party will turn to former Gov. William F. Weld ’66 as its candidate for the seat. Weld could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.

In a moment that decided the fate of nations, Siyavush and Afrasiyab—two characters in the Persian epic poem “The Shahnameh”—put aside their differences and embraced like brothers.“This piece is one of my favorites,” says exhibit curator Mary McWilliams, while looking at a depiction of this scene in an illuminated manuscript now on display in the Sackler Museum.“It is a moment of reconciliation, a moment of harmony between these ancient enemies. They really are choosing the more difficult right over the easier wrong,” McWilliams says.The miniature painting is one of the centerpieces of “In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art,” a new exhibit that presents art created in what scholars now call Greater Iran—an area of Persian cultural influence that stretched from modern day Iraq to Central Asia throughout the Middle Ages.“In Harmony,” which opened on Monday and will remain on display until June 1, consists of the collection of Norma Jean Calderwood, a private art collector, curator, and former fine arts lecturer Boston College, who amassed an extensive array of Islamic art over the course of her life.
McWilliams says she aimed to display the works of art while still paying homage to the woman who collected them, such as by curating the collection based on Calderwood’s own interests and strategies.“She gave a lot of public lectures and museum training at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston,” McWilliams says. “I have mined those texts to try and understand her thinking.”To make sense of the eclectic collection, McWilliams organized most of the works in chronological order by the date of production, while she grouped others in clusters to highlight certain themes.One display case contains ceramics from different time periods that all use images of birds. Another wall explores the development of miniature paintings from Shiraz, Iran. The result highlights the similarity in content across different mediums while still exploring the evolution in taste and style throughout medieval Iranian history.To provide additional information, the museum made use of Layar technology, an iOS and Android app, to make a guide specifically for this exhibit. Viewers can access supplementary digital materials by scanning an item in the exhibit using their mobile devices.The exhibit was made possible by a 2002 donation from Calderwood’s husband, Stanford Calderwood, a businessman and arts patron shortly before they both passed away. McWilliams said that Stanford Calderwood donated the collection in the hopes of conveying “the full scope” of his wife’s lifetime achievement.“He gave this with really only two conditions: that we name the collection after his wife, and that we publish the entire collection,” McWilliams says.In a lecture to Boston College students given in 1994, Calderwood described Persian miniature painting as a complex art form that combined disparate elements to form a cohesive whole.“The compositions are a combination of visual types, all united to form a harmony, with patterns of line and color covering the whole surface of the picture space,” Calderwood said.Despite the tangible influence of their collector, McWilliams says the pieces themselves are ultimately the focus of the exhibition.“One other condition that Stan Calderwood put on the gift was that the catalogue and the exhibition would not be about Norma Jean herself. He wanted it to be about the art,” she says.—Staff writer Noah S. Guiney can be reached at nguiney@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: February 5, 2013, at 6:08 a.m.Roughly 70 students, or approximately one percent of Harvard’s undergraduate body, were forced to temporarily withdraw from the College last fall in connection with the massive Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard indicated in an announcement Friday morning.In an email sent to the Harvard community, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote that “somewhat more than half” of the cases heard by the College’s Administrative Board last fall resulted in forced withdrawals. He did not specify exactly how many students were required to leave.Smith also wrote that about half of the fall’s remaining cases resulted in disciplinary probation, while the rest resulted in no disciplinary action.About 125 of the cases heard by the Ad Board last fall were those of students implicated in the scandal, which was unearthed after assistant professor Matthew B. Platt reported suspicious similarities on a handful of take-home exams in his spring course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
After this initial tip-off, the College launched an investigation that eventually expanded to involve almost half of the 279 students enrolled in the course.Smith also revealed details about how tuition payments will be calculated for students who were required to withdraw mid-fall semester due to their involvement in the scandal.Due to a prolonged time frame for the resolution of the cases stretching from late September to December that “had an undesirable interaction with our established schedule for tuition refunds,” the College will adjust tuition charges for all students who eventually withdrew as though they were issued their verdicts on Sept. 30, he wrote.According to <a href=""http://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k88702&amp;pageid=icb.page516345"">the student handbook, a student who involuntarily or voluntarily withdraws from the College on Sept. 30 must pay $4,697 in tuition, as well as per diem room charges, pro-rated board costs, and a student services fee.Smith’s email, which represents Harvard’s first substantive announcement about the investigation’s status since it was first announced last August, comes in the midst of harsh criticism of Harvard’s handling of the case from several longtime Harvard insiders.Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 voiced his disapproval in several blog posts, and prominent men’s basketball supporter and Staples founder Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 excoriated his alma mater for its response to the scandal in a letter of complaint sent to University President Drew G. Faust last month.Smith’s email repeatedly alluded to these and other criticisms, at times striking a defensive tone in addressing the amount of time the University took to resolve the cases, concerns about faculty teaching, and the public outing of some accused students.After both Lewis and Stemberg criticized Harvard for failing to hand out verdicts in a timely manner, Smith attributed the slow turnover of the investigation—which began in the summer but did not wrap up until early December—to “the unprecedented number and complexity of cases.”Critics of the investigation have also drawn attention to the way Platt organized Government 1310, a factor which both Stemberg and Lewis blamed for the unprecedented scope of the scandal.“We had a professor who, like many the Faculty of Arts and Sciences assigns to teach undergraduates, was clearly not qualified to do so,” Stemberg <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/25/letter-stemberg-cheating-scandal/"">wrote in his letter to Faust, which was dated Jan. 6.

UPDATED: February 1, 2013, at 11:25 p.m.Harvard’s administrative structure has come under fire for being overly bureaucratic. But for one Chinese university president, it offers a model for progress.Speaking to an audience in CGIS Thursday afternoon, Chongqing University President Lin Jianhua argued that an outdated educational model that places too little emphasis on teaching has stunted the progress of Chinese higher education.Lin, who as the leader of Chongqing University oversees one of China’s top-ranked educational institutions, said he believes that Chinese universities pay too much attention to research and too little to their students.“China has grown economically, and higher education has also dramatically increased for the past couple of years,” Lin said at the start of his talk. “But we are also facing a very serious problem.”
In his talk, which was sponsored by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, Lin also criticized China’s secondary school system for teaching a curriculum that he said does no more than prepare students for a single entrance examination.“Values, ethics, responsibility, social services, and practices are ignored in education,” Lin said. “They are not considered important.”Also problematic, according to Lin, is the obsolete nature of the Chinese system. Lin said China’s current model was initially adopted from the former Soviet Union education system, which emphasized efficiency at the expense of individuality.“The university generates mass graduates just like in an assembly line,” he said.In his effort to address these problems, Lin called on China to transform its system immediately.“We shouldn’t miss the boat,” Lin said. “The whole society is calling for reform of higher education. Now is the time.”To fix these issues at his own university, Lin said he is establishing two new enhanced engineering programs, a tenure system, and a visiting scholars program.He is also recruiting two new deans from Hong Kong and the United States and is looking to create an administrative structure similar to Harvard’s.In response to questions about the feasibility of his plan, Lin emphasized the difficulty of reform.“Whenever you do a new thing in China, you must be realistic to adapt to the system we have now,” Lin said. “You can’t do everything new. That simply doesn’t work.”Audience members interviewed after the event voiced doubt about how far Lin’s reforms could go in repairing a broken system.“There are so many challenges,” said Joseph You Guo Jiang, an independent scholar affiliated with the Fairbank Center. “[In China], they do not focus on the whole, the well-rounded student. It’s tough. I don’t see a big change happening in the next 20 years.”—Staff writer Pooja Podugu can be reached at podugu@college.harvard.edu.

As Joseph K. Blitzstein took to the stage of Sanders Theatre Thursday evening for the fourth annual “Harvard Thinks Big,” he was greeted by wolf-whistles and cardboard signs emblazoned with his name. Firing the audience up was the anticipation of a 12-minute speech on how all probability is conditional, laced with humor and data.Blitzstein, a professor of the practice in statistics, set the tone for an evening of “big ideas” that brought together both the comedic and existential natures of some of Harvard’s top academics. Speaking on topics ranging from Romans to breast milk, six faculty members and Harvard Thinks Big’s first student speaker had a packed crowd, alternatively roaring with laughter and questioning conditions of humanity.Katherine J. Hinde, assistant professor of Human Evolutionary Biology, began by promising to explain why “mammals suck way better.” She proceeded to outline the advantages of breast milk, ultimately calling for greater research and societal infrastructure to give mothers the choice of breastfeeding.Classics and history professor Emma Dench took a more interactive approach and asked her spectators to repeat the age-old dictum, “Latin is a language as dead as dead can be/It killed off all the Romans and now it’s killing me.”She then explored the implications for modern citizens of studying a civilization as distant and complex as Rome—one that created democracy and took fun out of dancing dwarves.
“You begin to see the gaps in logic, the blind spots in our own society,” said Dench said.Some of the speakers were more contemplative, including Annemarie E. Ryu ’13, who concentrates in Anthropology. She cited many of her ventures, including work she has done to promote the sale of jackfruit in the global market, to urge her audience to “Think big,” and “Act now, not later.”Professor of Romance Languages and Literature and of African and African American Studies Doris Sommer argued that “culture changes the world.”She gave the startling example of Antanas Mockus, former mayor of Bogotá, Columbia, who managed to curb traffic deaths by replacing corrupt police with pantomime artists.“Without pleasure, there is no lasting cultural change, no lasting political change,” she said.Roberto M. Unger, professor of law, implored humans to delegate more tasks to machines to preserve their most precious resource: time.Concluding the event with a fervent call to action was Michael Puett, professor of Chinese history. Claiming that his generation mistakenly thought it had “figured things out” after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Puett entreated students to move beyond traditional modes of thinking.“We have left you with a very foolishly complacent way of thinking about the world,” Puett said. “But the world we left you with—bad as it is—can still be saved.”Audience members had a chance to reflect on the event in real time throughout the night, tweeting comments tagged #htb4 that were flashed onscreen between speakers. Students said they enjoyed the evening’s diversity of perspectives.“We tend to have small academic niches here,” said Abigail E. Hook ’13. “This was a great way to broaden our perspectives from professors I never would have taken a class from.”—Staff writer Anneli L. Tostar can be reached at annelitostar@college.harvard.edu.

As politicians continue to debate the scope of gun control in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, one Harvard faculty member is suggesting that more funds be dedicated to researching the effects of gun violence on public health.David Hemenway ’66, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health and a lead researcher in the field of gun control, has been investigating the issue of gun violence for years. His studies suggest that gun violence in this country is caused by more than just simple legislative faults and that its regulation requires changing both public policy and social norms.“A good approach to try to reduce our gun violence problem is the public health approach, which focuses on prevention and really emphasizes that you don’t have to wait till someone’s pulling the trigger to try to do something about that person,” Hemenway said. His recommendations include bolstering background checks and reinforcing serial numbers on firearms.And although the Newtown tragedy has ignited recent media exposure, researchers like Hemenway have been debating the issue for years.“We have a terrible gun problem,” Hemenway said. “In terms of violence, other than gun violence, we’re an average country­...but we have lots more guns and by far the weakest gun laws.”
Studies say that the United States has one of the highest levels of gun related violence in the world.Prioritizing prevention can be best achieved when new policies are integrated with efforts to understand the social and cultural determinants of gun violence, according to Hemenway. Still, he added that the allocation of funds for research remains inadequate, making it difficult to collect data on the subject.Hemenway’s sentiment was echoed in a recent article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association entitled “Silencing the Science on Gun Research.”“It’s very, very sad when vested interests try to prevent research and science,” Hemenway said. “It’s almost impossible to get funding to do this research.”Hemenway stressed its urgency.“If not now, when?” he asked.  “How many people have to die before the society steps up?”—Staff writer Fatima Mirza can be reached at fmirza@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Rachel J. Sapire can be reached at rsapire@college.harvard.edu.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 1, 2013<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated and included a headline indicating that Harvard School of Public Health professor David Hemenway ’66 discussed his research at a talk at HSPH on Thursday. In fact, he spoke about gun violence in a Thursday interview with The Crimson.

It’s the usual mid-semester day. I’m rushing to make my afternoon class by Harvard time. And from afar we greet each other with a quick wave. As we’re about to cross paths, that question comes. The question that holds so much potential, that could mean so much.“How are you?”To you it’s nothing more than a half-hearted handshake. And I treat it as the same.“I’m fine,” I say.But you don’t see how my strained smile doesn’t reach my eyes. You don’t because you can’t. You can’t because you’re like me: so caught up with how things look on the outside, we don’t know how to look inward.
I’m not fine. Neither are you. But it’s easier to pretend we are. We convince ourselves that we’re having a meaningful conversation as we lament the all-nighters needed for the two ten-page papers due this week. We think we’re bonding as we flip through notes for answers to tomorrow’s problem set. And we think we know each other as we covertly boast about that research program we have lined up for summer.But I don’t tell you that the real reason I’m losing sleep is because I worry about<span style=""color: #ff0000;""><span style=""text-decoration: line-through;""> how my parents will afford tuition for next semester. I don’t say that the reason I’ll be here this summer is that there’s no place I truly feel at home.As Harvard students, we feel that we’re supposed to have everything together. Weaving through tourists in Harvard Yard, sometimes it almost feels like we’re on display. So we feel as though we have to put all of our efforts into the upkeep of a façade of perpetual success. But what is a beautiful house that is shambles inside?We give greater regard to outside recognition than to inward fulfillment. We are devastated when we end up with a B on that midterm we studied so hard for.  We feel hopeless when we don’t get accepted into that analyst internship we were vying for. And we’ve come to define our time here as a necessary experience to reach the next rung of the success ladder.But what are we climbing up to? And when we get there, will we finally be happy?The problem is that we don’t take the time to truly ask ourselves: Am I really fine? We’ve somehow come to convince ourselves that by being successful, we will be happy. But what do we see as success?  Is it an A on that midterm? Is it acceptance into that summer internship? But why then do we still feel like we’re not good enough? Why do we still feel like we’re at the point of our feet slipping, still reaching?Maybe it’s because happiness isn’t about scores, marks, certificates, or the next prestigious award. Maybe it’s because happiness is about how we feel about ourselves. <del> </del>And maybe we find it so hard to grasp happiness because self-worth can’t be quantified. Self-worth can’t give a GPA or resume boost, so we don’t give it the time of day. We’re used to quantifying the worth of our lives by our achievements. But in doing so, we often forget that we have the power to define what an achievement means to us.An accomplishment doesn’t always need to be academic. We can feel accomplished by simply attending classes for the day. We can feel accomplished after coming back from hard tennis practice. We can feel accomplished by finally having dinner with a friend we haven’t seen in a few weeks. In building self-worth, we can’t always wait for other people to congratulate us. We need to learn to do that for ourselves.When we learn to congratulate ourselves, we learn to truly believe in ourselves. We believe in ourselves not because someone or something else is allowing us to, but because we are allowing ourselves to.<span style=""color: #ff0000;""><span style=""text-decoration: line-through;""> We must place our self-fulfillment first and outside accolades second.In an environment that is so widely recognized as a bastion of high achievement and success, we have to ask ourselves what success means. These classes, internships, and prestigious positions we strive for are simply moments, points along a greater journey. College is a significant path in the greater journey that is our lives. And in our time here, we owe it to ourselves to look beyond academics to how we view ourselves. It is not accolades that determine how much potential we hold. That power comes from within.We don’t need to be near perfect to have potential. We can admit that sometimes we’re having a bad week. We can admit that we have personal struggles—with family, friends, or even ourselves. We can admit that we need help.We can admit that we’re not fine because we don’t always have to be. When we do, we can begin to find true happiness.Nzuekoh N. Nchinda ’14, a Crimson arts writer, is a chemistry concentrator in Kirkland House.

Harvard Thinks Big rang in its fourth year on Thursday, featuring seven celebrity/professor speakers with 12 minutes each to present the next—you guessed it—big idea. Although Drew Faust couldn't make it (allegations were made that she was off in LA lobbying the Academy of Motion Pictures for Lincoln), people still packed into Sanders Theatre to attend the event, one of Harvard's newest traditions.In case you missed it, here is our tl;dr version of the two hour event.<!--more-->Joseph K. Blitzstein: ""The Soul of Statistics""Professor of the practice of statisticsIn 1865, a chocolate maker's longevity was 73.6. A professor's was 66.6 and a student's was 20.2. What this tells us is that chocolate is always the answer, conditioning is the soul of statistics, and without regression towards the mean, the world would be filled with 10 feet giants and 4 inch people.
Doris Sommer: ""Cultural Agents All""Ira Jewell William Professor of Romance Language and Literatures, Professor of African and African American StudiesAccording to Kant, art can communicate that which doesn't have a name yet. That somehow involves the mayor of Bogota replacing cops with pantomimes to direct traffic, which actually correlated with a decline in traffic accidents and homicide rates. Apparently, the shock value of clowns, and public art, reaches across nations.Katherine J. Hinde: ""Why Mammals Suck""Assistant professor of Human Evolutionary BiologyMammals suck (milk) way better. Milk is a magic potion, and is literally filled everything and anything an infant will need. It can prevent obesity, save up to 1.5 million deaths from diarrhea by contributing healthy gut bacteria, save premature babies—essentially everything short of curdling when in contact with lemon.Roberto M. Unger: ""No One Should Have to Do Work That Can Be Done by a Machine""Roscoe Pound Professor of LawUnger envisions a world where machines do everything that we can repeat, so we can preserve our supreme resource of time, to focus on what we cannot repeat. And when that happens, we shall achieve what we all desire, which is to die only once. Can you feel the chilling grip of dystopia?Emma Dench: ""Talking to Dead People""

It’s difficult for a stage adaptation of a celebrated novel to become considered a great work in its own right, but the new adaption of “Invisible Man” effectively transforms Ralph Ellison's classic novel into an even more meaningful production. ""Invisible Man"" premiered in Chicago as the first adaption of the novel, the script written by Oren Jacoby. Now playing at the Boston University Theater through February 3, Huntington Theatre's production comes to new life through the unforgettably poignant performances of the actors, expressive, subtle direction by Christopher McElroen, and inventive lighting design that changes setting as quickly as the nameless narrator jumps from one memory to the next. The success of the performance rests on the shoulders of Teagle F. Bougere, who plays the nameless narrator through whose memories the audience comes to understand the universal yearning for escape from societal invisibility. Ellison’s novel is told from an unspecified basement in New York City; thus, Bougere is alone on stage for a good portion of the show and must carry much of the momentum as the story progresses. At times Bougere appears to be two different characters—he acts as both protagonist and antagonist of his own story and alternates between arm-waving passion and seated resignation, a man with too much to say and not enough people willing to listen. One of the most moving parts of Bougere’s performance is when his character gives a eulogy at the funeral of his friend, Tod Clifton (De’Lon Grant). This hair-raising speech shows the invisible man’s transformation from a naïve child to a disillusioned adult all in the space of three and a half minutes. As Bougere repeatedly shouts, “He’s dead,” first with anger and then through tears, his story comes alive. Though in the novel this monologue comes across primarily as  a political statement, Bougere’s performance turns the speech into a personal one. Bougere makes the character of the narrator especially relatable by using his speech almost instrumentally, carrying both passion and helplessness in the inflections of his voice. 
 McElroen's subtle direction and tasteful use of silence is especially commendable; he is not afraid to allow emptiness to dominate a scene. The result is an unexpectedly lucid retelling of the narrator’s story. In one such silent scene, the battered and exhausted narrator allows Mary Rambo (Deidra LaWan Starnes) to wash the paint gently from his face with a wet cloth, a silent gesture that effectively defines Mary’s character. Additionally, McElroen daringly shatters the fourth wall in this production. In one inventive moment, the narrator and Dr. Bledsoe (Johnny Lee Davenport) face off in Bledsoe’s office, but instead of facing each other, the narrator and Bledsoe sit side by side, facing the audience. This gives the audience the uncanny opportunity to be both characters in the scene, a blocking choice that opens the dialogue to the audience and asks the listeners to be more active participants in the conflict. The successful translation from novel to stage is also a result of Mary Louise Geiger’s creative lighting. Though occasionally lacking subtlety in some of her choices, such as the flashing lights that seem to accompany most climactic scenes, Geiger still succeeds in taking the characters and audience through various settings according to the narrator's many memories. In the opening scene, a large panel of ceiling lights acts as the ceiling of the narrator’s basement room, from which the narrator claims to have hung 1,369 lights. However, as the scenes shifts from the countryside to an office building to the basement of a painting company, the panel is retracted above the stage and specific lights are lowered individually to complement the huge variety of settings. By the end of the show, the stellar acting and innovative directing and lighting emphasizes the thesis of Ellison's novel; that the invisible man’s story could be true for anyone. “Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?” Bougere says before leaving the stage, a line that seems deserved after he has carefully taken the audience through his own memories. This production of Jacoby's adaption is a spectacular performance that goes beyond the pages of Ellison’s novel and creates new art. Indeed, the interpretation seems to lift the story beyond race and turn it into an open commentary on character, society, and the universality of an invisible man.—Staff writer Se-Ho B.

When the Sackler Museum opened its exhibit “In Harmony: The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art” this week, the occasion marked the first time a Harvard art museum has made use of augmented reality, a technology designed to add a digital layer to a real-world experience.The exhibit utilizes Layar, an app for iOS and Android devices, to allow museum goers to access supplementary digital material about selected objects in the gallery. Exhibit organizers say that the videos, photos, and sound clips made available by the technology are intended to enhance the traditional museum experience for mobile-minded visitors.“It’s not meant to compete with the works. It’s just meant to augment it,” said Jeff Steward, the programmer behind the exhibit’s Layar technology. “We’re just exploring how we can bring out this content to people.”The technology can be used with six items in the Calderwood exhibit, which features a collection of ceramics, illustrated manuscripts, and Persian lacquer primarily from the Persianate world. To access the digital materials, visitors can download the app and scan an item in the exhibit using their devices.The technology works by “solely relying on the uniqueness of the object itself”—that is, by analyzing the item for contrast and unique shapes, Steward said.
Jennifer Novak, the digital communications manager at the Harvard Art Museums and the designer of much of the exhibit’s audio and video content, said that the technology is intended to make works of art “more alive” to museum visitors.“It just gives you more of a backstory and more of a relationship with the object,” Novak said.While peering through the glass at a sweetmeats dish, for example, one can use the Layar technology to simultaneously watch a video showing how the dish is made.Exhibit organizers began discussing using technology to enhance the planned exhibit in April 2012, according to Steward, who is also the Harvard Art Museums’ director of the department of digital infrastructure and emerging technologies.Organizers tested the technology in collaboration with students in a Graduate School of Education course who were asked to use Layar in one of their class projects.After early tests proved promising, Steward said, the team moved ahead with integrating the technology into the exhibit in June 2012.Mary McWilliams, curator of Islamic and Later Indian Art for the Harvard Art Museums, stressed that while the technology has great potential to enhance visitors’ experiences with the exhibit, it remains an experiment.“We want to know how people use it,” McWilliams said. “We want to know if this is a distraction or if this will become the way people look at art.”According to Novak, museum administrators have been discussing how to implement this kind of technology in other campus museums.At the same time, exhibit organizers say that they recognize that the new technology might not be attractive to everyone. They keep magnifying glasses and printed catalogues available for those visitors who might be more comfortable with the traditional museum experience.—Staff writer Gina K.

In Israel, when hawks suffer, doves usually gain. But that’s not what <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/news/israeli-elections-2013"">happened last month, when voters went to the polls to elect a new parliament. The right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did almost lose his premiership, as his Likud-Beiteinu Party shed 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset, and Israelis did vote en masse for the center-left. They did not, however, embrace the peace camp. Former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ran on a promise of renewed negotiations with the Palestinians, and her party, Hatnua, performed abysmally, winning only six seats. When I was in Israel in January, people expressed fatigue with the moribund process. “There is no partner for peace,” they lamented. “We can’t trust the Palestinians.”(Interestingly enough, when a friend visited Palestine, he heard much the same thing). Yet, there was a message in the results, albeit one that has not been heard in a while: Israelis want to pare back the prerogatives that ultra-Orthodox Jews, known as Haredim, enjoy.Israel was first envisioned as a secular state—Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, was an atheist who viewed Jewishness as a national identity. Yet, Mount Herzl, the cemetery where he and other fathers and mothers of the nation are buried, is governed by the dictates of the Haredim. That is because in 1948, when the state was declared, Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/01/01/israel-s-ultra-orthodox-problem.html"">secured the support of the very religious by allowing them to mold the country’s Jewish life.Under the compromise struck between secular and religious elements, the Haredim were given dominion over marriage and divorce policy, funerals, conversions, and kosher certifications, all of which conform to Orthodox standards. The state apparatus and public services were also accommodated to certain aspects of Jewish law, such as strict Shabbos observance. Lastly, the ultra-Orthodox were granted communal autonomy. A separate, state-funded Haredi school system teaching almost exclusively Torah was established. <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19492627"">Legislation was passed exempting yeshiva students from the compulsory military service that other Jewish Israelis perform.There has been a human cost to such concessions. According to the Haredim, Judaism is <a href=""http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html"">transmitted matrilineally, a standard that other movements have relaxed to include those who trace their Jewish ancestry only patrilineally. The Law of Return, which dictates who can claim Israeli citizenship, allows people who have only one Jewish grandparent to immigrate. However, the Haredi definition is used when it comes to rites like marriage, leaving 300,000 Israelis who identify as Jewish but who do not meet the Haredi standard of Jewishness in a state of legal and religious limbo.More ominously, the Haredim’s special privileges have morphed into an existential threat as their population has exploded. Some ultra-Orthodox have taken communal autonomy as an excuse to impose their lifestyle on others, using violence and intimidation to enforce <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/dozens-of-israeli-businesses-sign-modesty-agreement-after-ultra-orthodox-push-1.400914"">“<a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/dozens-of-israeli-businesses-sign-modesty-agreement-after-ultra-orthodox-push-1.400914"">modesty codes<a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/dozens-of-israeli-businesses-sign-modesty-agreement-after-ultra-orthodox-push-1.400914"">” and <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/sex-segregation-on-the-buses-divides-israelis-6279844.html"">gender segregation. The government has condemned these abuses, but it is fundamentally hypocritical to denounce attacks on pluralism in the civil sphere while tolerating a Haredi monopoly in the religious one—a schizoid policy that enables and encourages bad behavior. At present, <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/business/survey-finds-30-of-israeli-primary-school-pupils-are-ultra-orthodox-1.455461"">51 percent of Israeli schoolchildren are Haredi or Arab, belonging to groups that do not serve in the military, depriving the institution of what it most needs: bodies. Finally, many Haredim do not work, relying on state subsidies and going to schools with woefully spare secular curricula, which does not bode well for an economic juggernaut.
On January 22, the Israeli electorate offered up its own deliverance. The contest’s surprise second-place finisher with 19 mandates was journalist-cum-politician Yair Lapid, the leader of the new Yesh Atid Party. He ran as a centrist, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/middleeast/israeli-secularists-find-their-voice-in-yair-lapid.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">pledging to tackle quality-of-life and corruption issues, in addition to a larger commitment of sharing societal burdens more equally. To Lapid, whose father spent decades fighting against the influence of religious parties, burden-sharing means an overhaul of the welfare system and a requirement that religious youths serve in the military. Crucially, Lapid is a supporter of whole society pluralism, advocating the implementation of civil marriage, a rewrite of Haredi lesson plans, and official recognition of the worship and practices of more liberal strains of Judaism.Center-left parties, such as Hatnua and Labor would back such an agenda, and Likud Beiteinu, a largely secular bloc, would probably do so as well, as long it were not beholden to religious parties for a majority in the Knesset. Shelly Yacimovich, the leader of Labor, has <a href=""http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4338121,00.html"">said that her group will not sit in the government. She should rethink her position and join a grand coalition of secularists. It’s not an ideal fit. The alliance would have to put off peace to a later date. But that’s fine. Stopping fanatics within is a prerequisite for dealing with stone-throwers without.Daniel J. Solomon ‘16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Matthews Hall.

The workers will be the same, the name will be similar, but the values will be radically different. Coming in March, The Upper Crust Pizzeria, located on Brattle Street and <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/14/upper-crust-closes-bankruptcy/"">shut down last year amid labor law violations and bankruptcy, will <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/23/upper-crust-reopening/"">reopen as The Just Crust, a venture to be partly owned by the previous chain’s former employees. The opening of The Just Crust will bring to a happy end an ugly story of exploitation and greed. Upper Crust Pizzeria, which had locations in Boston and Washington, D.C., came under fire in the past few years, locked in a series of labor disputes with workers who claimed they had been cheated out of overtime pay and that the chain had hired illegal immigrants. The bad press <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/24/upper-crust-boycott-student/"">prompted boycotts from Harvard student groups and other investigations, one of which led to criminal complaints against the company’s owner. When the U.S. Department of Labor ultimately sided with workers, ordering The Upper Crust to compensate them to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, the firm was forced into bankruptcy proceedings from which it did not emerge.  Rising from the ashes of The Upper Crust is a new venture, The Just Crust, which has been conceived and established by Shannon E. Liss-Riordan, the attorney who represented workers in their battle with Upper Crust management, and local businessperson Haluk Ozek. Riordan <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/23/upper-crust-reopening/"">told The Crimson that she hopes Just Crust and its employee-owned corporate structure serves as a model for other businesses. We couldn’t agree more. Though John Galt would beg to differ, employee ownership has undeniable benefits. According to <a href=""http://www.nber.org/books/krus08-1/"">research done by the National Bureau of Economics, workers at employee-owned enterprises have higher levels of loyalty and trust and lower rates of turnover than do workers at conventional ventures. These businesses also fill gaps left by the free market, tackling otherwise neglected social problems, and in the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, some posited that the model should be re-examined as an alternative to both socialism and conventional capitalism. 
 In truth, the workers at Just Crust will enjoy basically the same privileges and responsibilities that white-collar workers have long been accustomed to. Each employee will receive an ownership stake akin to the stock granted to white-collar employees across the economy. The resulting alignment of incentives is likely to have positive effects on effort, worker treatment, and morale. At the very least, we can rest assured that worker abuse will never rear its head at Just Crust.  That’s a lot to chew on, and we hope to be doing exactly that at The Just Crust next month.

Stephen F. Lynch, the longtime Congressman from South Boston, launched his run for Senate Thursday. In his remarks, Lynch, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate, spoke of a campaign that will rely on a strong grassroots ground game inspired by Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign in her hard-fought victory over incumbent Scott Brown.“We won’t win this race because of money or endorsements or backdoor deals to clear the field,” Lynch told a crowd of more than 300, assembled in the event room at the Ironworkers Local 7 headquarters in South Boston. “We will win by earning the support of the people of this great state by the way it should be won: by courage, by honesty, and by hard work.”Lynch enters the race as the clear underdog. His opponent, Representative Edward J. Markey of Malden, not only leads in the polls but has also been endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who on Friday will vacate the seat now being contested.Additionally, Markey holds about a four-to-one advantage in cash on hand, according to campaign finance reports.But Lynch, who worked as an ironworker for 18 years before entering public service in 1996, embraced his status as a party crasher. Channeling Warren, he said that he was happy not to be a part of the Washington establishment in response to opponents who suggested that he would not fit in with the Senate.
“After I thought about it for a few minutes,” Lynch said, pausing for the punchline, “I had to agree, because it’s true. I will not fit in in the United States Senate, but neither would you.”The crowd, largely composed of card-carrying union members, erupted in raucous applause.Throughout the event, the Warren inspiration was clear, if subtle. In the office where Lynch paced before he entered the event room, a “WARREN FOR SENATE” sign was taped to the window.And before Lynch took the stage, Paul F. Lynch, business manager of Ironworkers Local 7, reminded the crowd of the potential of an organized ground game.“We can do this,” he told them. “We proved it when we put Elizabeth Warren in as a senator. We can do it again.”After his speech, Lynch was asked if he would target younger voters as Warren did with great success.“I want everyone,” he said, adding that college campuses would be a priority. “We’ve got to motivate the younger base.”Seconds later, Lynch shook hands with yet another supporter who offered “anything you need, anything I can do to help.”Relying on his supporters’ enthusiasm, Lynch was cautiously optimistic. When asked if he thought the loyal supporters from his district could reach voters across the state, Lynch responded positively.“Yeah, I think so,” he said. “I don’t have the big money, I don’t have the big endorsements. All I got is people.”—Staff writer Matthew Q. Clarida can be reached clarida@college.harvard.edu.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 2, 2013An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Paul F. Lynch, the business manager of union chapter Ironworkers Local 7, as the brother of Congressman Stephen F. Lynch. In fact, the two men are not related.

In a checkered jacket and with a bright smile, Marion Cotillard—this year’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals Woman of the Year—rode along with the organization’s cast in an annual celebratory parade Thursday.Cotillard, an Academy Award-winning French actress known for her roles in “Inception” and in the biographical French film “La Vie En Rose,” joins an elite group of actresses who have won the award, including Elizabeth Taylor and Meryl Streep. Last year, Claire Danes <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/27/HastyPudding-Parade-ClareDanes/"">received the honor.After the parade, Cotillard was roasted by Hasty Pudding Threaticals members in Farkas Hall. President Renee E. Rober ’13 and Vice President Benjamin K. Moss ’13 emceed the event.Cotillard was nagged by the repetitive presence of a cast member portraying Leonardo DiCaprio, who kept reminding Cotillard that she was in a dream within a dream. Before she was presented her award, the Pudding Pot, Leonardo required Cotillard to perform tasks inspired by movies in which she has starred.Her three tests included demonstrating how to act by reading monologues and performing a death scene, drawing a self portrait, and singing a song from “La Vie En Rose.”

When she had passed all tests, she was presented with her own golden Pudding Pot.“I loved being roasted,” said Cotillard, who came to Boston for the first time to receive the award. “I had no idea what was going to happen, [but] knew it was going to be fun.”Cotillard, who won an Academy Award for her performance in “La Vie En Rose” in 2007, said that she had no advice for this year’s nominees but that she was “totally in love with Jennifer Lawrence.”“The experience is really amazing,” Cotillard said. “You have to have your own experience and just enjoy and have fun.”Although the weather was cold and windy, J.P. Licks passed out free samples of ice cream as many people crowded around Mass. Ave to get a glimpse of Cotillard.“It looked like the entire Cambridge police department was there,” Reylon A. Yount ’16 said. Yount said he enjoyed his first time witnessing a Woman of the Year parade, describing it as a “classic Harvard experience.”The parade and roast drew alumni along with students and professors. Mark P. Szpak ’77, who was president of Hasty Pudding Theatricals when Elizabeth Taylor was named Woman of the Year, came back to see this year’s roast.“There’s nothing like it anywhere in the U.S. or the world,” Szpak said.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

5,979 days.That’s the amount of time between the day Matt Birk ’98 first stepped on a collegiate field as a starter and the day he will do so in the game that marks the pinnacle of his sport.The first of those events, which occurred on September 21, 1996, did not go as Birk would have hoped. Led by senior defensive end Marcellus Wiley, who had a key fourth-quarter field goal block, Columbia earned a 20-13 overtime win over Harvard at Robert K. Kraft Field, where the Crimson had previously been unbeaten for 26 years. Wiley would go on to a ten-year career in the NFL and was an All-Pro in 2001. But despite the end’s triumph on that warm fall day, the man tasked with blocking him would go on to have an even more successful career over the subsequent 17 years.Six Pro Bowls, two All-Pro selections, and two significant leadership awards since, Matt Birk has finally made it to football’s biggest stage.
His journey to that point was as unlikely as it is unprecedented.THE COLLEGE YEARSBirk attended Cretin-Derham High School in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he starred in track and field, football, and basketball, achieving All-State honors in the latter two. His 3.8 GPA also earned him Academic All-State recognition, and his score of 34 on the ACT helped him gain admission to Harvard. “He was one of my first recruits in our first recruiting class in 1994,” Harvard head coach Tim Murphy recalled. “Because I had been hired late in the recruiting season, we were just scrambling to find out about Matt. I knew he had interest in top academic schools.”The lineman arrived in college in September of that year but remained raw during his freshman season.“He wasn’t one of those guys that came to Harvard with NFL ability,” Murphy said.Slowly but surely, that began to change. After earning sparse playing time as a sophomore backup, Murphy named Birk his starting left tackle before the 1996 campaign. In his first year in the lineup, the undersized economics major had his struggles. But when he came back for his senior season, Birk was a completely different player, physically and talent-wise.“He started his junior year, had a rocky year, and was probably 6’5”, 275 [pounds],” teammate and blockmate Colby Skelton ’98 told the Crimson last year. “He came back his senior year at 300 pounds and dominated—simply dominated.”With the senior anchoring the left side of the offensive line, Harvard went undefeated in conference play and finished 9-1 overall.“He probably improved more from his freshman year to his senior year than any guy I’ve ever been around,” Murphy said. “In his senior year, he became a quiet leader of the offense. He was such a consistent player, such a dominant force on the team and on the football field that everybody on the offense worked a little harder, played a little harder, and certainly believed a little bit more.”

The online edition of The Crimson has just undergone a significant relaunch, a culmination of months of collaboration from the redesign team. This redesign, the first in four years, came to fruition through a series of design and concept iterations plus thousands of lines of code.The redesign began in early 2012 with the creation of a new concept, style guide, and design philosophy. We sought a seamlessly responsive design and a more maintainable, modern, and media-oriented site. The design, concept, and responsive implementation were the work of Preston G. So ’14, outgoing Director of Web Strategy.Last fall we redoubled our efforts to ready the site for the redesign, translating the new look into code in preparation for its J-term transfer into our web application framework, completed on Jan. 27 by Nikhil L. Benesch ’16, incoming Tech Associate, and Joseph R. Botros ’15, incoming Technology Manager.The online edition in its current state concludes our first phase for website development. Over the next several months the second phase, which seeks to implement a variety of further changes, will be executed to improve the user experience and administrative sustainability.With our site now “responsive,” the same code will present the same overarching experience, no matter what device used to browse our new website. There is no need for pinch-and-zoom, nor any appearance of illegibly minuscule text.
Only a few major news organizations have responsive websites, such as <a href=""http://bostonglobe.com/"">The Boston Globe and <a href=""http://time.com/"">Time Magazine. We are honored to have created one of the first responsive college newspaper sites in the Ivy League and among the first worldwide. Most importantly, we are excited by the enhancements in the design and user experience of the site.Not only did we update the templates that control how our site looks in your Internet browser; we tweaked the internals as well to eliminate the old fixes intended to get content live as quickly as possible.The online edition is powered by<a href=""http://djangoproject.com/""> Django, an open-source framework for building web applications. In a newsroom, we must be able to build, test, and deploy new functionality in hours, not days. Django allows rapid construction of these new features, while keeping the code clear and maintainable. We are adapting to make full use of Django’s flexibility, and in the next few months, we will be able to more easily incorporate supplementary content, like Flash graphics and multimedia slideshows.Although this redesign was the work of a core trio of individuals, we offer our thanks to all who contributed. Our appreciation to Kevin Grinberg at Active Frequency for damage control and some technical advice. We are also grateful to the many Crimson editors who composed the concept team and the implementation team, in addition to all beta testers, section executives, and others both in and out of the organization who furnished invaluable feedback and encouragement to help us reach the finish line.Now, we invite you to use our website anywhere, on any device. We hope our endeavor has made The Crimson a richer and more robust news source, now not solely in newsprint but also on any device.Nikhil L. Benesch ’16, a Crimson Technology Associate, lives in Matthews Hall. Joseph R. Botros ’15, Crimson Technology Manager, is a molecular and cellular biology concentrator in House. Preston G. So ’14, Crimson Director of Web Strategy, is a linguistics concentrator in Pforzheimer House. All three helped produce The Crimson’s new website enhancements.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 4, 2013An ealier version of this article incorrectly stated that the newly redesigned thecrimson.com is the first responsive college newspaper site in the Ivy League.

People can now explore every known inch of the universe with the wave of a hand, according to astronomy professor Alyssa A. Goodman, who demonstrated Microsoft’s WorldWide Telescope Program at the Harvard Allston Education Portal on Thursday.Allston-Brighton residents gathered to watch Goodman exhibit the computer program, which allows users to interactively explore and learn about millions of objects in the universe.As one of the most comprehensive databases of astronomical information, the program was designed to visualize the universe for astrophysical research.“This is better for [astrophysical] research than any other tools made before,” Goodman said.Goodman emphasized the WorldWide Telescope Program as a tool for the general public and not just for practicing astronomers.
“[The program] has huge educational potential,” Goodman said, adding that users can go on personalized “tours of the sky” and bring their friends and family along for the ride.“One of the main educational goals is for people to be able to use it as a story-telling platform,” she said, a point which she illustrated by showing the audience a six-year-old boy’s favorite nebula.     “The way people learn anything is by telling themselves a story they can remember.”According to Goodman, one Boston-area high school student called the telescope program “cooler than ‘Call of Duty.’”Luke H. Black, a 12-year-old Allston resident who attended the lecture, said, “It’s cool getting to learn about all the amazing stuff out there.”The lecture was part of the Ed Portal’s Faculty Speaker Series, which is intended to connect Harvard faculty to the Allston community.According to Robert A. Lue, faculty director of the Ed Portal and professor of the practice of molecular and cellular biology, Goodman “takes very seriously the mission to communicate science to as many people as possible, the mission to get people excited about science.”Lue’s articulation of Goodman’s goals fits the Ed Portal’s mission as expressed on its website, which is to build on “Harvard’s commitment to education beyond the classroom.”Founded by Harvard in 2008, the Ed Portal offers a variety of tutoring, mentoring, and educational programs for the broader community.—Staff writer Marco J.

UPDATED: February 1, 2013, at 11:16 p.m.Approximately 600 students spilled out of Fong Auditorium on Wednesday for Folklore and Mythology 90i: “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature”—nearly twice as many as had <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/27/Course-Lotteries/"">shopped the class last year. The overwhelming interest dwarfed Pre-Term Planning expectations, which projected that about 400 students would shop the course. And of those nearly 600, only 45 were accepted after a lottery that left hundreds of students without the chance to take their first-choice class.As the number of interested students in some already oversubscribed classes continues to grow and Pre-Term Planning data at times fails to accurately predict student interest, professors face the dilemma of how best to accommodate students while still maintaining the quality of their classes.“It always feels distressing,” Maria Tatar, instructor of Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature, said of having to lottery her course.“After the lottery, I always get a flood of emails asking to be put on the waitlist. I realize that in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter—there are hundreds of other great courses in the catalog—but it’s not a feel-good experience.”
Ryuichi Abe, who teaches Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 36: “Buddhism and Japanese Culture,” wrote in an email that he was able to plan for higher student interest thanks to a notification from the General Education office over winter break indicating potential increases in enrollment.But even planning in advance was not enough. Abe recruited three teaching fellows to lead six sections and 108 students—a 71.4 percent increase from the year before—but 344 students entered his lottery this week.English professor Helen Vendler’s Gen Ed course Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 20: “Poems, Poets, Poetry” expected a little over 90 students but saw more than 200 show up at the first lecture.Pre-Term Planning data and actual student interest do not always align, as evidenced by this semester’s shopping week. But Administrative Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen wrote in an email that the Pre-Term Planning process, which was introduced in late 2010, is still evolving.“We are still learning about how to interpret these numbers while allowing students the freedom to visit courses during shopping week,” Kenen wrote.She added that Gen Ed courses are often lotteried due to a lack of resources. In other cases, such as when professors are introducing new courses to the curriculum, limiting enrollment can help the teaching staff adjust.“Often a lottery is the best way to ensure that a course will run smoothly and provide the best learning environment for our students,” Kenen wrote.The Gen Ed office has a general policy that lotteries be run randomly, she added, although there are certain exceptions. Abe, for example, was granted permission to give preference to students studying East Asian Studies. Similarly, Tatar grants priority to folklore and mythology concentrators and seniors who have been lotteried out of the course twice.Vendler was able to hire enough teaching fellows to accommodate the unexpectedly high turnout for her Gen Ed course and said she is thankful to have avoided a lottery.“I know how disappointing a lottery is,” Vendler said.—Staff writer Madeline R. Conway can be reached at mconway@college.harvard.edu.

""30 Rock,"" the NBC comedy series known for its absurdist humor and its ambitious, awkward, sandwich-loving protagonist, Liz Lemon, died last night in Manhattan. It was seven seasons old. <!--more-->Born in 2006, ""30 Rock"" survived longer than most television critics predicted it would, given its small cult following. But the show's niche appeal also provided its staying power, if not huge Nielsen numbers.The cause of death was that all good things must come to an end. The show is known for several choice lines including, ""I want to go to there,"" ""Shut it down"" (or ""S that D""), and ""We know what art is! It's paintings of horses!"" The story was naturally winding down, so rather than resuscitating the plot—bringing back Hazel Wassername, making Criss and Liz divorce, pushing Liz and Jack together—the creators let the show die a peaceful death.By the end of 2012, each member of the cast of crazies was well on their way to happiness. Jack Donaghy defeated the teenage Kaylie Hooper and took over Kabletown. Liz married Criss in a Princess Leia gown and adopted two children, one black and one white. And Dr. Leo Spaceman was promoted to Surgeon General of the United States.The finale last night, an hour of kooky storytelling, inside jokes, and a few touching (if cockeyed) moments, stayed true to ""30 Rock"" form. The mentor relationship between Jack and Liz reached its culmination after one last bump in the road: ""You’re just an alcoholic with a great voice!"" says Liz.
The show's refusal to pair Jack and Liz together made a platonic relationship the focus of ""30 Rock."" Yes, Liz's myriad relationships with assorted crazies—well, Floyd was normal—and her relationship with her own success and priorities made ""30 Rock"" particularly compelling to the female demographic. But the Jack-Liz relationship provided a foundation for all the antics at everyone's favorite, least-watched, live variety show, ""TGS."" It was a love based on friendship and the exchange of insults and ideas. Liz's loneliness provided a lot of material for ""30 Rock,"" but she was never really alone, and the show illustrated how full one's life could be without a romantic partner.In lieu of flowers, meatball subs, cupcake sandwiches, and other consumable donations can be made to Liz Lemon.

Harvard’s Office of Federal Relations spent about $510,000 on lobbying in Washington D.C. in the calendar year of 2012, approximately the same amount as <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/2/university-lobby-totals-congress/"">in 2011, according to public records filed with Congress.Throughout 2012, Harvard lobbied on legislation relating to education, federal research funding, and charitable deductions, among other issues, according to the forms. Their efforts targeted both chambers of Congress, the White House, and the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services.A little more than $100,000 of the money spent by Harvard on lobbying in 2012 went to the law firm O’Neill, Athy, and Casey, which advises and conducts research for the University’s lobbyists.Harvard’s lobbying expenditures were significantly higher than those of its peer institutions like Princeton University, Columbia University, Cornell University, and Brown University, all of which spent less than $250,000 in 2012, and Dartmouth College, which spent nothing on lobbying. <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000022295&amp;year=2012"">Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania each spent $540,000 and $680,000, respectively.Harvard’s D.C.-based federal relations office coordinates the University’s lobbying efforts by communicating with members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation and with members of committees that cover issues of concern to Harvard, such as budget appropriations, science, health, education, and labor.
“When big issues are being discussed by the government, like discretionary spending, [lobbying] shows that we have this really strong partnership,” said Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications. Casey staffs Harvard’s D.C. office with Suzanne Day, director of federal relations.Casey and Day said that the budget crises over the past couple of years, including last year’s debate over deficit reduction that <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/30/sequestration-research-budget-cuts/"">threatened Harvard’s research funding, has required targeted attention from Harvard’s lobbyists.“I think there was a certain intensity to the communications with campus at that time,” Casey said. “The timing was unusual, but I wouldn’t say it was at all unpredictable.”He added that sequestration—non-defense discretionary spending cuts that will take effect if Congress does not agree on a budget by March 1—still poses a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/3/sequestration-fiscal-deal-spending/"">threat to Harvard’s research funding. Casey said that in its lobbying efforts, Harvard has tried to convince Congress that supporting education and research facilitates innovation, which is crucial to a thriving economy.“We’re still hopeful that in the time between now and the sequestration deadline, that some of the arguments about research and education being the solution take hold,” Casey said.While Harvard has directed far more money towards lobbying at times, Day said that these fluctuations are less a result of economic conditions than a product of the type of issues on which Harvard’s lobby focuses its attention.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Samuel Y.

This time, there was no need for another dramatic comeback for the Harvard men’s basketball team. Instead, the focus was on staving one off.Six days after storming back from down 10 with 94 seconds to go to tie and eventually beat Dartmouth in overtime, Harvard found itself on the opposite end of a similar situation Friday night against Yale.Up seven with 50 seconds remaining, the Crimson turned it over three times before the final buzzer, allowing the Bulldogs to make a late run.With six seconds left in the contest, co-captain Christian Webster was called for an off-ball foul as Harvard attempted to make an inbounds pass, giving Yale possession with the chance to tie. But Matt Townsend passed up a wide-open Greg Kelley behind the arc and instead chose to attempt a layup, which he missed.“I understand the strategy to try to get a quick two,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I wouldn’t say that was a bad strategy [Friday night].”
After Harvard grabbed the rebound, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers calmly sunk his ensuing two free throws, and Harvard hung on for a 67-64 win.But it was not one that came without suspense, continuing what has become a heart wrenching trend for the Crimson. Six of Harvard’s last nine games have been decided by seven points or fewer.“We weren’t very disciplined, I thought, in the second half defensively, and you give a lot of credit to Yale,” Amaker said. “Obviously we did what we needed to do to finish [the game] with a W, but certainly we need to play better in stretches to give us the chance to not give up the kind of lead we had.”MARCH OF DIMESAll season long, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders has scored consistently and often prodigiously, leading the conference with 16.2 points per game.On Friday night, Saunders neared that average by pouring in 15 points. But the sophomore also did something to which he was not so accustomed—rack up assists.Saunders entered the contest averaging 3.5 helpers per contest, with a season high of six. But against the Bulldogs, the wing was able to find the open man time and time again, registering a career-high 11 assists.“I [knew] I had a lot, [but] I didn’t know I had 11,” Saunders said. “I just [went] out there and showed everybody I could pass the ball.”Combined with his point total, that number gave Saunders his first collegiate double-double.“The 11 assists is incredible,” Amaker said. “I think Wesley is the best all-around player in our league.... There’s nothing he can’t do. He handles the ball, he rebounds it, he’s big, he’s strong, he scores, and he’s our best perimeter defender. We rely on him so much that it’s amazing and I’m so happy to see that he’s been able to come through for us in so many different [statistical] categories.”

The Harvard men’s hockey team had nine minutes with the man advantage to address its power play woes. RPI had other plans.The Engineers (9-11-5; 4-6-3 ECAC) allowed the Crimson (5-14-1; 3-12-0 ECAC) power play unit only a single shot on net as RPI stifled the visitors, 3-0, in Troy, N.Y., Friday night.Officials issued a game misconduct to Johnny Rogic and five-minute major to RPI after the sophomore Engineer forward sent Alex Fallstrom to the ice with a hit from behind. Fallstrom was able to reach the bench on his own power but left the rink, limping, three minutes later.Harvard failed to establish an offensive presence during the resulting power play. The Crimson registered zero shots on goal while the RPI penalty kill managed to put the puck on Girard.At full strength, the Engineers went on the attack, outshooting Harvard, 12-3, in the first frame. With just over a minute left in the period, a shot from Mark Miller found its way past a dense four-player screen to give RPI its first goal of the night.
Early in the second period, the Crimson saw its best offensive chance of the game during its second power play of the game. Freshman forward Jimmy Veesey got a clean look from just outside of the crease, but his shot bounced harmlessly off the inside of the post.A hooking minor on Harvard forward Luke Greiner canceled the remaining 14 seconds of the Crimson’s second power play. Twelve seconds into RPI’s man-advantage, freshman forward Mike Zalewski provided the Engineers an insurance marker with a wrap-around goal.RPI continued to frustrate the Harvard attack through the third, allowing Harvard only two shots on goal during the final 20 minutes. Less than three minutes into the period, Miller recorded his second goal of the night from the top of the crease as he deflected an outside slapper from teammate Nick Bailen.Harvard failed to convert on a third power play opportunity midway through the final frame as the Crimson fell to 4-for-63 in conference play with the man advantage. Freshman Engineer goaltender Jason Kasdorf cruised to his first career shutout as RPI finished the night outshooting Harvard, 23-11.—Staff writer Michael D.

Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle led the Crimson (11-6, 2-1 Ivy) to a 67-54 win over Yale (6-11, 1-2 Ivy), registering a career-high 20 points in New Haven on Friday. The game was Harvard’s first conference road trip of the season.After Harvard took an early lead, the Bulldogs looked to lessen the deficit heading into the second half, but the Crimson caught another quick wind and ended the game with a 43.8 team shooting percentage. The Yale offense consistently failed to find the basket throughout the match, going 20-72. By the end of the first frame, the Bulldogs put up a low 19.4 shooting percentage.“We’ve been working really hard,” junior center Elise Gordon said. “We’ve been working on our different defenses, so the fact that we have such a variety of defenses that we can use makes [our opponents] have to counteract, which is definitely to our advantage.”Fagbenle and Gordon pressured Yale early on in the first frame, scoring several combined points in the paint after the starting tipoff. Harvard held a double-digit lead for the majority of the period and led the Bulldogs at halftime, 32-20.“Temi is a great player,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “She’s awesome to play with and I think [at] Yale having 20 points as her career high is a great building block for her, and I think that’s going to motivate her during the rest of the Ivy League games.”
The second period brought tighter competition, with Yale closing the gap to three points in the final 14 minutes. The Crimson defense buckled down and finished the game with a team season-high of 50 rebounds.“We had a couple of games where we haven’t been able to overcome adversity, and what we really wanted to focus on was possession-by-possession and basically just converting to offense,” Gordon said. “We would make goals for ourselves and just be one play ahead.Fagbenle chipped in nine rebounds and a steal of her own, while co-captain forward Miriam Rutzen and junior guard Christine Clark had a combined rebound total of 14, registering seven apiece.“I think Yale especially was a really good team effort,” Curtis said. “I thought during Yale we did a good job of defending the following side against the post. They were playing pretty tough on our guards.”The Harvard bench showed out with a total of 24 points, while Yale’s bench only registered eight. Rutzen, Curtis, and junior forward Missy Mullens tallied two assists each for the Crimson.“Our team has so many weapons,” said Gordon. “We’ve got a really deep bench.”Despite a Bulldogs rally in the second half, exceeding their first-period point total by 14, the Crimson headed to the locker room with a comfortable lead. Harvard held off the Yale second-period run that defeated the Crimson during the 2011-2012 season.“We kept padding it inside, getting inside-out looks and I think Elise executed really well on a lot of those, as well as a lot of other players that came off the bench and really contributed to the team effort,” Curtis said.After Fagbenle, Gordon registered the highest number of points at ten, while Curtis and senior guard Elle Hagedorn chipped in nine and eight points, respectively.Fagbenle recently received her sixth Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor this week. The sophomore has racked in a total of eight Ancient Eight awards on the season. The forward also registered nine rebounds, one assist, one block, and one steal in under 22 minutes.Yale’s final 27.8 shooting percentage marked the lowest of a Harvard opponent since the Crimson played against TCU in early January. The bulldogs never led Harvard by more than three points during the matchup.--Staff writer Kelley Guinn McArtor can be reached at kelleyguinnmcartor@college.harvard.edu.--Follow her on Twitter @KGMCrimson

“Another typical night in the Ivy League,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said with a smile.Less than a week after battling back from a 10-point deficit with 90 seconds remaining to grab an overtime victory over Dartmouth, the Crimson nearly turned in an epic collapse of its own.Hosting Yale on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard saw its 13-point second-half lead cut to three with under a minute remaining.But unlike Dartmouth, the Crimson managed to hold on in the final seconds, topping the Bulldogs, 67-64.“This conference has always been that way,” Amaker said. “Hard-fought all the way.”
With the win, the Crimson improved to 3-0 in the Ivy League, leaving Harvard and Princeton the only two undefeated teams in the conference.But the Crimson was only a few possessions away from suffering its first conference loss of the season.With 19 seconds remaining, Yale’s Armani Cotton capitalized on a Siyani Chambers’ turnover, finishing a layup to pull the visitors within three.The Crimson then inbounded the ball to sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi who was fouled and sent to the line with 18 seconds left. Moundou-Missi, who missed all four of his free-throw attempts earlier in the contest, stuck both shots to put Harvard back up by five.Following a Michael Grace jump shot on the other end, Yale’s Matt Townsend pulled down an offensive rebound and was fouled going back up with six seconds remaining.Townsend knocked down both free throws to cut Harvard’s lead back down to three.Following Townsend’s second make, the Crimson set up in its press break. But before Harvard could successfully inbound the ball, co-captain Christian Webster was whistled for an offensive foul, returning the ball to the Bulldogs with six seconds remaining and a chance to even the score.But on the ensuing inbounds play, the Bulldogs missed a wide-open Greg Kelley on the perimeter and Townsend missed a contested layup. Chambers came up with the ball and was sent to the line where he iced the game with two free throws.In the win, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders recorded his first career double-double, posting a game-high 15 points and 11 assists.“I think Wesley is the best all-around player in our league,” Amaker said. “I know I’m biased, but there’s nothing he can’t do. He handles the ball, he rebounds it, he’s big, he’s strong, he scores, and he’s our best perimeter defender. We rely on him so much that it’s amazing, and I’m so happy to see how he’s been able to come through for us in so many different categories.”

Senior Kyle Juszczyk may have made his mark for the Crimson as Harvard’s all-time leader in receptions (125), receiving yards (1,576), and touchdowns (22) for a tight end, but he is catching NFL scouts’ eye at a different position—fullback.<a name=""jump"">
Interest in the two-time All-American is growing after a compelling performance at the Senior Bowl, an annual showcase for the nation’s top draft prospects, last week in Mobile, A.L. ESPN expert Mel Kiper Jr. was impressed enough to list <a href=""http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft2013/story/_/id/8896881/2013-nfl-draft-mel-kiper-top-5-prospects-every-position"">Juszczyk as his fifth-best fullback prospect for April’s NFL Draft.
Juszczyk is projected to be a 5th to 7th round pick. If he is not drafted, he is expected to make his way as an undrafted free agent. The three-time All-Ivy League tight end hopes to join fellow Crimson alums Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, Matt Birk ’98, and Desmond Bryant ’09 in the pros.
Juszczyk, listed at 6’3”, is considered by many scouts to be too short to play tight end in the NFL, but is well suited to transition to the fullback or halfback position. Although Juszczyk faces the dual challenges of learning a new position and facing off against a higher level of competition throughout the draft process, scouts remain interested. They believe that his physicality and toughness when blocking are skills that will translate well to the next level. Further, he has prior experience running the ball, as he led his high school team in both rushing and receiving during his senior season at Cloverleaf High School in Medina, Ohio.
For now, Juszczyk will wait to see if his Senior Bowl performance was enough to earn him an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine in February, where he can further his case to impress teams and earn a shot at being drafted.

The victories just won’t come easily for the Harvard men’s basketball team. But no matter how difficult the Crimson continues to make things for itself, Harvard continues to win.In a double-overtime thriller at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson (12-6, 4-0 Ivy) remained undefeated in Ancient Eight play by knocking off Brown, 89-82.Just like its last two contests in its home arena, the triumph did not come without a great deal of nail biting for its fans, who witnessed Harvard blow a 22-point second-half advantage before eventually escaping with the victory.“I wish we would’ve been able to hold the lead and not have all the drama associated with this, but [it was] certainly a sensational basketball game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’re very fortunate and pleased to have won.”After the Crimson went up, 63-41, with 12:58 to go, it looked well on its way to its first easy conference win of the season. But the Bears (8-10, 2-2) slowly rallied back from there, and Sean McGonagill hit a jumper at the buzzer to force overtime after Brown outscored Harvard, 28-6, down the stretch.
Co-captain Christian Webster’s left wing three-pointer put Harvard up three with 38 seconds remaining in the first overtime, but Brown’s Stephen Albrecht answered back with a long ball of his own 18 seconds later to tie the game at 78. Sophomore wing Wesley Saunders' reverse layup rimmed out at the overtime buzzer, and the teams went to a second set of extra time from there.In the second overtime period, Saunders put the Crimson up six, 88-82, with an and-one layup, and the Bears could not rally back for the third time as Harvard held on for the win.Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers posted his second career double-double in the victory, registering 17 points, 10 assists, and six rebounds. Saunders led the Crimson with 18 points, while Webster and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard both added 16.“I gave our team so much praise in the locker room after the game to have the toughness, the poise, and the confidence after losing the lead like that,” Amaker said.After Chambers’ 14 points led the Crimson to a 49-36 lead at the break—its most points scored in a first half this year—Harvard expanded its advantage to 22 at the beginning of the second. But it quickly witnessed its lead shrink to eight during a five-minute scoreless stretch midway through the half until Saunders finally ended the scoring drought with a steal and transition dunk at the 7:01 mark.“It’s just a trend for us—in the second half, for some reason, we  come out slow,” sophomore wing Wesley Saunders said. “I think it might  be because our bench is on the other side of the court, so our defensive  intensity might not be as [strong]. It’s something we need to work on.”Brown continued to chip away at the advantage and got within five on a layup by Cedric Kuakumensah, who beat Rivard off an inbounds with 1:04 remaining.“I think we got complacent,” Webster said. “I think our defense was lacking…. That’s been something that’s been happening the last few games and that’s something we’ve got to fix.”The Crimson committed a shot clock violation on its next possession, and Kuakumensah hit two free throws at the other end.Rivard, fouled after the ensuing inbounds, hit one of his two free throws, but McGonagill banked in a long three from the top of the key to cut the deficit to two, 69-67, with 13.1 seconds to go.

Yale student Brendan Ross, the driver of a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/19/yale-uhaul-victim-killed/"">U-Haul truck that killed one woman and injured two others at the 2011 Harvard-Yale Game tailgate, was granted a form of probation Friday that allows him to avoid a criminal record. The program, known as accelerated rehabilitation, allows charges against first-time offenders to be dismissed if they complete probation without incident. During his probation, Ross must complete 400 hours of community service. The court's decision was the result of an agreement struck between all groups involved in the trial. 
 “It was a result of cooperation and collaboration of all interested parties,"" said Ross’s attorney William F. Dow III.This past April, Sarah Short, one of the women injured in the crash and a student at the Yale School of Management, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/11/yale-victim-sues-driver/"">filed a suit in the New Haven Superior Court against Ross and U-Haul for at least $15,000 worth of damages caused by the incident.In May, Ross was initially <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/5/yale-student-arrested-tailgate/"">arrested and charged with reckless driving and negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, a misdemeanor charge carrying a possible punishment of up to six months in jail. He turned himself in to New Haven police after finishing his last exam of the spring semester of his junior year.But the prosecution agreed to lower the charges against Ross to reckless driving and reckless endangerment, making him eligible for the accelerated rehabilitation program.Dow said that throughout the legal process, he was impressed by both Ross’s integrity and the understanding of the family of Nancy Barry, the 30-year-old Salem, Mass., resident who was killed in the accident.“It’s one of those things where the level of decency of the defendant is matched by the forgiveness and decency of the family. There was complete synchronization of values. It’s just so refreshing to see that,” Dow said.On Nov. 19, 2011, Ross was driving a U-Haul carrying beer kegs to his fraternity’s tailgate party when the accident occurred. Witnesses said at the time that the truck unexpectedly sped up as it turned into a pedestrian-heavy area of the tailgate. The crash killed Barry and injured Short and one other woman.Ross tested clean in a sobriety test issued immediately following the accident. Even so, Yale has since <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/1/21/yale-tailgate-kegs-ban/"">tightened its restrictions on drinking before the annual Game, requiring that tailgates shut down by kickoff and banning U-Hauls and kegs from the student section of the tailgate. —Staff writer Elizabeth S.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> <p style=""display: inline !important;"">  A$AP Rocky’s name has been on the lips of admirers and haters alike since he released his debut mixtape “LiveLoveA$AP” in 2011, and last month, the Harlem native further solidified his artistic persona with his debut album “Long.Live.A$AP.” The album is a celebration of the 24-year-old rapper’s versatility, paying homage not to the established greats of hip-hop, but to the young and novel voices popping up in the genre. Rocky places himself firmly at the fore of this wave of fresh faces, and while he does not have as compelling a message as others, his nimble verses make him worthy of a position of respect in modern hip-hop.“Long.Live.A$AP” stands in stark contrast to other recent hip-hop releases, such as Kendrick Lamar’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” with its extreme stylistic range within the genre. Where Lamar mined one style of rap to its greatest depths, bringing forth emphatic themes through sincerity and intensity, Rocky sets out on a more gleeful exploratory expedition. The album experiments wildly with production techniques, swinging from a pensive, minimal soundscape crafted by Clams Casino on “LVL” to the frenetic, aggressively kinetic laser bursts of Skrillex on “Wild for the Night” and refusing to settle on single aesthetic framework.
Rocky showcases his fluidity on each track—he sounds totally at ease on every one as he traverses wildly disparate sonic environments. His wordplay and cadence never show a hint of strain, evident as he lists designers against the glistening production of “Fashion Killa”: “I see your Jil Sanders, your Oliver Peoples/ Costume National, Ann Demeuelemeester/ See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain.” Then a mere two tracks later, he is railing, “Fuck them other niggas, I’ll ride for my niggas, I’ll die for my niggas” over a murky, oppressive, Odd Future-esque beat on “Jodye.”As Rocky lays his verse alongside those of his peers Lamar, Joey Bada$$, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Big K.R.I.T. on “1 Train,” he captures the sense of a classic posse track, with a crew of young rappers delivering their best over an unassuming beat. This track unintentionally highlights Rocky’s less-than-virtuosic rapping ability, though, as it places him next to Big K.R.I.T. As K.R.I.T spits, “Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin’ ships / Chokin’ niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with,” he manages to deliver the lines with equal ease and aggression, and he stays perfectly on beat as he delivers blow after blow to his haters. In comparison, Rocky’s delivery and wordplay sound lackluster, but he maintains interest with a healthy amount of attitude and flair.The album ultimately suffers from A$AP Rocky’s post-rap ethos, which manifests as an overreliance on style. “Long.Live.A$AP” is rife with provocative ideas and gripping hooks, but these elements drift about without the proper fundamentals to anchor them. The songs never progress past innovative to become compelling, as Rocky’s entertaining but aimless lyrics meander around each track. A distorted, demonic voice chants ominously on “Pain,” adding a stirring dark dimension to the track, but it rings slightly hollow without more substantive songwriting from Rocky. The contrast between the sinister, disembodied voice and Rocky’s rapping is never utilized for any real purpose; it is a superficially appealing device and never builds to anything more.There is no strong narrative arc tying the album’s many ideas together, but “Long.Live.A$AP” does not want for one. As 2 Chainz gleefully informs us, “I love bad bitches, that’s my fucking problem / and yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem” on “Fuckin’ Problems,” there can be no confusion as to whether or not the artists are enjoying themselves. What makes this album compelling is not inspired songwriting, but rather the bravado and spirit of the performers. Many of the tracks are quite simple thematically, and most fail to develop past their initial premise, but on tracks like “Fuckin’ Problems,” the listener cannot help but have fun as A$AP and company let loose with reckless abandon.Rocky has more than enough panache to carry his first full-length album to success—”Long.Live.A$AP” stands as a testament to the young rapper’s flexibility and willingness to experiment musically. The tracks bounce from high to low energy at a rapid pace as Rocky skips effortlessly along on top of diverse beats on various tracks. What holds the album back is Rocky’s lack of lyrical structure and direction, as his writing lags behind his rapping and his thematic arc withers in the face of garish production. Rocky has put forth an album that serves as a good first step of a young artist, but leaves ample room for artistic growth.—Staff writer Alexander Tang can be reached at tang@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: February 3, 2013, at 9:20 p.m.A charter bus carrying 42 passengers en route to the Philadelphia area crashed around 7:30 p.m. Saturday as it attempted to pass under the Western Avenue Bridge in the eastbound lanes of Soldiers Field Road. As many as 35 passengers, many of them high school students who had toured Harvard earlier in the day, were hospitalized with several sustaining serious injuries Saturday night, according to David Procopio, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts State Police.Procopio wrote in a press release early Sunday morning that two seriously injured victims were still being treated at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, while another with life-threatening injuries was being treated at Boston Medical Center. Many of those with more minor injuries were released early Sunday morning, he wrote.Seven passengers remained in Boston-area hospitals Sunday evening, according to Desiree Goodwin, an assistant librarian at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design who was with the group before and after the crash.Discharged victims spent the night in donated rooms at the DoubleTree Suites hotel in Allston and returned to the Philadelphia area Sunday evening, Goodwin said.

Goodwin said she and others, including Harvard undergraduates, rallied late Saturday night to help find food, shelter, and transportation for the victims.The students involved in the crash were traveling on a day trip with the Destined for a Dream Foundation, a nonprofit organization in  Bristol, Pa. that serves at-risk youth. The foundation puts together periodic day trips to visit college campuses around the country, exposing high school students who might otherwise rule out college to opportunities in higher education.During their trip Saturday, students met with a representative of Harvard’s Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program at the College Admissions Office and took an official campus tour before having a group dinner at Uno Chicago Grill in Harvard Square.The students came from various high schools in the Philadelphia area and in nearby Trenton, N.J., according to Goodwin. Erica Waller-Hill, the foundation’s founder, led the trip.The crash likely occurred shortly after the group left the Harvard Square area, Goodwin said.The collision badly damaged the bus, ripping off a large portion of the bus’s roof.State Police first received a call about the accident at approximately 7:45 p.m., according to State Police trooper Reid Bagley. Dozens of firefighters rescued passengers from the wreckage, including four who had to be cut out of the bus. All passengers were rescued by 9 p.m.Procopio wrote that due to its size, the bus should not have been on the stretch of road or tried to pass under the bridge, which has a 10-foot clearance. He added that “the driver will likely be cited for an overheight violation.”Police have identified the driver of the charter as 66-year-old Samuel J. Jackson of Philadelphia.The charter was operated by Calvary Coach, a small Phiadelphia-based charter service. The company’s owner Raymond Talmadge told Philadelphia’s NBC affiliate NBC 10 that Jackson was looking at a GPS device, not the road, as he approached the Western Avenue Bridge.

While the rest of us are trying to pick spring classes and stay out of the cold, the Harvard ice hockey teams have different priorities. Facing off against BU, BC and Northeastern in the Beanpot next week, the men’s and women’s teams will look to prove that they are the dominant hockey force in Boston. The two week tournament is never an easy win, but it’s always worth watching. The Back Page breaks down some of the best Harvard Beanpot victories in recent memory.
 2005 Women’s Hockey Team Makes it Seven in a Row 
In its seventh straight Beanpot victory, the team cruised to a 6-1 victory over Boston College. The 6-1 win was the team’s 11th in a row for the 2004-2005 season. Although the Crimson started slowly, failing to make it on the board in the first 13 minutes, it quickly picked up steam after freshman Laura Brady found the net. Two minutes later, Harvard was up by two and didn’t slow down. The Eagle’s best look and only goal came during a 5-3 advantage.
 2012 Men’s Hockey Team Takes Home Third 
Although the team was shut out of the championship game, Harvard did not stop playing. Taking on the Huskies in the consolation game, the Crimson avoided coming in last place in the tournament with a 2-3 win over Northeastern. In a back-and-forth matchup, Harvard never gained a comfortable lead. Just seconds after the Crimson went up, 3-1, the Huskies responded, bringing them within one goal again. Harvard’s defense carried the team the rest of the way.
 1999 Women’s Hockey Dominates Boston College 
In a decisive 9-0 victory, the women’s hockey team proved itself once again to be the best in Boston. The Crimson only needed one to take the title, and co-captain A.J. Mleczko—who led the nation in scoring at the time—got it done early in the first period. Mleczko would go on to net two more in a hat trick. After finding goal only once in the first period—thanks to strong defense by Eagles’ goaltender Christy Nentwig—Harvard turned it on after the break and left Boston College in the dust.
 1993 Men’s Hockey Team Wins it All 
In Harvard’s most recent Beanpot championship win, the Crimson upset Boston University in a 4-2 victory. The Terriers entered the contest having won the last three tournaments—two over Harvard—and intent on adding a fourth title to the list. But Harvard was not content to let history repeat itself, and defied all expectations by seizing the lead early and never giving it up.

Despite leading by 22 with 12:58 to play in the second half of its league contest against Brown, the Harvard men’s basketball team found itself all tied up at the end of regulation.And while the Crimson eventually claimed a victory, 89-82, in thrilling fashion at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday, the double-overtime contest was not Harvard’s first surprising game against the Bears in recent memory.  Nor was it the first time co-captain Christian Webster helped spur his team to victory over Brown at home.The senior converted two three-pointers in overtime, one in each period, including the go-ahead bucket with 4:38 to play in the second extra frame. From there, thanks to one layup apiece from rookie point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore wing Wesley Saunders along with four free throws, Harvard was at last able to hold its lead, closing the contest with a seven-point advantage.“It was a little tighter than we’d like it to be, but we were able to pull out the victory,” said Saunders, who finished the game with a team-high 18 points. “Same thing as always, we got out early and let them back into the game.”On Feb. 12, 2011, the eventual Ivy League co-champion Crimson team found itself down by 22 points against an underdog Bears team that had just two wins after its first eight Ivy contests. But after a second half in which Harvard outscored Brown by a whopping 54-25 margin, the Crimson was back on top, 85-78, by the game’s end.
Webster—who also played an instrumental role in Harvard’s recent comeback victory over Dartmouth—had a team-high 18 points and four treys in the second half of that contest.“Christian makes some big shots for us all the time,” Saunders said. “He’s just been clutch for us this whole season. We look for him whenever we need a shot, and he’s been able to knock them down.”GOING, GOING, GONFor the second time in his career, Chambers finished with a double-double Saturday night, contributing an impressive 17 points and 10 assists. But according to Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, the freshman’s defense on Brown guard Sean McGonagill was instrumental to the success of his Crimson squad.“[Chambers’] defense was the key for us, that he was able to defend McGonagill so many times,” Amaker said. “He is very good and crafty, and for Siyani to stay in front of him as much as he did, to me, was the key to the game.”Though McGonagill ended the contest with 20 points—including the game-tying bucket with one second remaining in regulation—Chambers and the Crimson kept his Bears’ counterpart out of the action for much of the game.In the first half, McGonagill, who averages 14.7 points per game, was held to two points until just 5:41 remained in the period, during which time the junior converted a three-pointer and a layup to close out the half. Chambers led his team in scoring during the frame, chipping in 14 points.McGonagill upped his point total to 20 in the second frame on four-of-six shooting but was unable to convert in the extra session. The guard recorded two assists but was held scoreless during the final 10 minutes of the extended game.FOUL PLAYSaturday night’s contest featured an inordinate number of free throw attempts, as the two teams exchanged hacks toward the hectic end of the contest. By the game’s end, the Bears had been whistled 23 times while the Crimson was called for 19 fouls of their own.

After cutting an early 11-point deficit to two at the half, the Harvard women’s basketball team rolled over Brown (7-11, 1-3 Ivy), 68-58, to sweep its first Ivy League road trip on Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center. The Crimson hadn’t beaten both Yale and Brown on the road in three years.Harvard (12-6, 3-1 Ivy) was bolstered by a combined 33 points from backcourt pair Christine Clark and Victoria Lippert and a near double-double from sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who chipped in 14 points and nine rebounds of her own, in addition to collecting a team-high four steals. Fagbenle led the effort on the glass throughout the game, as no player from the Bears was able to grab more than four boards of their own.“We can always count on [Fagbenle] to go out and give us the best game,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “It’s great playing with her. I love it.”The first five minutes saw the two teams knot the score at 11 before a layup from Brown junior guard Lauren Clarke gave the Bears a lead they would hold until the 1:52 mark in the first half. Clarke was the leading scorer for the night, netting 20 points, including 12 from behind the arc on 50 percent three-point shooting.  Clarke was followed by guard Sophie Bikofsky as the only member of the team to break double digits in points scored, with 13 on the night.Brown co-captain Sheila Dixon, the team’s second leading scorer at 11.9 points per contest, was held to just two points on 1-for-9 shooting. Overall, the Bears shot 19-for-53 from the floor, a 36 percent clip.
After Brown forward Jordin Juker sunk two from the charity strip and put her team up 28-17 with 8:08 to go in the first frame, Harvard junior Elise Gordon took a handoff from Clark and drove to the bucket for a layup that spurred a scoring effort, as senior Elle Hagedorn drilled a three to tie the score at 33.  The Crimson entered the locker room down by 2, 35-33, after a quick layup from Bikofsky put the Bears back on top.Returning to the floor in the second stanza, Lippert sunk an early three to give Harvard its first lead since the first minute of the game. Two jumpers from Curtis put the Crimson on top, 40-37, with over 17 minutes to play. From there, Harvard would never trail again.“I think people who were in the final minutes did a really good job defensively,” Curtis said. “We got good offense off of our defensive pressure. We picked up the pressure and put Brown back on their heels. I think that we just had the mentality of ‘we have to win this game, we’re not going to lose,’ and I think that those people coming into and out of the game were doing a great job of that.”Fagbenle notched 10 of her points and six rebounds in the second half. The forward, who put up a career-high 20 points against Yale on Friday night, has been the team’s leading rebounder in eight of the last nine games.The Crimson squad hit 12 free throws in a half where its lead was as large as 14 with under a minute remaining. The team’s final 11 points were entirely off of foul shots. Through the game, Harvard shot 14-for-21 from the charity stripe.“Brown was down and they knew they had to foul,” Curtis said. “I think our team did a good job of taking care of the ball, being strong, allowing it to foul and knocking down the free throws. It comes down to the very end of the game. We practice free throws in practice, and that’s our job. We have to do that.”It was another strong night for Harvard’s bench players. The four women who hit the floor off the bench combined for 15 points. The night before, at Yale, five non-starters pitched in 24 total.“In practice we don’t really have the first string-second string,” Gordon said. “It’s the starters, and then everybody else is working just as hard too. As hard as you work, you’re making your teammates better too. We all make each other better in practice, and it only helps us to make us better in the games and on the court.”—Staff writer Cordelia F. Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu.

While most non-athletes are gradually easing back into the swing of classes and schoolwork, winter-sport athletes have been on the grind and back in Boston for a while now. It’s getting down to the wire as some winter sports face some tough tests towards the end of their schedule. How have they been faring recently? How's on the rise and who's stock is falling? The Back Page will take a look at who’s hot and who’s not as we head into the critical final weeks of the winter season.<a name=""jump"">
Onwards and Upwards:
Women’s Track and Field:
Freshman Martina Salander placed second at the Texas A&amp;M Invitational, breaking a school record in the process. She became the first Crimson athlete to top the 4,000 point mark, placing in the top three in each event. In sprints, the 4x400 meter relay team, won the Terrier Invitational, topping a field of over 40 competitors.
Men’s Basketball:
While last Saturday’s contest against Dartmouth was certainly not the best game of the season for Harvard, during the final three minutes of regulation and the overtime period the Crimson were lights out, making up a thirteen point deficit to eventually win by five and remain undefeated in conference play. This weekend, the Crimson hosted Yale and Brown in an Ivy League double header and came away victorious in both contests, though not without some more overtime drama.
Hit or Miss:
Women’s Basketball:
After a three game winning streak to start the new year, the Crimson lost a league contest against Dartmouth. After a blowout win against the Big Green at home on January 12, Harvard travelled to Andover and lost in a low scoring affair. The Crimson failed to put up at least 60 points for the first time this season. But Harvard rebounded nicely with back-to-back road wins this weekend against Yale and Brown.
Women’s Hockey:
The Crimson had not lost in 14 games until Clarkson upset it 3-1 last weekend. However, the next day, Harvard bounced back, beating St. Lawrence 3-2 in overtime. The Crimson, who were previously ranked second in the country, dropped one spot to No. 3 in the standings. For the season, they boast an impressive 17-2-2 record, trailing only Minnesota and Boston College in the polls. On Friday, though, Harvard travelled to Dartmouth for a league contest, only to come away with a tie. It was a tough blow in their final contest before the Beanpot.
Stock Falling
Men’s Hockey: Facing myriad injuries, the Crimson, who started the season highly ranked, has lost six straight and ten of eleven. The potential is there, however, as shown by an overtime win against now No. 11 Boston University. But in their final tune-up before the Beanpot, Harvard was shut out, 3-0, by Rensselaer. They now face No. 5 Boston College on Monday. If the Crimson can pull of the upset, it will give the so far disappointing season a whole new flavor.

Crimson wasn’t able to stem Crimson Tide as the Harvard men’s tennis team (2-2) fell to the University of Alabama (6-1), 4-1, at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Sunday. The loss followed the Crimson’s a 4-0 sweep of St. John’s (0-5) to open the day.Co-captain Andy Nguyen captured the sole singles victory against the Crimson Tide and teamed up with freshman Nicky Hu at the No. 2 position to win the tiebreaker for the doubles point against the Red Storm.St. John’s opened the afternoon with the pair of sophomore Mark Mozer and rookie Michael-John Every dispatching Harvard’s freshman Conor Haughey and sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri, 8-6, in the No. 3 slot. Playing at No. 1, sophomore tandem Denis Nguyen and Alex Steinroeder responded by edging seniors Valentin Mihai and Mike Lampa, 9-8, with a 7-5 tiebreaker. The pressure was then on Nguyen and Hu to deliver to capture the doubles point for the Crimson.“It was a really close match,” Hu said. “Early on in all three of the doubles matches we had, we got down early and it wasn’t looking very bright. Their teams were playing really well.”Hu and Nguyen held on to defeat senior Vasko Mladenov and sophomore Hugo Morth, 9-8, with a 10-8 tiebreaker and take the opening point for Harvard.
“The last game of the match, we ended up winning that point on deuce,” Hu said. “It gave us a little bit of momentum going to the tiebreaker at seven-all. At tiebreak we saved a couple more match points, and Andy came up with a couple big shots that gave us momentum going into the tiebreak where we saved two or three match points, and they saved two or three match points before we finally won it.”Starting singles play, No. 2 Shaun Chaudhari took his match with Mihai in straight sets, 6-0, 6-2, to give Harvard a 2-0 advantage.“My main goal was playing consistent,” Chaudhari said. “Not really going for too much but just kind of playing my game and playing a solid match.”The Crimson reached a 3-0 edge as No. 1 Denis Nguyen downed Mladenov, 6-3, 6-4. Harvard clinched the match with a win from freshman Kelvin Lam. While Lam easily took the first set, 6-1, Morth rallied to take the second, but Lam prevailed in the third, 7-6.Harvard’s evening match-up proved more challenging. Alabama, which opened its day with a 5-2 victory over Cornell, jumped to an early lead in doubles play.Tide junior Carlos Taborga and sophomore Philippe Tsangarides defeated Haughey and Lam at the No. 3 spot, 8-4. Their teammates, Jarryd Botha, ranked No. 79 in the country, and freshman Becker O’Shaughnessey, took down Denis Nguyen and Steinroeder, 8-5.Alabama continued to dominate in singles.  The Tide opened with junior Daniil Proskura defeating Steinroeder at No. 3, 6-3, 6-3. Botha followed up with a win over Chaudhuri. While the first set stayed tight, the Tide senior dismantled Chaudhuri in the second, 6-3.“It was a tough match,” Chaudhari said. “They’re a great team, and they all fought really hard. We just came up a little short that day.”While Alabama led the match, 3-0, all was not lost for Harvard, as Andy Nguyen nearly blanked his opponent, sophomore David Vieyra, in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2. Nguyen was the only player from the Crimson to put up points against the Tide.At the No. 1 position, Denis Nguyen battled O’Shaughnessey with the chance for Harvard to hold on in the contest and push it to six matches. Nguyen took the first set, 6-4, but was barely edged in the next two, 7-5, 7-6(2).“Overall it was a good day for us,” Hu said. “We played the entire day very shorthanded. A lot of our team has been injured at the beginning of this season but for what we had we did really well…. Although we lost, we took something positive out of it because everybody fought really hard.“Injuries, which have plagued the team for the whole season, are something Harvard hopes to avoid as it nears the start of Ivy League play.“We were shorthanded,” Hu said. “Not because everyone is injured to the point where they can’t play, but to the point where we believe it’s not worth it to put people out there because they could seriously injure themselves. We know the most important time is going to be the Ivy League season, and when that comes around, we want everyone to be one hundred percent healthy and one hundred percent ready to take it.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

Ever wondered what the differences between squash and tennis are? Fear not, The Crimson has got you covered. In this new series, The Back Page takes a look at some things you might not know about squash—and some reasons why you should check out some of the top teams in the nation, right here at the Murr Center.<a name=""jump"">
5) Ball Warmers?
Yep, you read that correctly. Because of the rubber compound from which it is made, cold squash balls tend to “die” quickly due to a lack of bounce, while warmer balls bounce higher, allowing the ball to come up to be hit. Thus, especially for less experienced players who can’t hit the ball hard enough to achieve an optimal temperature, a ball warmer must be used. These handy devices are surprisingly easy to find—<a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/Jet-Bounce-Squash-Ball-Warmer-/230852595531"">available for just $9.99 on eBay.
4) Listen for the Tin
 Unlike tennis, which has a net to stop play, a squash court is an open area for play. But on the front wall of a squash court, the bottom 18 inches, called the tin, acts like a net. Other than the serve, where the ball must go about the middle line on the front wall, every ball hit to the front wall must go above the 18-inch mark. If not, a clanking sound will indicate a point for the other player and a downed ball.
3) Lucky Eleven
 While 25 is the number to reach for volleyball, squash players search for the number 11 to light up the scoreboard, usually indicating the end of a game, where three won games clinch the match. Similar to a set of tennis, a player must be up by at least two points in a game order to call a victory. In an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/20/harvard-womens-squash-amherst-hamilton/"">earlier shutout against Amherst, ninth-seeded Georgina Brinkley played to a 17-15 win of her second game.
2) A Lot on the Line
 Sure, squash shares many similarities to other racquet-swinging sports, but in one way, it bears more resemblance to basketball. In both sports, lines are important—so much so, that in tennis, there is a <a href=""http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/page/sports-officiating/tennis"">software solely designed to determine whether the ball did, in fact, touch the line. But where in tennis, the ball is considered ‘in’ if it touches any part of the white line, a squash ball that hits a line is considered out.
1) Squashing the Competition
 Although this fast-paced sport may make knowing when to clap a little confusing, be rest assured that the Murr Center will give you something to cheer about. The men’s team is No. 3 in the nation while the women’s team is ranked second overall, making it the only Crimson sport to possess two teams within the top three of the nation. If that isn’t enough to convince you to make the trek across the river, Harvard’s teams also hold the top-ranked individual players in the nation in Ali Farag and Amanda Sobhy, both of who have yet to lose a match this season.

The Super Bowl is upon us, and, trust me, there is nothing super about being called out for knowing nothing about America's number one pastime. So to help you watch the funny commercials in peace, here is some advice on how to look like you understand the game.<!--more--> 1. Avoid Big Words Touch-down, first-down, nice play? The football lexicon can get kind of confusing. So to avoid utter embarrassment it is best to avoid technical terms when commenting on the game. I recommend the general grunt and howl. Instead of showing your ignorance by using actual English, try throwing your beer on the floor and yelling obscenities in foreign languages. If you do it right, people won’t know if you are cheering, booing, or experiencing a mild form of cardiac arrest.  
2. Change the SubjectAt the risk of upsetting any real fans—or inviting any questions—don't root for a team. When people ask you who you are cheering for, nod enthusiastically and change the subject to the salsa selection. Did you try the artichoke dip? If there is no salsa selection leave the party. There is nothing keeping you there.  3. Follow a Fan To look like you are paying attention, simply choose another fan and mimic everything she does the entire game. When he cheers, you cheer, when she cries, you cry, when he dips, you dip. Things might get awkward when you follow him into the bathroom, so just make sure to wash your hands.  4. Memorize a Statistic Have an impressive statistic on hand so that if anyone talks to you, you have something to say. For example when someone asks you who you think will win or what you did over break try saying something along the lines of ""In 2012 49er player Tarell Brown had one interception"" or try this this gem, ""Edgar Allen Poe wrote 'The Raven' in 1845.""

UPDATED: February 4, 2013, at 5:37 p.m.Venture capitalist James W. Breyer was elected to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/02/breyer_elected/"">Harvard announced Monday. He will become the organization’s thirteenth member on July 1.The Corporation, which is the oldest corporate body in the western hemisphere, elected Breyer to the position on Sunday with approval from the Board of Overseers—Harvard’s other governing board.The addition of Breyer, a managing partner at Accel Partners who graduated from Harvard Business School in 1987, will mark the completion of the Harvard Corporation’s <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/12/6/corporation-members-university-governance/"">expansion from 7 to 13 members—a piece of the governance reforms that were adopted in 2010 in an effort to increase the transparency and accountability of the group, while also making it more similar in structure to the governance bodies of other universities. In addition to expanding the size of the Corporation for the first time in its more than 300-year history, the reforms imposed six-year term limits on members and created several new subcommittees.“I’m honored by this opportunity to serve a university that blends tradition in such meaningful, powerful ways,” Breyer said in a press release. “I’m excited at the prospect of working with [University President Drew G. Faust] and my future Corporation colleagues to help cultivate the spirit of curiosity and aspiration that, for me, defines Harvard.”
Breyer was formerly the chairman of the National Venture Capital Association and is currently a director at Dell, Inc. He has served on the boards of News Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Marvel Entertainment, and several other companies.Breyer is a trustee of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and owns a minority share of the Boston Celtics. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/profile/jim-breyer/"">Forbes magazine estimates his net worth at $1.1 billion as of March 2012.Breyer is also active at Harvard, serving as a member of Harvard’s Global Advisory Council and as chair of the Business School’s California Research Center. According to the press release, he “informally advised” the University on edX, a virtual learning initiative <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/2/mit-edx-virtual-online/"">launched by Harvard and MIT last year.Faust and the Corporation’s senior fellow Robert D. Reischauer ’63 praised Breyer for his innovative and entrepreneurial skills in the press release.“Jim Breyer is one of his generation’s most creative and admired venture capitalists,” they said. “Beyond his professional pursuits, he has a deep commitment to the liberal arts, an imaginative perspective on the potential of technology to enhance education, and strong interests in modern and contemporary art, music, film, and photography. We very much look forward to welcoming him to the Corporation.”—Staff writer Samuel Y. Weinstock can be reached at sweinstock@college.harvard.edu.

Harvard’s endowment returns beat the national average for American colleges and universities during the 2012 fiscal year, according to a study released Friday by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and the Commonfund Institute.Harvard’s returns <a href="" http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/27/endowment-dips-slightly/"">dropped .05 percent during the last fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2012, but were still higher than the nationwide average. The endowments of 831 colleges and universities, including Harvard, experienced average returns of -.3 percent in the 2012 fiscal year, according to the study.That figure represents a significant decrease from the 2011 fiscal year when educational endowments saw returns of 19.2 percent. That year, Harvard’s endowment <a href="" http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/9/22/hmc-endowment-returns-2011/"">grew by 21.4 percent.“While investment performance over the last twelve months was well below long-term averages, we nevertheless found good investment opportunities through both internal and external management that we believe will sow the seeds for future growth,” Harvard Management Company President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said in a press release when Harvard released its<a href="" http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/27/endowment-dips-slightly/""> 2012 endowment figures.Although Harvard’s losses in 2012 beat the national average, they were less consistent with the average returns on larger endowments. According to the study, schools with endowments valuing $1 billion or more experienced average returns of .8 percent.
In terms of total market value, which takes into account investment returns along with deposits and withdrawals, Harvard’s endowment dropped 4.1 percent but still remained by far the largest in the world at $30.7 billion. Yale University’s endowment, which at $19.3 billion is the second largest in the country, held steady in the 2012 fiscal year with a market value loss of only .1 percent.Harvard’s below-average returns last year can be explained in part by the particularly poor performance of international equities, in which Harvard heavily invests. Foreign investments experienced an 11.8 percent loss, according to the NACUBO-Commonfund study, which also broke down endowment returns by asset class.NACUBO and the Commonfund Institute both conduct research on higher education and release a joint report on university endowments annually.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.

This past Friday, five students met with members of the Harvard Corporation to take the next steps in actualizing a social choice fund. This rare meeting between the Corporation and students arose after Harvard <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">announced that it would create a social choice fund in December. Resulting from the successful campaign for a social choice fund organized by the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, this announcement is a positive affirmation that the University is willing to support the student body’s voiced desire to move towards more socially responsible investment practices. The Crimson has consistently <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/16/Crimson-fair-harvard/"">expressed strong support for the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition and likewise welcomes the University’s commitment to creating a social choice fund.  We urge the University to ensure that the new social choice fund is sustainable and to work towards expanding the fund in the future.Although the University only announced the formation of the social choice fund this past December, the move toward responsible investing at Harvard has been long in the making. In 1972, Harvard President Derek C. Bok created the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility in response to widespread campaigns to divest from Apartheid South Africa.  These two committees work in tandem to evaluate shareholder resolutions on the social responsibility of Harvard’s investments.  Yet it was only this past year under the tutelage of the Responsible Investment at Harvard campaign that students were able to convince these committees to support the creation of a separate social choice fund.  This decision came about largely because of the strong show of student support for the fund, demonstrated through more than $11,000 of donations made to the <a href=""https://www.wepay.com/donations/fairharvard"">Fair Harvard Fund, organized by the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, and the student body’s overwhelming support for the social choice fund in this past fall’s Undergraduate Council election.All parties involved are enthusiastic about the University’s decision to establish a social choice fund that will begin accepting contributions in July. However, the wariness of some of the Coalition’s members to fully uphold the University’s approach to the social choice fund may be warranted. The University has <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">stipulated that 20 percent of the fund’s initial value will be allocated to fund student financial aid. Although this is a certainly an admirable gesture, the removal of such a large percentage of the fund annually might stymie its growth. Furthermore, the Harvard Management Company intends to have a separate mutual fund manage the money in the fund, preventing the HMC from gaining valuable experience operating the normal endowment and the social choice fund side by side. Furthermore, Responsible Investment at Harvard has voiced concerns over the transparency of the investments.To address these concerns, students should remain actively involved in the social choice fund and urge the University to administer the fund responsibly and publicize the fund to alumni and the greater Harvard community in order to ensure its future growth. The students who rallied for divestment from Apartheid decades ago and from oil companies in Darfur in 2005 would be proud to be a part of this historical moment. Now it is our job to continue to provide the necessary support and oversight for the fledgling fund in the coming years.

During a long, cold December bus ride to Logan airport, I thought about home. I thought about Harvard. And I thought about what the difference was.It was the beginning of winter break, and I was heading back through the rainy Boston air to the place I grew up in, near Los Angeles, where the only regular precipitation comes from child actors who cry over the absence of FIJI water in their trailers (these are called “El Spoiled Niño” storms or “Temperature Tantrums”). In Southern California, winter is summer, fall is summer, spring is summer, and Summer is the name of every bikini-clad girl tanning along the shoreline. After a semester of being introduced to new concepts like “snow,” “sweaters,” and “visible breath,” I couldn’t wait to get back.I flew in late, drove for a while, and slept on my old bed. Once I awoke, I rushed to the window in hopes that a beautiful floating ball of hot plasma would greet me with its warmth once again. I closed my eyes, threw open the shades, and looked out. Darkness. Clouds. Rain. Misery.The sight warmed my heart.There’s something different about Southern California rain—it’s comforting. In my suburban hometown of Thousand Oaks, it trickles over the hills and valleys. They are covered in light shadows, and the streets become paved in the gritty shine of wetness. The air grows cool and smells fresh and sweet as people fill it with ridiculous complaints about how they have to rewash their SUVs because of the rain. On the other hand, rain at Harvard is an annoying normality. It just makes the elegance of the Yard and Square seem kind of dirty.
Small things about a community, like the rain, are different at Harvard than at other places. And first-year students like myself, many traveling home for the first time this past month since leaving for college, reflect on those differences and on whether Harvard can be considered a second home.  There are many comparisons, but the most important aspect of a community (or home) is the people. I feel at home with Southern Californians. For the most part, they are all warm, friendly and, like I said before, named Summer, which is a very pretty name for both genders. But the people at Harvard, each coming from such <a href=""http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/about/index.html"">different backgrounds geographically, ethnically, academically, racially or otherwise, are harder to characterize. And as if that wasn’t tricky enough, each has also stood out as students and citizens from their backgrounds; there aren’t any “stock characters” defined by their community. In that sense, Cambridge becomes a place to go for people who don’t quite fit in—a home for the homeless—which is kind of what it already <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/column/talk-to-the-hand/article/2012/10/18/harvard-square-homeless/"">was.So, Harvard students go into freshman year sharing just a few qualities—intellectual curiosity, a motivation to succeed, and what seems like a fetish-level fascination for boat shoes. But they don’t share much else.  Unlike the homes they come from, not everyone has grown up together in similar circumstances. Student groups are often at odds with one another. Conversations can get awkward fast. Regional words like “hella” and “wicked” quickly become weird and then faux pas. Some freshman rooming groups fit together like peas in a missile pod, choosing never to talk to one another. Overall, not much meshes together very well.The result can sometimes feel like Harvard is a collection rather than a community—an active museum where the students, rare finds in themselves, all share the same space (most of which does look like museum space) while doing their own activities and following their own pursuits. It often seems like everyone is too busy being talented or achieving something to go for a day trip to Boston or play a game of touch football. And that disjointedness doesn’t always feel too homey.But that disjointedness is actually what can make it homey. The fact that not everyone fits together nicely defines Harvard as a community. One reason the admissions office tries to create a diverse class is because research shows students <a href=""http://www.ur.umich.edu/9899/Mar22_99/10.htm"">learn better in diverse communities. And that’s because we learn from the ways in which we don’t fit together, and those awkward connections can lead to unlikely, deep, and funny interactions between friends who, against all odds, were brought together by the College. Everyone and every day is different. Just like the rain in Southern California, it’s a nice surprise—a homey one.As I moved back into the dorm this past week for the coming semester, I looked out the window. Darkness. Clouds. Snow. Misery. Students were plopping back on campus as the snow accumulated at their feet. I turned back inside. Some of my entryway-mates—one a New York dancer and rower, one a flautist, one a pundit, one an aspiring science writer, and the list goes on—were having a long, tantalizing conversation about nothing. I looked back through the window at the freezing rain with a confused look on my face. My friend said, “That’s called a ‘flurry,’ Dash.” Another new word. I smiled.Harvard is many things. For some it’s a prestigious, multicultural, intellectual, and self-absorbed institution for new and old elites. For others it’s just another liberal arts college. But for me, and I’m sure for many other freshman and upperclassmen coming back for another semester, it’s a second, rainy home.Dashiell F.

Twenty years ago, Harvard captain Ted Drury ’93 accepted a 26-pound, 14-inch trophy at center ice of the old Boston Garden after a 4-2 triumph over Boston University. Few players on that 1992-93 Crimson squad may have guessed back then just how unusual such an accomplishment would become for the Harvard men’s hockey team.The Crimson has not collected the two wins needed for a Beanpot title since 1993. In 2013, Harvard (5-14-1, 3-12 ECAC) will be lucky to escape with one. As the puck drops on the 61st Annual Beanpot today, the Crimson will attempt to halt a seven-game losing skid against defending NCAA champion Boston College (15-7-2, 9-4-1 HE).The Harvard men’s hockey team has lost 11 of its last 12 and has not won in regulation since Nov. 16. The Crimson’s last victory came early last month in a come-from-behind, overtime thriller against No. 9/11 Boston University, which will face Northeastern in the Beanpot’s other first-round match-up.Tonight will be Harvard’s first meeting with No. 5 Boston College since the first round of the 2010 Beanpot, in which the Eagles defeated the Crimson, 6-0. Boston College has won three straight Beanpots and four of the last five.“They’ve got a lot of speed, a good offensive attack and a good goalie,” senior forward Luke Greiner said of Boston College.
That pretty good goalie is senior Parker Milner. Last season, Milner picked up NCAA tournament MVP honors as the backstop during a 19-game winning streak for the Eagles that spanned from the 2012 Beanpot to the NCAA final.“He’s really calm in the net and steady back there,” senior forward Connor Morrison said of Milner. “He’s got a lot of experience.”Boston College will also arrive at TD Garden today with plenty of firepower on the other end of the rink. Sophomore forward Johnny Gaudreau leads the Hockey East in scoring with 33 points in 21 games. Senior forwards Pat Mullane and Steven Whitney also ranking among the top-20 Division I scorers.“[Mullane] is going to make smart decisions with the puck; he’s a great playmaker, good scorer, too, so he’s a dangerous guy,” Morrison said. “Gaudreau is a smaller guy, but he’s quick. He’s really good on his edges.”Harvard enters Monday last in the ECAC, four points shy of second-worst Cornell. The Crimson’s record has not been much better against Hockey East teams. Before Harvard won at Boston University last month, Northeastern and UMass-Lowell had dealt the Crimson blowout losses.Harvard will have to elevate its play on special teams tonight as the Crimson confronts some statistical mismatches. Boston College enters Monday ranked 15th and 10th in Division I on the power play and penalty kill, respectively. Harvard currently ranks 58th and 52nd in those departments. Only Maine has had less success with the man advantage.“The good thing about [Monday] is that it’s just one game,” Morrison said. “Numbers tell a lot, but you never know how things are going to go.“Obviously, they have a good power play; they’ve got some dangerous guys out there, and we’re going to have to pressure them. We can’t give those guys a whole lot of time. And as far as the power play, we’re going to have to simplify things and get pucks to the net and see if we can’t bang home a few lucky ones,” Morrison added.Despite Harvard’s recent struggles, Greiner remains optimistic as he prepares to suit up for his fourth and final Beanpot. After all, it’s just two games.“We’re excited going into it,” Greiner said. “We believe we have a shot to win it all.”The Crimson last advanced to the Beanpot final in 2008, where Harvard faced the Eagles. Boston College led, 5-3, with ten minutes left in regulation before goals from Jon Pelle ‘08 and Mike Taylor ‘08 forced overtime. But a game-winner from Nick Petreck in the extra fram gave the Eagles the final edge.Now, with an entirely new generation of players at the helm, the Crimson will have to push hard to compete for the gilded bean pot. Just one game stands between Harvard and the grandest stage in New England intercollegiate hockey.“I think we need to lay it all on the line,” Greiner said. “I don’t think it’s about one key thing or technical aspect. I think it’s just about playing for the guys to the right and left of you and going out there and using what we’ve got.”—Staff writer Michael D.

Riding a three-match win streak, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team took on two conference opponents this weekend in No. 11 Columbia and No. 5 Cornell at the Murr Center.The Crimson (13-1, 4-1 Ivy) handily defeated the Lions, 8-1, on Saturday afternoon. Harvard did not suffer a letdown the next day, going on to dispatch the Big Red on Sunday, 6-3.The Crimson’s last conference game came against Princeton on Jan. 13, where Harvard fell in a tight, 5-4 decision.“Today everyone played well, because we could have easily lost had we played the same way as we did [in our earlier loss] against Princeton,” sophomore Tyler Olson said. “I think it shows character that we came back and everyone played well and put it together.”HARVARD 6, CORNELL 3
In its second conference showdown in as many days, Harvard edged out a 6-3 victory over Cornell (12-3, 3-2).The Big Red, which had won seven of its last eight matches with the sole loss coming to No. 2 Trinity, made things tough on the Crimson. Only two matches were decided in straight sets, and they both went down as Harvard victories.“Cornell today, especially the men, were bloody good,” said Crimson coach Mike Way, who also coaches the women’s side. “And for us to win, 6-3, it might have been 7-2 but could easily have been 5-4. Either way, some of the matches were that close.”Junior defending national champion Ali Farag was responsible for one of those three-set victories, once again dispatching his opponent in convincing fashion. Farag has never lost in his Harvard career.The other sweep came at the No. 8 position. Senior Jason Michas secured a convincing win, but each set was decided by three points or fewer.None of the other Crimson wins came easily, as three of the victories came in four sets and one went the full five-set distance.“I thought that a couple of our guys might reflect and wish they had done things a little bit differently, but overall we should be well pleased with how they played,” Way said. “They played terrific squash.”Junior Tommy Mullaney demonstrated his resilience at the No. 6 position. After dropping the first two games, Mullaney came back to win the final three sets, each by just two points.Fellow juniors Brandon McLaughlin and Gary Power, along with freshman Matt Roberts, all achieved comeback victories against the Big Red. Each player dropped the first set but stormed back to win the next three games.McLaughlin especially turned the tide, as the junior stormed back to take the final two sets by scores of 11-2 and 11-4.

The Harvard men’s volleyball team sure didn’t look like it belonged in the hall of fame in its first game on Friday against Loyola. But after two consecutive losses—one against the Ramblers and another the week before against No. 6 Penn State—the Crimson bounced back to finish its weekend victorious.The team traveled across the state to Springfield, Mass. to take on Loyola (6-5) and Juniata (4-2) in the Hall of Fame Morgan Classic, hosted by Springfield College. Harvard (5-2, 1-1 EIVA) split its matches on the weekend, as the Crimson downed the Eagles in the consolation match, 3-1, after the Ramblers bested Harvard in the same number of sets.“I thought that we played pretty well this weekend, but we definitely could have played a lot better,” said freshman outside hitter Branden Clemens. “We didn’t have our best game against Loyola. We could have served better and played better overall defense. I just thought that we were playing kind of sloppy compared to how we played last week up against Penn State.”In the loss against the Nittany Lions last week, the Crimson suffered another setback—the loss of DJ White, the team’s leader in points per set, to an injury that will bench the sophomore outside hitter for a couple of weeks. White’s injury is something that Clemens acknowledges as a gap that the team is attempting to fill.“It’s been very different and challenging because DJ’s a leader on the court and he’s a really great player,” Clemens said. “It’s been a transitioning period because we’re trying to get used to not having him on the court. I switched over to L1 and [junior outside hitter] Mike [Owen] stepped in as L2. Mike’s been playing really great, and I think overall we’ve been trying to keep ourselves pumped and stay focused, and I think everyone’s stepped up to try to be more of a leader and pull more weight because of losing DJ.”
HARVARD 3, JUNIATA 1After losing three straight sets to Loyola the night before, the Crimson wavered in the consolation game before ultimately coming out victorious.Harvard capitalized on errors by the Eagles and only trailed once in the first set, winning it 25-16. But it looked as though the Crimson had faltered as Juniata built a seven-point lead in the second, 20-13, and never looked back, taking the set, 25-22.“I think at that point it was all mental,” said junior outside hitter Nick Madden. “It was us on our side of the net, making mistakes and errors, and we knew that if we cleaned up our serving and cleaned up our hitting errors, we’d roll over them, and that’s what we did.”Harvard led for the majority of the final two sets before winning them in decisive fashion, 25-17 and 25-13.Clemens tallied 19 kills on the night, a career-high for the rookie, while Madden registered a team-high 20. The team showed off its defense as well, as junior libero Chris Gibbons recorded 13 digs en route to holding Juniata to a 0.075 hitting percentage.LOYOLA 3, HARVARD 1The Crimson began its trip west with a turn down south as the team lost three sets after winning the first one.“I think overall, we didn’t play as well as we played during the first set,” Clemens said. “Our passing wasn’t as good, and in our attacking, we were making more errors. Their playing beefed up a lot, too, so it was kind of switched—they weren’t playing as well in the first set when we were playing well, and then after the first set, we weren’t playing as well and they stepped it up.”Harvard never trailed in the first set and looked dominant as it won, 25-16. But the tables turned on the Crimson in the next three sets as the team never managed to take a lead in the second half of any of the final sets, losing them, 18-25, 21-25, and 18-25.After losing a tough-fought match to a top-ranked team the week before, 3-2, Madden noted the disappointment of falling to a team that he thought Harvard was capable of beating.“Juniata for sure was not as good as Penn State, and I would also say that Loyola wasn’t as good as Penn State,” Madden said. “I feel like we played Penn State a lot harder—if we had played at the level that we had played with against Penn State, we would have won both games this weekend.”Clemens led the team in offense with 15 kills while Gibbons spearheaded the defensive effort with six digs.—Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samanthalin@college.harvard.edu.

Going into this weekend’s dual meet, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had never beaten Princeton at DeNunzio Pool. In fact, no Ivy League team had ever beaten out the four-time reigning Ivy League champions at home. But the Crimson was not about to let history repeat itself.With wins in 14 of the meet’s 19 events, Harvard became the first Ivy opponent to take down the Tigers in its home pool at this weekend’s annual HYP meet with a 106-80 win. The Crimson also handled Yale, 153-33, to stay perfect against league foes.“For me as a senior, and for the rest of the seniors, it was a really special thing to go into their home pool and be the first team in the Ivy League to ever beat them [there],” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “It’s something we’ve really been going for, ever since I was a freshman, but [it] eluded us.”Harvard (8-0, 6-0 Ivy), Yale (7-2, 4-2), and Princeton (5-1, 5-1) all entered the meet with perfect league records on the line. With the win, the Crimson clinched at least a share of the conference dual-meet title.“It’s just a really great way to finish a career,” Wurzbacher said. “But most importantly, it’s a huge step forward for this team. Where we’ve come from when I was a freshman to where we are now is just incredible. I’m fortunate and proud to be a part of Harvard men’s swimming and diving right now.”
Harvard got off the blocks fast this weekend, taking gold in eight of Saturday’s 10 events. Sophomore Chuck Katis started day one with wins in the 100 breast and 200 IM.“I think the team energy was the best it’s ever been,” Katis said. “The collective team energy just really helped everyone accomplish what they wanted to get out of the weekend, and I think we came out a better team.”In the final day of competition Sunday, Harvard took home the title in six more events to secure the victory.Leading the charge for the Crimson was the standout performance of Oliver Lee. The junior teamed with classmate Jack Pretto, Katis, and sophomore Griffin Schumacher to set a school record and take home gold in the 200 medley relay with a NCAA ‘B’ standard time of 1:27.18.Lee also picked up a win in the 100 free with a new personal best time of 43.29, the 10th best time in the country this season and the second best time in Harvard history.Earlier in the meet, Lee broke another school record in the 50 free with a time of 19.76, picking up another NCAA ‘B’ standard time.“Oliver was incredible,” Wurzbacher said. “He helped set the tone for the entire meet. He was aggressive and raced in an incredibly poised, powerful fashion. He was just on top of his game right from the get-go. And he set an example for the rest of the team to follow.”The Crimson’s freshman class stepped up to the challenge in their biggest dual meet of the season. First-year Christian Carbone took home first in the 400 IM with a time of 3:49.58, the fifth fastest time in program history. Classmate Steven Kekacs set a new personal best en route to a victory in the 500 free with a time of 4:26.33.“What was impressive was the way our underclassmen stepped up,” Wurzbacher said. “I think that speaks to the way our upperclassmen were able to set the tone. We had some amazing swims from some younger guys.”The Crimson hopes to ride the momentum of this weekend’s success into its final dual meet of the season next weekend against Penn and into the ECAC and Ivy League championships.“We see this as a very important step forward,” Wurzbacher said. “We have much bigger things to accomplish. Ultimately, the Ivy League championships are our goal. We are really excited about the possibilities ahead and how fast we’re going to be able to swim.”“I think everyone’s going to come back [to practice] with some fire in their eyes,” Katis said. “The next couple of weeks are very important for us, training-wise. We have a lot of great spirit going into the next few weeks, and it sets us up well to win Ivies.”The women’s swimming and diving team  also took care of business, downing Yale 209-89, and Princeton, 199-99.With the win, the Crimson improved to 9-0 in dual meets and 7-0 in the Ivy League, securing a conference championship of its own.

After cutting an early 11-point deficit to two at the half, the Harvard women’s basketball team rolled over Brown (7-11, 1-3 Ivy), 68-58, to sweep its first Ivy League road trip on Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center. The Crimson hadn’t beaten both Yale and Brown on the road in three years.Harvard (12-6, 3-1 Ivy) was bolstered by a combined 33 points from backcourt pair Christine Clark and Victoria Lippert and a near double-double from sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who chipped in 14 points and nine rebounds of her own, in addition to collecting a team-high four steals.Fagbenle led the effort on the glass throughout the game, as no players from the Bears were able to grab more than four boards of their own.“We can always count on [Fagbenle] to go out and give us the best game,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “It’s great playing with her. I love it.”The first five minutes saw the two teams knot the score at 11 before a layup from Brown junior guard Lauren Clarke gave the Bears a lead they would hold until the 1:52 mark in the first half.
Clarke was the leading scorer for the night, netting 20 points, including 12 from behind the arc on 50 percent three-point shooting.  Clarke was followed by guard Sophie Bikofsky as the only member of the team to break double digits in points scored, with 13 on the night.Brown co-captain Sheila Dixon, the team’s second leading scorer at 11.9 points per contest, was held to just two points on 1-for-9 shooting. Overall, the Bears shot 19-for-53 from the floor, a 36 percent clip.After Brown forward Jordin Juker sunk two from the charity strip and put her team up 28-17 with 8:08 to go in the first frame, Harvard junior Elise Gordon took a handoff from Clark and drove to the bucket for a layup that spurred a scoring effort, as senior Elle Hagedorn drilled a three to tie the score at 33.The Crimson entered the locker room down by two, 35-33, after a quick layup from Bikofsky put the Bears back on top.Returning to the floor in the second stanza, Lippert sunk an early three to give Harvard its first lead since the first minute of the game. Two jumpers from Curtis put the Crimson on top, 40-37, with over 17 minutes to play. From there, Harvard would never trail again.“I think people who were in the final minutes did a really good job defensively,” Curtis said. “We got good offense off of our defensive pressure. We picked up the pressure and put Brown back on their heels. I think that we just had the mentality of ‘we have to win this game, we’re not going to lose,’ and I think that those people coming into and out of the game were doing a great job of that.”Fagbenle notched 10 of her points and six rebounds in the second half. The forward, who put up a career-high 20 points against Yale on Friday night, has been the team’s leading rebounder in eight of the last nine games.The Crimson squad hit 12 free throws in a half where its lead was as large as 14 with under a minute remaining.The team’s final 11 points were entirely off of foul shots. Harvard shot 14-for-21 from the charity stripe in the contest.“Brown was down and they knew they had to foul,” Curtis said. “I think our team did a good job of taking care of the ball, being strong, allowing it to foul and knocking down the free throws. It comes down to the very end of the game. We practice free throws in practice, and that’s our job. We have to do that.”It was another strong night for Harvard’s bench players. The four women who hit the floor off the bench combined for 15 points. The night before, at Yale, five non-starters pitched in 24 combined.“In practice we don’t really have the first string-second string,” Gordon said. “It’s the starters, and then everybody else is working just as hard too. As hard as you work, you’re making your teammates better too. We all make each other better in practice, and it only helps us to make us better in the games and on the court.”—Staff writer Cordelia F. Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu.

Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle led the Crimson (11-6, 2-1 Ivy) to a 67-54 win over Yale (6-11, 1-2 Ivy), registering a career-high 20 points in New Haven on Friday. The game was Harvard’s first conference road trip of the season.After Harvard took an early lead, the Bulldogs looked to lessen the deficit heading into the second half, but the Crimson caught another quick wind and ended the game with a 43.8 shooting percentage. The Yale offense consistently failed to find the basket throughout the match, going 20 for 72. By the end of the first frame, the Bulldogs had put up a low 19.4 shooting percentage.“We’ve been working really hard,” junior center Elise Gordon said. “We’ve been working on our different defenses, so the fact that we have such a variety of defenses that we can use makes [our opponents] have to counteract, which is definitely to our advantage.”Fagbenle and Gordon pressured Yale early on in the first frame, scoring several  points in the paint after the opening tipoff. Harvard held a double-digit lead for the majority of the period and led the Bulldogs at halftime, 32-20.“Temi is a great player,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “She’s awesome to play with and I think [at] Yale having 20 points as her career high is a great building block for her, and I think that’s going to motivate her during the rest of the Ivy League games.”
The second period brought tighter competition, with Yale closing the gap to three points in the final 14 minutes. The Crimson defense buckled down and finished the game with a season-high 50 rebounds.“We had a couple of games where we haven’t been able to overcome adversity, and what we really wanted to focus on was  [playing] possession by possession and basically just converting on offense,” Gordon said. “We would make goals for ourselves and just be one play ahead.Fagbenle chipped in nine rebounds and a steal of her own, while co-captain forward Miriam Rutzen and junior guard Christine Clark had a combined rebound total of 14, registering seven apiece.“I think Yale especially was a really good team effort,” Curtis said. “I thought during Yale we did a good job of defending the following side against the post. They were playing pretty tough on our guards.”The Harvard bench showed out with a total of 24 points, while Yale’s bench only registered eight. Rutzen, Curtis, and junior forward Missy Mullens tallied two assists each for the Crimson.“Our team has so many weapons,” Gordon said. “We’ve got a really deep bench.”Despite a Bulldogs rally in the second half, exceeding their first-period point total by 14, the Crimson headed to the locker room with a comfortable lead. Harvard held off the Yale second-period run that defeated the Crimson during the 2011-12 season.“We kept padding it inside, getting inside-out looks, and I think Elise executed really well on a lot of those, as well as a lot of other players that came off the bench and really contributed to the team effort,” Curtis said.After Fagbenle, Gordon registered the highest number of points at 10, while Curtis and senior guard Elle Hagedorn chipped in nine and eight points, respectively.Fagbenle recently received her sixth Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor this week. The sophomore has racked in a total of eight Ancient Eight awards on the season. The forward also registered nine rebounds, one assist, one block, and one steal in under 22 minutes.Yale’s final 27.8 shooting percentage marked the lowest of a Harvard opponent since the Crimson played against TCU in early January. The bulldogs never led Harvard by more than three points during the matchup.—Staff writer Kelley Guinn McCartor can be reached at kelleyguinnmcartor@college.harvard.edu.

For the second consecutive weekend, the No. 3/4 Harvard women’s hockey team went up against a formidable conference opponent on the road. And for the second consecutive weekend, it played its foe to a disappointing result. Just a week after falling to No. 6 Clarkson, the Crimson failed to earn a win as the squad played Dartmouth to a 2-2 draw in Hanover.“It’s probably the best we played as a group in a couple of weeks,” junior forward Lindsey Fry said. “We were bummed to get the tie, but we weren’t disappointed in our performance necessarily.”The third-ranked team in the nation traded goals with a Big Green side that hasn’t dropped a game at home since Nov. 23 when No. 5 Cornell paid Hanover a visit.“That was fun,” co-captain Laura Bellamy said. “We want games like that. We want a good back-and-forth team.”Both goalies took a few minutes to settle in as three of the first four goals were scored within the first 10 minutes of play. Bellamy surrendered an early goal to Lindsey Allen off of a faceoff but soon found her rhythm to stop all but one of Dartmouth’s next 25 shots.
Bellamy has been splitting time with freshman Emerance Maschemeyer this season.  The tandem ranks first and second, respectively, in save percentage in the ECAC.The fruitless overtime period was closely contested as both teams had opportunities to find the back of the net.The Big Green’s chance came first as Laura Stacey put the puck on net. The rebound bounced its way straight to Sasha Nanji who fired the puck right into Bellamy’s midsection for the easy cover-up.Harvard came close but failed to punch it in during the closing seconds. Dartmouth’s goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft had to fall down and reach behind her in order to keep it out and make her  last of 41 saves on the night.“It can be kind of discouraging,” said Fry of the team’s difficulty finishing. “But at the same time it is so encouraging because you see how many opportunities you are getting and think one of them is bound to go in.”That was the case early as a Big Green turnover led to the game’s first scoring opportunity two minutes into the first. After being played into the corner and worked along the boards, the puck skidded to junior forward Kalley Armstrong who stickhandled her way past two defenders before abruptly directing the puck at an unsuspecting goaltender.The cushion created by the backhander did not last long as Allen’s quick strike allowed Dartmouth to draw even thereafter.The puck slid under Bellamy’s pads to find its way into the back of the net and erase the early lead.The squad’s top line, spearheaded by co-captain Jillian Dempsey, displayed its offensive prowess, accounting for both of the night’s goals. The three players who comprise the unit have combined for 36 goals thus far this season.“That line...has been great for us all year. They know where each other are at all times and that was a great play,” Bellamy said of the precision passing that allowed the Crimson to go up for the remainder of the first period.

After its last match against Ancient Eight competition ended in its first loss since the end of the 2011 season, other Ivy League opponents could have smelled blood in the water facing the No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team. But the Crimson responded to its competition by putting on two inspired performances this weekend, rolling both Empire State rivals Columbia and No. 6 Cornell, 9-0.Harvard (9-1, 4-1 Ivy) was expected to have little trouble with the Lions Saturday afternoon, as Columbia is in its second season as a varsity program. On the other hand, the Big Red came to Cambridge with plans of snagging an upset against the 2012 CSA national champions. But after a sweep of the first round of matches, led by co-captain Natasha Kingshott, the win never looked in doubt for the hosts.“Cornell is one of the strongest teams in the Ivy League, and…we knew this would be a tough match and a test to see how far we’ve come since J-Term and the tough loss to Princeton,” Kingshott said. “[With] a 9-0 sweep, I think the match score speaks for itself.”HARVARD 9, CORNELL 0The Crimson entered Sunday afternoon hoping to continue the strong team performance it displayed against the Lions. After Cornell’s close loss to Trinity last weekend, Harvard knew its opponents were capable of notching an upset.
“We love the challenge,” Kingshott said. “We’d rather be tested than play matches which are less competitive, so it makes us stronger if we know people are gunning for us and want to take us down. We’ll rise to that occasion.”Kingshott got her team off to a fast start, with a victory in straight sets at the No. 6 position that extended the senior’s unbeaten season. Elsewhere in the round, No. 9 freshman Isabelle Dowling recovered after dropping the first game by taking over the rest of the match, winning the fourth and final game, 11-2.Sophomore Haley Mendez took the first two games of her match at No. 3, but a series of contentious let calls and mishit shots gave Big Red senior Jaime Laird a lifeline in the third game. But Mendez was able to flush the distractions and take the final game, 11-4.With the 3-0 lead, the Crimson’s comfort in the match grew, and Harvard took all three of the second round matches in straight games. Freshman Saumya Karki continued her strong rookie season, picking up her seventh collegiate win, while sophomore Julianne Chu won three close games to close out her match. Senior Laura Gemmell, despite being visibly in pain from a leg injury and stretching at every break, fended off junior Jesse Pacheco, 11-7, 13-11, 11-8.With the match already in hand, the third round of matches went quickly. Co-captain Sarah Mumanachit only played one game, winning 11-3, before her Cornell senior Maggie Remsen retired due to injury. Freshman Michelle Gemmell matched her sister’s result, registering a 3-0 win for her sixth victory of the season. At the No. 1 position, sophomore and defending individual national champion Amanda Sobhy had to recover from early deficits in each of her first two games to take a 2-0 lead. In the third game, Sobhy was down 10-7 and in a position to lose the first game of her collegiate career. She survived three game balls to take the game and a match, 12-10.“[The result] is a good confidence boost for us going to [No. 4] Trinity,” Kingshott said. “They are another step above. Every match now is building on each other.”HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0Harvard easily dispatched of Columbia, 9-0, Saturday afternoon, as no Crimson player dropped a game in the first Ivy League match since the Jan. 13 loss to the Tigers.At the No. 1 spot, Laura Gemmell deposed of Lions’ No. 1 Catherine Jenkins by only allowing four total points against. Her dominance typified the Crimson performance, as no Columbia player scored more than eight points in any game.Sobhy and Mumanchit sat out for the Columbia match, meaning sophomore Megan Murray and senior Eliza Calihan entered the top nine and took 3-0 victories at the No. 8 and No. 9 spots, respectively.“It’s always good having more teams to play varsity,” Laura Gemmell said, referring to the Lions’ recent transition to a varsity program. “Since they are a bit weaker, I think people use it as a warm-up to work on things in their game and try different game styles.”—Staff writer Peter G.

The Harvard women’s water polo team swept its opening matches Saturday, defeating three visitors at Blodgett Pool. The Crimson defeated Iona, 15-13, and Villanova, 18-6, before closing out the day with a 10-7 win over CAMO.Nine different Harvard players scored over the course of the day. Freshmen Yoshi Andersen and Charlotte Hendrix each had multiple hat tricks in their collegiate debuts.“I was very excited with the way we’ve started off,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I think we did a lot of good things. Defensively, we really moved today; we locked it down when we needed to.”HARVARD 12, CAMO 8The Crimson took a commanding early lead and held on for its third win in eight hours as Harvard defeated CAMO, a Montreal-based junior national team, 12-8. Andersen and co-captain Aisha Price both recorded hat tricks.

The Crimson jumped out to a 6-0 lead less than three minutes into the second quarter as Andersen and co-captain Elise Molnar found the net multiple times. Junior Shayna Price and freshman Rachel Lobato also contributed to the early run.But a scrappy CAMO team challenged Harvard in spurts. The club closed out the second quarter with a 4-1 run.“[CAMO is] an international team, and it’s a different style,” Minnis said. “They’re a very physical team, and that’s not something you see all the time. They make you work for everything.”The Crimson controlled the opening of the third period as Andersen completed the hat trick and Aisha Price contributed two close-range floaters to put Harvard up, 10-4. But CAMO responded with another strong back-half, ending the quarter on a 3-0 run to cut the Crimson’s lead to three.Harvard’s final goal with just over a minute left in the final frame put the game out of reach. Aisha Price zipped a close shot from the right wing for her fourth goal of the evening.“I thought it was pretty inspiring that we were able to pull it together for three games,” Andersen said. “It just shows how dedicated everybody was to preseason.”HARVARD 18, VILLANOVA 6Harvard surged to an 11-0 lead in its best start of the day as the Crimson cruised to beat the Wildcats, 18-6. Aisha Price led all scorers with five strikes while Hendrix and sophomore Kalina Grabb were close behind with four and three goals, respectively.Andersen struck first for the Crimson just over two minutes into the first quarter. Harvard added another five markers in the opening frame, including two from Grabb.The Crimson tallied five more unanswered goals in the second period before Villanova found its first. In the third, Villanova outscored Harvard, 2-1, but the Crimson controlled the last quarter, 6-3, to ride to a 12-goal win. Minnis felt that Harvard’s next meeting with Villanova in two weeks will not be as comfortable.

UPDATED: February 5, 2013, at 1:36 a.m.Emmy Award-winning actor Kiefer Sutherland has been named the recipient of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2013 Man of the Year Award.Sutherland has won numerous awards for his portrayal of Jack Bauer in the Fox television series “24,” including the Golden Globe for Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2002 and the Emmy Award in 2006 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.“Kiefer is a gifted performer, who has made meaningful contributions to television, film, and theater,” said Hasty Pudding Theatricals’s press and publicity manager Tyler B. Faux ’13.The president of the the Hasty Pudding Theatricals could not be reached for comment.
Sutherland, born in London, was raised in Canada.

In a world that has witnessed the rise of digital interfaces, online avatars, and one-click transactions, a basically conservative reaction has become fashionable in circles both left and right: A creeping depersonalization is killing everything we hold dear. As a fundamental optimist about the future, it’s my tendency not to put much stock in such arguments. Albeit some changes in platform, the social content of our lives would still be eminently familiar to our great-grandparents: We build friendships, go to work, pair off, and make homes. Same as it ever was.This said, a few days ago, my faith in online platforms as seamless extensions of humanity was faced with a crisis of tangled wires and mislabeled files. Recoil if you must, but like many of my peers, I’m in the midst of the career recruiting season and engaged in the online dating world. Both pursuits of a better life require abstraction into profiles, reduction to essential tidbits, and careful curation of flattering perspectives.The overlap is surprisingly non-trivial. Both company applications and OKCupid ask you to put your qualifications in terms of drop-down categories; CVs and selfies (whose form, we’re told, says as much as their content) need to be uploaded, lest no one care how eager you are to get onboard. Contra tech messianism, we’re still miles away from pure representation in the digital space.And when the back-to-school maelstrom of internship deadlines and evenings yet to be planned takes to portals and profiles, accidents happen and the seams come into stark relief. I wish I had a story to tell about an unlucky Wellesley woman who opened her inbox only to find a cover letter addressed to some dynamic, problem-solving would-be lover named Oliver Wyman. Mine is in fact worse.I turned on my phone to an anxious message: so-and-so from the On-Campus Interview program, saying that there had been a problem with my transcript, to call back immediately. Remembering that in a spell of digital haste, I had uploaded an image file of my transcript rather than the prescribed scan, I called back without trepidation, acknowledging at first breath that I knew what the problem was, and was ready to fix it.
“So it was an accident?” the career services guru led me.“No. I was in a hurry, and the image file was all I had,” I answered, worried that I’d crossed some inviolable law of transcript-sharing.“Are you sure? Because it was a picture of a girl…on a runway.”Unwilling to explain to a stranger that I’d pulled a photo of an online date prospect to show to my roommates, I feigned confusion and promised to get to a computer immediately. Though my company-portal applications appeared unharmed, she explained that I had saved the very unsuitable image as “Current Transcript” on my Harvard careers page. Damage control was underway, but two firms had already downloaded the shapely runway girl, whose knowing pout gave no evidence of my coursework in Arabic or my above-average GPA.I do not mean to blame the mishap entirely on an overwired world: I elected to enroll with both OCI and OKC, I should have double-checked my document uploads, and I probably could have gone without downloading the glamour shot of a woman I’ve never met. In any case, it is hard to imagine such indiscretion in a world before profiles: No one in his right mind would attach an 8 by 11½ of a prospective mate to a physical resume, blurt out his scores and qualifications on a first date, or anything of a similarly catastrophic sort. We would—speaking generously—call such a type antisocial.Moral considerations set completely aside, situations like these are to be expected when communication is unmoored from its human producers and abstracted by machines much better suited to huge numbers than to simple decency. The OCI portal has no good way of tailoring searches to personality; high scores on OKC’s numerical matching system prove to be of no avail in the absence of good biochemistry. Limited though our scope may be, evolution’s brain-and-behavior legacy rarely fails us in distinguishing right from not-quite in determining what to share with would-be employers versus would-be mates.The solution, however, is not to abandon our tools. Career portals and dating sites flourish precisely because they work—not by replacing human intuition and pattern recognition, but by broadening our horizons and suggesting opportunities that might have been lost in the welter of our modern minds. We must push the limits of our nature anew: Just as the first Sumerian reed scribes learned to proofread, digital multitaskers will have to become organized to a fault and adept at sensing when something is “off” about their digital interactions.And if the story of my very comely transcript is any indicator, failure to evolve will not be without consequence.Joshua B. Lipson ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is a Near Eastern languages and civilizations concentrator in Winthrop House. His column appears on alternate Mondays.

Though professors may spend their weeks lecturing, meeting with students, and mentoring advisees, much of their work outside of the classroom remains a mystery to most students.This is the issue Svetlana I. Dotsenko ’11 was seeking to solve when she created the online platfrom Project Lever soon after graduating from the College. The startup, which aims to facilitate student searches for thesis advisers and research opportunities, joins the growing movement to digitize Harvard’s archives and resources.Although Dotsenko, who concentrated in government, said that while she had a “great” advising experience, she wanted to improve the unwieldy task of identifying a faculty adviser for students in large departments.“We needed some kind of tool to connect undergraduates to thesis advisers,” Dotsenko said. “It’s about helping those relationships within the University.”Dotsenko began working with Karen Kaletka, coordinator of undergraduate studies in government, after gaining support from the government department to compile a list of theses, advisers, and courses that would guide juniors through the writing process.
Ian H. Clark ’12, Project Lever’s partnerships director, said it has been a challenge to search for past thesis topics and advisors because many of Harvard’s records are physical manuscripts rather than digital archives.“Writing a thesis is not an easy task,” Clark said. “You need an easy-to-use system to manage the start of your thesis.”MIT became Project Lever’s first client outside of the University this January. Clark and the Project Lever team are currently reaching out to other research institutitons to expand the scope of their services. They have also been working with current undergraduate students, such as Jackson F. Cashion ’13, to determine how best to meet students’ needs in the research process.“There are a lot things that students have to balance throughout the thesis writing process—finding grants, an adviser, and library resources to connect them with primary sources. Project Lever streamlines that process into one unified tool,” Cashion said.The founders hope to grow Project Lever into a tool to facilitate a wide range of research.“Eventually we hope Project Lever can be used for research in general, not just for connecting students to thesis advisers,” Clark said.Given increasing access to academic records online, Dotsenko said that perhaps Project Lever may also be used to discourage plagiarism.“We hope to make an open platform where people can see everything else before them and be inspired to create something great,” she said.—Staff writer Jessica Barzilay can be reached at jessicabarzilay@college.harvard.edu.

This is the first installment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues. If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic ""Should women serve in combat roles in the military?"", please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday 6th February at 6pm. Before It’s Too LateIt is unfortunate that the question of whether to negotiate with designated terrorists often comes up at moments of crisis, when governments are at their lowest point of leverage. This is to say, governments are much worse-poised to negotiate with elements they consider to be terrorists when the threat of violence is immediate than during times of relative calm, when state power and intelligence far outstrips the means of small terror cells and networks.Although the wanton slaughters at the Tigantourine gas facility, Dubrovka Theater, and Lod Airport should not be minimized, it was clear in utilitarian terms to the Algerian, Russian, and Israeli governments during these moments of crisis that capitulating to terrorist demands would have been harmful to state interests and encouraged would-be terrorists lying in the woodwork. In 2011, contrary to this principle, Binyamin Netanyahu approved the release of 1,027 prisoners (responsible for the deaths of 569 Israeli civilians) to meet the demands of Hamas in order to secure the release of the kidnapped Corporal Gilad Shalit. As a consequence of the terrorists’ remarkable achievement, Palestinian moderates with less of a flair for drama and violent threats have come to seem impotent, given their inability to extract concessions without resorting to terror. Remarkably, the Israeli government continues to profess that it refuses to negotiate with terrorists—a line that only seems to hold when nothing is acutely wrong. This approach is the complete inverse of what reason would dictate. Operating on the assumption that terrorists are interest-driven creatures, governments ought to keep lines of communication open with anti-state extremists during quiet times—when the state can shape the terms of engagement—and respond to outbursts and standoffs with targeted force. This would deliver the message that acts of violence against civilians do not pay.

Dramatic Act, Quiet CodaAs a rule, governments should not negotiate with terrorists. That is the consensus of the global community because it is understood that declaring this policy may deter acts of terror. The logic is simple: If aspiring terrorists expect that their demands will not be considered, they will not waste their resources taking hostages. But proving its efficacy requires knowing a counterfactual.  Non-negotiation with terrorists is the most reasonable declarative stance on an issue in which no stance can be definitely validated. Nothing about the events in Algeria should call this into question.Nevertheless, the events in Algeria raise troubling questions on which, unlike negotiation with terrorists, there is no settled, reasoned consensus.Consider, for example, that the situation in Mali escalated because the Tuareg revolt was coopted by an AQIM splinter group, Ansar Dine. An ethnic independence movement became an ideological terrorist campaign. That is what happened here, but it just as often appears elsewhere as a false narrative employed by repressive regimes to justify their refusal to grant rights and autonomy to minority groups.  Examine how China brands the Uighurs—a Muslim community seeking greater autonomy—as it rejects their aspirations: It identifies them with Islamic terrorism. When nations do not want to negotiate with minorities, they simply claim that they are refusing to negotiate with terrorists.Above all, though, I suspect that the legacy of this crisis will be that it spurred the US to cement and expand its drone program, furthering its disturbing unilateral redefinition of norms about when, where, and why people can be killed. Ironically, the terrorists responsible for the Algeria crisis should not expect that they have won a voice through their vocal acts. Instead, they should expect to hear a haunting whir far overhead, and then, if only for a moment, a terrible crash: a sentence, issued from a bench unseen and unexplained, to the eternal silence of death.Michael Mitchell ’14 is a social studies concentrator in Pforzheimer House. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Harvard International Review. One Size Does Not Fit AllIn his address to the Global Economic Forum in Davos last week, Algerian Foreign Minister, Mourad Medelci, admitted Algeria “made mistakes” in handling the hostage crisis at the BP gas plant but defended his government’s decision to launch a military operation rather than negotiate with the terrorists. The statement was issued no doubt in response to the criticism from the international community of Algeria’s decision to use military force rather than negotiation, which compromised the lives of dozens of foreign nationals.

UPDATED: February 4, 2013, at 4:37 a.m.The Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility conducted two meetings with student groups on Friday to discuss socially responsible investing.One meeting focused on the details of a social choice fund, whose creation was <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">announced in December.The second centered on student demands for the University to divest from fossil fuel companies. Last week, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email that, while Harvard leaders are listening to student concerns, “the University operates with a strong presumption against divestment.”The CCSR consists of four members from the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and helps to determine the University’s stance on matters related to social responsibility.
Three members of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition met with CCSR members Robert D. Reischauer ’63 and Laurence S. Bacow to push for more details about Harvard’s social choice fund, which is scheduled to be established July 1. An officer from the Harvard Management Company and an administrator from the Office of Alumni Affairs and Development were also in attendance.Sam F. Wohns ’14, who attended the social choice fund meeting as the Coalition’s alumni coordinator, said he was pleased that the meeting, which went over its allotted 45 minutes, was a “very productive” conversation. According to Wohns, the CCSR members said that the Corporation will disclose which mutual funds will be used for the social choice fund. The CCSR will also seek input from groups, such as the Coalition and the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which includes four students, four faculty members, and four alumni who advises the CCSR.“We were very happy with the agreements that we reached on those two issues,” Wohns said.Still, Wohns said that he and other student activists are concerned about the sustainability of the fund and hopes that Harvard will avoid pitfalls that have doomed similar funds at other schools.“We’ve learned from other schools that unless the University plays an active role...the social choice fund tends to disappear over time,” he said. “We are determined for that not to happen here.”Wohns cited the University’s announcement that 20 percent of the fund’s initial value will be paid out annually for student financial aid as a danger to the fund’s potential for growth. According to Wohns, the Coalition has suggested supporting the fund with money from the University’s endowment and stressed that robust advertisement of the fund to donors will be crucial for its success.“We’ll need to hear a stronger commitment to the fund launch and particularly the fund’s advertisement to alumni donors,” Wohns said. The Coalition is still deciding whether or not to transfer the Fair Harvard Fund—approximately $11,000 that the group has collected to show support for socially responsible investing—to the social choice fund.Regardless of the fund’s details, Wohns said it is still merely a “first step,” and that he and other socially responsible investment supporters want to see Harvard’s entire $30 billion endowment invested responsibly.“We see the social fund as a way for the University to experiment with investment policies that it can ultimately apply to the rest of Harvard’s endowment,” he said.According to Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14, who attended both CCSR meetings with UC Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14, the members of the Corporation will meet on Monday to discuss the process of selecting mutual funds to use for the social choice fund.

There has been a deviation in Harvard’s most popular course.This spring, 642 students have enrolled in Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” making it Harvard’s biggest course for the first time in recent memory, according to course enrollment data on the website of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office.Stat 104 narrowly beat Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” a perennial contender for the title of top-enrolled course of the semester. Ec 10, economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s introductory economics course, drew an enrollment of 627.This is the first time that Stat 104 has trumped Ec 10, which was formerly titled Social Analysis 10, since the first semester of course enrollment data available online dating back to the fall of 1999. That fall, 817 students took Ec 10, while only 34 took Stat 104.Statistics lecturer Michael I. Parzen, instructor of Stat 104, attributed the course’s growth to quality teaching and a popular subject matter.
“I think the enrollments reflect the hard work of our teaching staff, our attempt to make the course as organized as possible, and the increasing visibility of statistics in the private sector,” Parzen wrote in an email. He added that the course’s teaching staff is considering greater use of technology in class to handle the increased enrollment numbers.Pre-Term Planning predictions significantly underestimated the turnout for Stat 104. An additional 238 students signed up for the course than projected by Pre-Term Planning. The course enrollment planning tool was relatively accurate for Ec 10, overestimating actual enrollment by just 18 students.Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the US: Medicine and Disease in Social Context” also saw a significant increase in enrollment this spring. The 408 students who signed up for the course surpass both the Pre-Term Planning prediction of 172 and last spring’s enrollment of 265.In an email, the course’s instructor, sociology professor Nicholas A. Christakis, noted that Sociology 190 has experienced a trend of growing enrollment since he first began teaching it seven years ago.But he attributed this year’s dramatic jump in enrollment to the fact that this is the last year he is offering the course at Harvard. Christakis, who is also the Co-House Master of Pforzheimer, will<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/19/christakis-house-masters-yale/""> leave Harvard for Yale this summer.To accommodate the increased number of students, Christakis wrote that he is looking for a new location for the class, which last week was held in Science Center C.Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” and Engineering Sciences 50: “Introduction to Electrical Engineering” also registered unusually high enrollment. Engineering Sciences 50 went from 71 students last spring to 173 this semester, a 144 percent increase, while Computer Science 51 jumped from an enrollment of 192 last spring to 240 this semester.—John P.

To the editor:I write in response to the letter of complaint from Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 about the University’s handling of the recent cheating scandal.Stemberg’s letter begins with the blunt statement that many of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors are “not qualified to teach undergraduates.” Though I lack specific knowledge of the workings of Harvard appointments, I am not convinced by a statement that fails to articulate in what respect these professors are unqualified.Stemberg then calls the phrasing of the collaboration policy into question: “One was told that on this particular take home exam, one could not collaborate with professors, teaching fellows ‘and others.’ One would suppose this meant students. If the message was so clearly expressed, why did some of the teaching fellows go over the exam in open session, a per se violation of the professor’s seeming intent? If they did not get the message, could one expect the students to understand it?”The exact phrasing of the policy read: “students may not discuss the exam with others – this includes resident tutors, writing centers, etc.” Yes, “others” includes students as well. The suggestion that what a teaching fellow cannot understand must be difficult for students to understand is offensive to those of us enjoying the benefits of literacy.
It is unfortunate that a teaching fellow would violate the policy, yet it does not license further academically dishonest behavior.As the letter progresses, Stemberg distinguishes between students who were “literally cutting and pasting their answers” and students who were punished for using notes “derived in the collaborative atmosphere the class encouraged.” Whereas Stemberg seems only to find it appropriate to punish the former group, the appropriateness of punishing the second group depends on when the collaborative atmosphere existed, that is, whether it existed during the take-home exam.The letter ends with the outrageous claim that, in Stemberg’s words, the administration “let off only those students who lied and said others had copied from them.” The claim is understandable given that the letter is grounded in a few personal accounts. From knowing students involved in the cheating scandal, I would want to assert that there were students found innocent without lying. Yet I cannot credibly assert that relying only on my partial understanding of the situation. Similarly, Stemberg’s letter loses credibility for its lack of proper access to crucial information, making his blanket statements about right and wrong forms of cheating all the more inappropriate.While only admitting the wrongfulness of academic dishonesty in passing, Stemberg calls the FAS faculty’s competence into question without grounding and makes an effort to undermine the clarity of the collaboration policy. It is an unfair move to attempt to shift the responsibility away from those who were found, through what Stemberg himself calls “a seemingly endless judicial process,” to have engaged in academically dishonest behavior, to University staff who were offered no such arbitration.Oliver C. Wenner ’14Cambridge, Mass.

Following his second inaugural address, The Crimson Staff <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/25/harvard-inauguration/"">criticized President Barack Obama for defending entitlement programs “wholesale” and advocating for deficit reduction only in passing. In the conventional wisdom, to which the piece dutifully adhered, the federal government has a borrowing problem that poses a major threat to the economy now and in the future, and immediate and significant cuts to entitlement programs represent the only real solution.On its face, the conventional wisdom is correct. America does have a debt problem, it is dragging on our economy, and entitlements could use reform. But the true fiscal crisis America faces right now is not fundamentally an economic one—it’s political. For this crisis, Obama’s speech was dead on.The prevailing economic argument against current debt levels says that, despite record-low interest rates on Treasury bonds today, the United States’ creditors will eventually demand higher interest rates out of fear that the government will be unable to meet its obligations. While no one can pinpoint the exact debt level at which this crisis will occur, America’s debt over the past four years theoretically presents a huge risk.Yet, despite years of dire warnings, no such crisis is upon us. Short-term Treasury rates remain near <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TB3MS?cid=116"">all-time lows, negative when adjusted for inflation—investors are effectively paying the U.S. government to hold their money. Indeed, market signals today suggest the American government should be borrowing more, not less, while it is so cheap to do so.Further, in spite of these signals, Obama and the Congress have already reduced the deficit by about <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/10/how-much-more-deficit-reduction-do-we-need-cbpp-says-1-4-trillion/"">$2.4 trillion in a series of deals. Another $1.4 trillion, analysts say, and the deficit and debt will both remain at reasonable levels for the next 10 years.
And yet, says the conventional wisdom, we have a debt crisis.Deficit hawks insist that stabilizing the debt over the next 10 years is not enough, pointing to unsustainable debt-to-GDP ratios in the 2040s or ’50s. Lacking the economic impetus for action on a problem years down the road, however, they have turned to political tactics. Economists and politicians on both sides have elevated the debt to a national emergency through doomsday debt crisis scenarios—rather than an honest debate about the virtues of deficit reduction—knowing that nothing gets done in Washington without a crisis.Aided by Washington gridlock, this political maneuver has succeeded. Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on how to reduce the deficit, so every fiscal battle comes with the possibility of default, downgrade, and/or recession. Such high levels of uncertainty, combined with the austerity that eventually emerges, have hindered the recovery and called into question our political system’s ability to, quite literally, pay the bills. Many have mistaken these as consequences of our debt itself, rather than the way we have chosen to approach it. This mistake only fuels the crisis narrative.Yes, our recent fiscal conundrums have had some benefit. It should take only one or two more fiscal-cliff-type dramas this spring to bring the debt on a sustainable path for the coming decade. Addressing the debt beyond that, however, requires major reforms to programs, like Medicare, contingent upon future health care costs that are unpredictable today—and may already be <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-08-23/medicare-spending-slows-as-hospitals-improve-care-peter-orszag.html#p1"">falling thanks to the Affordable Care Act. All told, the high costs these manufactured crises have wrought on our economy and political system seem to far outweigh the potential benefits of further budget cuts.Yet the debt crisis narrative—a political choice disguised as economic reality—has gained so much credence that it is unlikely to fade.Unless politicians begin to change the conversation.Unless, that is, lawmakers finally start emphasizing our pressing national issues—like climate change, immigration, gun violence, and most of all, unemployment—rather than persisting in their failed attempts at “grand bargains” designed to brace for potentialities many years down the road while distracting from other priorities.President Obama’s second inaugural aimed to do just that. Calling upon Americans to “act in our time,” the president signaled an end to debt crisis politics. The speech displayed a new Obama pragmatism that aims to improve America’s future prospects by addressing current realities.This may seem like a plea for shortsightedness, and in a strict sense it is. But politics is the art of the possible. Is it possible that we could set the debt on a steady course not only ten but 30, 40 years down the road? Just 15 years ago, the federal government was <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/18xx/doc1820/eb0100.pdf"">projected to pay off its entire debt by the year 2009. Unfortunately, things like 9/11, two wars, and a massive financial crisis got in the way.So let’s continue to reduce the debt to manageable levels. Let’s reform entitlements to improve efficiency and secure them for the future. Let’s make our tax code fairer and more pro-growth. And let’s implement and improve Obamacare to start bending the health care cost curve and reducing long-term debt <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/29/entitlements-spending/"">responsibly. But let’s say goodbye to the debt crisis narrative that has outlived its usefulness and now works to the detriment of concrete economic and social goals. The President has.Daniel E. Backman ’15 is a social studies concentrator in Mather House.

The year 2012 saw fewer crimes in Cambridge, continuing a trend where the overall serious crime rate decreased for each of the last three years and violent crime declined for each of the past four.Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas gave credit for the decrease to not only the police officers in the field, but also the employees who analyze and synthesize data related to crime.“By giving our officers this information, they have done an exceptional job of working to break patterns before they are able to fully materialize,” he said in a press release last week. “It is their hard work and commitment to this community which have made us successful in working to reduce crime.”Several important indicators of crime in Cambridge fell over the past year. Property crime fell by two percent and violent crime was down five percent. Serious crime, an aggregate statistic including property crime and violent crime, fell three percent total. Much of this improvement was due to a remarkably low number of commercial robberies in 2012—last year, only 16 businesses were burglarized, down from 34 in 2011.Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello told The Crimson that while he could not attribute the decline in commercial robberies to a single initiative, the department has been working with local businesses for years to decrease robberies. Rivello pointed to one particular program that sends officers to local businesses to work with owners on an crafting effective security plans as a potential contributor.
“We have officers that go and meet with the business community and address any concerns, share any [relevant] information we might have, and talk to owners about how the business can protect themselves,” he said.Despite last year’s improvements, the frequency of some types of crime remained the same, or even increased in 2012. Twenty-three rapes, including the two that occurred last August on Harvard’s campus, took place in 2012—the same number as in 2011. And even with what CPD in its press release called “successful undercover operations” against pickpockets, larceny from a person in 2012 increased by 15 percent. Larceny from a motor vehicle grew by seven percent last year.Riviello added that despite the improvements reflected in last year’s statistics, CPD attempts to look beyond the numbers.“We’re very excited about the fall in crime,” he said. “It’s the fourth year in a row. But we’re not just focusing on the numbers, because every time there is a crime, there are still people being victimized.”—Staff writer Matthew Q. Clarida can be reached clarida@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: February 5, 2013, at 4:54 a.m.As Harvard sought to bookend its massive cheating investigation with an announcement last Friday, students implicated in the scandal said the new information raised more questions than it answered.On Friday morning, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith sent an email to the Harvard community to offer what he called “a few final, general words” on the academic integrity investigation that has rocked Harvard’s campus for the past five months.Smith’s email concerned the Administrative Board’s investigation of about 125 students in last spring’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” who were accused of cheating on the class’s take-home final. He was writing, he said, “to shine a bright light on the important issue of academic integrity and what we are doing on this issue.”In his announcement, Smith reported that more than half of the implicated students—a figure that translates to approximately 70 undergraduates—were forced to temporarily withdraw from the College following the Ad Board’s investigation. Smith wrote that of the remaining investigated students, half received probation, while the other half received no punishment.
Even so the email did not name the class and provided no precise numbers about how many students were disciplined.One investigated student, whose case resulted in probation, said he was disappointed by the contents of Smith’s message.“I think that it was a bunch of fluff, had absolutely no significant content, and trivialized how unfairly every student involved was treated,” said the student, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he was worried about retaliation from administrators.Smith provided the details about the distribution of punishments nearly 800 words into his email, following a lengthy explanation of the general purpose and procedures of the Ad Board. Some students said they did not immediately realize Smith’s email concerned the cheating scandal.“I didn’t even read all the way through the email because I thought it was just another administrative announcement,” said Emily J. Reese ’14, who took Government 1310 last spring and was not investigated by the Ad Board. “I deleted it right away.”Several accused students said the email also failed to address lingering questions about the scandal, the way it was handled, and what criteria were used to reach their decisions.The father of a varsity athlete implicated in the scandal said he was frustrated that the email did not acknowledge the mistakes that he believes Harvard made over the course of the investigation.“I find the whole letter insulting and offensive,” said the man, whose son lost NCAA eligibility after he was forced to withdraw late in the fall term. “There’s been no acknowledgment of [Harvard’s] responsibility.”In his email, Smith wrote that due to the “unprecedented number and complexity of cases,” some students did not receive their verdicts until December, more than three months after the investigation was announced.Delays in the investigation also caused concern among implicated students about tuition payments. According to the student handbook, students who withdrew from the College for any reason this past fall were required to pay tuition in increasing increments up to $18,788 after the Sept. 11 study card day. But to “create greater financial equity” for students who received their decisions later than others, Smith announced in his email Friday that anyone who was asked to withdraw after Sept. 30 would be issued refunds for all tuition paid past that date.

Pointing out that the days of playing pick-up baseball after school are long gone, officials from the Cambridge City Council and the Cambridge Schools Committee discussed ways to enrich Cantabrigian students’ extracurricular lives at the Council’s weekly meeting Monday night.At the round table meeting, officials stressed the need to expand student participation in so-called “out-of-school-time programs”—extracurricular activities occurring afterschool and over breaks.“There should be no kid that goes home and plays Nintendo,” said Councillor Leland Cheung. “There’s no need to go home before five, six o’ clock.”Many officials said they were concerned that the cost of extracurricular activities was discouraging students from participating and suggested creating scholarships for programs with hefty pricetags.“Sometimes, children see the price column and shut down,” said Susan Richards, coordinator of out-of-school-time activities for the city of Cambridge. “Let’s take away the price column.”
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 asked officials to concentrate not only on increasing the number of afterschool programs in Cambridge but also on improving the quality of those programs that already exist. He noted the absence of extracurricular activities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.“We need to focus on things that will give us outcomes,” said Reeves. “I just don’t think that cheerleading and football are what we’re looking for in terms of outcome.”On Monday a task force of school administrators and educators called the Out-of-School-Time Design Team presented their proposals for increasing extra-curricular participation. One program that the task force will pilot this year involves creating online “out-of-school-time passports” for middle-schoolers. Teachers and coaches from participating extracurricular programs would modify these passports, awarding their students “stamps” for significant participation and “badges” for improvement.“We want the OST passport to grow within the upper school culture,” said Richards. “We hope that it will be something the students will want show-off.”In an effort to raise awareness about opportunities that already exist, the Design Team recently compiled a booklet of out-of-school-time programs.“Education happens beyond the framework of the school day,” said Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young at the start of the meeting. “We are really committed to providing those enriching opportunities to students.”—Staff writer Sonali Y. Salgado can be reached at ssalgado@college.harvard.edu.

Professors and administrators will discuss the Government 1310 cheating scandal at their monthly Faculty Meeting Tuesday, according to faculty members who have received the meeting agenda. The discussion is the first among faculty since Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced the results of the investigation in a University-wide email Friday.The University announced in August that it was investigating approximately 125 students thought to be involved in widespread cheating on a take-home exam last spring in the course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”Professors said Smith’s email on Friday was the first they had heard of the case from the administration since the initial announcement. Discussion amongst faculty members since then, they said, has been largely limited to personal conversations.The University made the investigation public in the hopes that it could be used as a “teaching opportunity” that fostered broader discussion on academic honesty. Faculty members are hopeful that Tuesday’s meeting will give them a chance to reflect on the University’s handling of the case.Government professor Michael E. Rosen said that he has no reason to question the way in which Harvard handled the controversy. He said he thinks that trust amongst the students and faculty is essential as Harvard looks to prevent such incidents in the future.
“Harvard—universities in general—are learning institutions, and we all make mistakes,” Rosen said. “And while cheating is a very grave mistake, it’s very important that...the University handles it in a way that people can learn from it.”In his email to faculty and students, Smith indicated that the Committee on Academic Integrity hopes to release a number of proposals in the coming months regarding the scholarly values of both students and professors.—Staff writer Nicholas P.

Despite having advised the film “Black Swan” and released singles in Europe and Japan as a singer and lyricist, Francesca Harper is best known for her uniquely expressive dance performances and original choreography. Harper trained at the School of American Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet School, and The Ailey School and acclaimed dance teacher Madame Gabriela Darvash and dancer Barbara Walczak. Harper was the principal dancer in William Forsythe’s Ballet Frankfurt from 1994-1999, and performed in Broadway productions including “Fosse” and “The Producers.” On Thursday, Harper will give a master class for student dancers at the Harvard Dance Center. She will bring her experience not only as a dancer, but also as the founder of a non profit. In 2005, she created The Francesca Harper Project, which fuses classical dance forms with text, music, and film to explore themes of politics, race, sexuality, love, and humanity.The Harvard Crimson: What drew you and inspired you to dance?Francesca Harper: I always knew that I wanted to pursue a career in dance. My mother, Denise Jefferson, was a dance teacher. She was modern dancer and ended [up] being the director for The Ailey School for 26 years.  She had been gifted in ballet, but because of the race issues in the ‘60s, she felt discouraged. She found ballet again after college. I heard her story, [and it] encouraged me.THC: How did you transition from being a dancer to choreographing your own works?FH: William Forsythe worked very collaboratively with [me]. He would sometimes ask us to create material, which he would use in his own works. That made me think that I could choreograph my own works, and I went on to start my own company in 2005.THC: Your works often incorporate film into the choreography. How does video function in your artistry? FH: I always have enjoyed [video]. I really loved the aesthetic it brings. It speaks as an unconscious layer to the movement on stage. And I showcased at the Video Dance Awards in 1998 in Frankfurt. That experience became integrated into my creative thesis.THC: You’re also a singer and are known for your 2003 single, “Would I?” How did you come to explore singing and lyricism?FH: Forsythe knew that I had a voice, so he had me sing at a performance, and there was a music producer that was there in the audience. [He] asked if I could release a track. It went worldwide from Germany. Then I came back to New York to work on my voice. I did Broadway for six years…including “The Color Purple.” I received principal roles as well. Now I’m currently working on my first opera, working with director Robert Wilson.THC: What do you look forward to most in your upcoming collaboration with the Harvard Dance Program?FH: [Director of the Office for the Arts at Dance Program]  Jill Johnson and I are old colleagues and old friends. I’m looking forward to seeing the foundation she has built in the past few years. Knowing the brilliance and intellectual rigor at Harvard, I am looking forward to the exchange with students’ insight and knowledge. This will be very exciting for me.
THC: And how will you engage with students in the master class? Are there certain techniques student dancers can look forward to practicing?FH: [After] doing a warm-up, I’ll introduce some of Forsythe’s technique. He really set dance improvisation systems. Then I will also have dancers improvise and create their own dance constructions.THC: What words do have for anyone who is interested in dance or artistic exploration?FH: [From] Martha Graham: your artistic voice needs to be honored. She says, “There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique.” It is your duty as an artist to honor that. To anyone who wants practice their artistry, it is their duty to honor that voice and need.—Staff writer Nzuekoh N. Nchinda can be reached at nzuekohnchinda14@college.harvard.edu.

Imposing  a viselike grip on Los Angeles, thug Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn),  pontificates to his henchmen: “All things must be burned to the  ground—for the insurance money.” So begins the 1940’s stereotyping and  violence of the stylish “Gangster Squad.”  The  movie quickly becomes an appealing film noir drama and violent  shoot-‘em-up, but throughout it all, “Gangster Squad” is formulaic.  Viewers can take bets on which characters would ultimately end up in  jail or be sacrificed to the movie formula gods. Nevertheless, the ride  was worth it at times. Despite a delayed release date and significant  reshooting of a key scene, director Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland” and  “30 Minutes or Less”) incorporated the alterations seamlessly. The  setting is 1949 Los Angeles—almost every man is home from WWII and  wearing period suits and fedoras. Cohen, having left the “Chicago  outfit” mob for L.A., has his West Coast crime syndicate operating drug  trade, prostitution, and the sole transcontinental wire for all gambling  transactions in the city. Police Chief William Parker (Nick Nolte)  pleads with rebellious Sergeant John O’Mara (Josh Brolin) to lead an  “off the books” team of stereotypical fringe police officers to take  down Cohen’s illicit empire.
With  the exception of Sergeant O’Mara, this team feels expendable. The squad  members become stock characters, such as an electronics expert, an old  timer with experience, and an eager young gun, and they utilize their  special skills in scene after scene. Tension builds predictably  throughout the mayhem, but because key characters such as O’Mara are one  dimensional, the tension never fulfills its potential. O’Mara, however  likeable, never convincingly progresses from a frenzied rebel cop to a  calm, collected character with clear resolve. Despite  the formulaic nature of many of the characters, some of them still  manage to feel compelling. The team also includes archetypal  loose-cannon cool guy Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling). Gosling steals the  show as a Doc Holliday-type figure, bringing pithy comments and cool  demeanor during the intense gunfights, leaving the viewer yearning for  more of his compellingly ambiguous character. Yet Wooters’ romance with  Cohen’s girl, Gracie (Emma Stone) is sexually charged but lacks a  convincing emotional connection, and as a result, she serves as little  more than eye candy. Like  other gangster movies inspired by a true story, the memorability of the  movie is dependent on the realistic villainy of the bad guy.  Unfortunately, Penn’s portrayal of real-life 1940s gangster Cohen fails  to carry the movie—his malice is too rehearsed and cartoonish. His  speeches about “manifest destiny” and “building his city on the ashes of  L.A.” come off as caricaturish. In “Gangster Squad” it is the good guys  who must carry the movie, which goes against the spirit of the classic gangster genre. The  film is well paced, with action that was not too overwhelming and solid  dialogue and one-liners that prevented the film from straying into the  realm of camp. And even with the incredible amount of violence  perpetuated by the crime syndicate, “Gangster Squad” evokes nostalgia  for a bygone era. It stylistically portrays a simpler time when  criminals were only wicked for power and money, which is a breath of  fresh air in a cinematic period where Joker-esque mad men seem all too  prevalent. However, the film’s weak character development makes it  difficult to emotionally invest in the great cast, preventing the film  from realizing its full potential. —Staff writer Alexander J. Spencer can be reached at alexanderspencer@college.harvard.edu.

Memorial Church hosted a screening of “Soundtrack for a Revolution,” a film commemorating the life and message of Martin Luther King, Jr., during the first in a series of events planned to celebrate the University’s third annual Interfaith Awareness Week.The Harvard community adopted Interfaith Awareness Week in 2011, echoing a United Nations initiative that dedicated the first week of February to the task of commemorating and affirming international peace.Those involved in Harvard’s events hope that the week will foster a respectful environment and encourage students to explore the commonalities between all faiths and non-faiths.“This is a very delicate subject, very personal for many of us,” said Harvard Zoroastrian Chaplain Daryush Mehta. “Even if you get just one student who comes to a realization or we’re able to affect a few people, it’s worth it.”In addition to Monday’s screening, the week will also include a talk by former Vice President Al Gore '69 on the health of the planet and its inhabitants, an open meditation sponsored by the Harvard Buddhist Chaplaincy, and a panel entitled “Doubt and Religion.”
S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation, said he thinks that because many students were not on campus to celebrate Martin Luther King Day, which fell during Harvard’s winter break, the film on King’s life was an appropriate way to kick off the week’s events.“Dr. King was a very active Christian who used his Christian philosophy to advance the civil rights movement,” Counter said.The film incorporated soulful music with footage and personal testimonies from Freedom Riders and civil rights activists. Music by contemporary artists was juxtaposed with black-and-white mug shots of various Freedom Riders. Grainy film footage of former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace condemning integration was interspersed with clips of a church choir belting “We Shall Not Be Moved.”“Last year we had a speaker, we had a program. I thought, ‘Let’s try something a little different to get the younger generation more aware,’” said Counter. “John Legend can reach your generation much better than I could.”Following the film, the Kuumba Singers sang “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ’Round,” a song that was prevalent throughout the film.Lea E. Parker ’15, a member of the Kuumba Singers, said she felt a connection to the music in the film.“The way that they used song was particularly meaningful to me,” said Parker. “It was a similar mode of expression that I can relate to.”After the Kuumba Singers’ performance, Aubrey J. Walker ’15 offered the event’s closing remarks, emphasizing the continued need for young people to come together around social movements ranging from mass incarceration to gun control.“We are the voice of a generation and together, we will be heard,” Walker said.Staff writer Anneli Tostar can be reached at annelitostar@college.harvard.edu.

It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.Those words have been a saving grace for Harvard men’s hockey in recent years as the Crimson has suffered through characteristically slow starts before turning up the heat in February to salvage its seasons.On Monday night though, against defending national champion No. 4/5 Boston College (16-7-2, 12-6-1 Hockey East), it was an inability to close otherwise even periods that doomed Harvard (5-15-1, 3-12-0 ECAC) to a 4-1 loss in the first round of the Beanpot at TD Garden.“The last couple minutes of the periods I think our game management took away any opportunity to be in the game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.The overmatched Crimson kept pace with the Eagles for the majority of the first period, but with the clock winding down on the first stanza the puck found BC sophomore Quinn Smith off of a face-off in Harvard’s zone and Smith was one-on-one with junior goaltender Raphael Girard. A feint followed by a shot over Girard’s left shoulder put the Eagles up 1-0 with only 28 seconds left until intermission.
""The first goal was a little bit of a heartbreaker for us,"" Donato said.Up until that point, the first period saw the two teams go back and forth with Girard turning away a number of BC shots as the Crimson offense challenged Eagles net-minder Parker Milner on the other end.  With just under six minutes left in the opening frame, senior Luke Greiner fired a shot toward net that beat Milner, but could not beat the post marking the best scoring opportunity yet for either team.“Greiner maybe caught the goalie sleeping a bit with the post,” Girard said. “[After that] we knew we could maybe get some goals. We knew we could play with this team, that’s for sure.”Then, with 3:13 left in the first, senior defenseman Brendan Rempel was whistled for holding after a crushing hit behind net. The Crimson was able to mount a successful penalty kill, but shortly after the team’s returned to even numbers Smith found the back of the net to open up the scoring.The Crimson came out of the first break composed as a series of Girard saves kept the deficit to one. Girard finished with 42 saves, his second highest total all season.“I thought Raph was outstanding,” Donato said. “When he’s playing like that it gives a lot of confidence up and down the bench.”Two holding calls on Eagles senior Patrick Wey gave Harvard opportunities on the power play, but the BC penalty kill and defense proved formidable on the night, successfully killing three penalties and limiting the Crimson to just 20 shots. With two minutes left on the clock in the second period Girard had recorded 27 saves and Harvard was still down just one.“When we did have our chances I’m not sure we took full advantage of them,” Donato said. “A couple guys had the puck alone in front of net and of course Millner had some good saves. There are not a lot of teams that will win trading chances with that Boston College team. They certainly have a lot of firepower.”That firepower was on full display in the last two minutes of the second period. Smith once again found himself on the receiving end of a fortuitous pass as the puck made its way across net untouched. Smith fired a shot into the upper left corner for his second goal of the game and fourth of the season.51 seconds later BC defenseman Michael Matheson received the puck off the draw and fired a slapshot over Girard’s left shoulder to put the Eagles up, 3-0, and put the game out of reach.A Danny Biega slapshot in the third period saved the Crimson from enduring its fifth shutout of the season, bringing the score to 3-1. The goal was the captain’s first of the year, after posting 10 last season en route to a first team All-America nod.“I just thought about shooting it as hard as I could and I thought it gave us a little more of an edge after the shot,” Biega said.That edge was not sustained as BC’s Steven Whitney would score an unassisted goal late in the third to close out the scoring.Harvard’s inability to advance to next Monday’s Beanpot championship game marked the fifth straight year that the Crimson has been relegated to the consolation game after falling in the first round. Harvard has not won the Beanpot since 1993. Before the Eagles take on Northeastern in the championship in six days’ time, the Crimson will face a rematch with No. 13 Boston University, which Harvard beat, 6-5, in a stunning upset on Jan. 9.—Staff writer Alexander Koenig can be reached at <a href=""mailto:akoenig@college.harvard.edu"">akoenig@college.harvard.edu.

<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Seeing one’s creative work on display in a gallery is typically a privilege reserved for professional artists. But for two weeks, the lobby of the University Place Gallery in Harvard Square gave many amateur photographers a brief moment in the limelight as part of the show “GRAM IT: Instagram Pop Up Show.” This exhibit featured images taken with the popular mobile phone app Instagram, which allows users to quickly snap photos, stylize them with filters, and share them on the web. “GRAM IT,” which closed Wednesday, was organized by the Cambridge Art Association. According to Erin Becker, the executive director of the Association and curator of the show, the motivating question was whether these quickly and casually snapped images can have a lasting effect on public memory. “How could we take Instagram on its own out of the box and put it on the wall?” Becker says. <span style=""white-space: pre;""> The idea for this exhibit came to Becker over the summer, when she saw a photo spread that interested her in the New York Times Magazine. “They had put out a call not to professional photographers, but to New York City residents who used Instagram to take pictures of rooftop summer parties,” she says.   Becker and the team at the Association arranged the photos in a temporary gallery space into five rows of square prints, grouped roughly by theme. Subjects ranged from abstract, stylized forms to naturalistic landscapes and close-up shots of everyday objects. The display was also unique in that it encouraged audience participation. At a reception for the show, viewers were invited to affix heart-shaped stickers below the images they liked, intended to mimic the online phenomenon of “liking” a piece of digital content.  <span style=""white-space: pre;""> To arrange work into an exhibition is to make people take notice of it, and while it may be easy to brush off Instagram as a popular entertainment device, the exhibit suggests that there are reasons to take a closer look at it. As a tool for capturing images, Instagram embodies a bizarre mix of dualities. It is intimate, used to document unique moments of people’s daily lives, and yet homogenizing in the way it makes every user’s images look alike. Though it is cutting-edge consumer technology, it is nostalgic in the way it simulates the look of analog photos. And while the images created by Instagram exist online in perpetuity, they are ephemeral in the way they are captured and quickly forgotten by users after being shared with friends online. While the Association originally considered hiring a jurist to select works for its exhibit, it decided to keep the spirit of the activity truly open to the community and to accept all submissions for the display. Such a system is a radical departure from the selection method more commonly found in professional museums. The majority of individuals who submitted to this show were not professional photographers, although some were artists in other mediums. “We kind of spun it as, ‘Become an instant artist,’” the Association assistant director Cory Shea says. The call for entries went out through flyers and online. “We kept it egalitarian,” Becker says. “You get an interesting slice of the population with Instagram.” The individuals who take photos and share them online are simply people who have a bit of media savvy.<span style=""white-space: pre;"">    Shea, who is a professional photographer herself, says that the difference between the work of amateur and professional photographers, as well as that of other kinds of visual artists, is one of concentrated intention and execution of individual techniques. “The works around us are premeditated.  [The artists] thought consciously of every stroke they made,” she says, gesturing at the paintings hung on the walls of the University Place Gallery.  “With Instagram you capture a moment and it’s more, well, ‘instant,’” Shea says. In the age of accessibility, Instagram has made it possible to take photos that are artistically appealing, but its products have yet to be validated as artistic expressions in their own right, they say. For Shea and Becker, Instagram has the potential to become an accepted art form.—Staff writer Victoria Zhuang can be reached at vzhuang@college.harvard.edu.

In the traditional model of theater, text is a tyrant—actors and directors pay it the utmost attention and devotion, believing it to be the most efficacious way to convey the story. But think of a particularly powerful moment in theater. Is a line from the text itself, or some dramatic action: the smashing of a music box, the destruction of a beautiful family heirloom—or even the “aha” moment, the sudden realization that the story being told through dance is one that you have read several times before? Students in actor Scott Barrow’s Wintersession workshop “Introduction to Moment Work: Exploring Elements of the Stage” identified moments in theater most poignant to them, many of the participants focusing on such visceral instants. As one of the January Arts and Media Seminars organized by the Office for the Arts, Barrow’s workshop offered a limited number of students the opportunity to dissect other facets of theater, such as space, props, and overall aesthetic.  The JAMS programs offered students and non-students the unique opportunity to come in close contact with professional actors, musicians and other artists. Seminars and conversations held throughout the last full week of January were designed to connect students with the arts.
 Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a student in Barrow’s seminar and a Crimson Arts editor, got that chance as he recalled his moment from theater. For him, the actors’ electric performance in a production of Philip Ridley’s “Mercury Fur” culminated in a particularly charged scene. “Unlike ever before, I felt that I shouldn’t be watching this,” McTaggart said. “I felt as a viewer that I was intruding. And for the first time in theater, I felt a real sense of danger.” These moments are made of the type of non-textual elements that Barrow encouraged his students to consider. A member of the Tectonic Theater Project, Barrow believes that the actor is a storyteller who, in order to better tell the theatrical story, should deeply understand its elements beyond the bare text. “The best thing for the students to get out of this would be to be able to develop a vocabulary with the more subtle elements of the stage so we can create an alternative to text-driven theater,”  Barrow says. In order to understand theater, the students first deconstructed it by listing its components: light, shadow, sound, direction, tempo. After delving into these elements, the students created theatrical moments of their own. As the JAMS initiative aims to draw in people of diverse backgrounds, however, the workshop did not attract only actors or even only those involved directly with theater. Nicolas Maffey ’13, who performed in Cirque du Soleil after high school, joined actors, directors, and playwrights in the workshop. “Being a more holistic, a more well-rounded artist is extremely important [in the circus],” Maffey said. “I’m always very interested in learning more about all the tools I have available to come up with a better routine and to become a better artist.” While Barrow’s workshop was limited to students, public conversations were also held around campus as part of the JAMS initiative. In a master class with Christine Ebersole, the public listened as three undergraduates performed and were afterwards advised by the celebrated Broadway star. And audience members learned the tricks of the comedic trade during an afternoon with “Seinfeld” writers Tom Gammill ’79 and Max Pross ’79. In the Kirkland Junior Common Room, Harvard undergraduates had another chance to learn from some other successful artistic alumni: Richard Kogan ’77, Lynn Chang ’75, and Yo-Yo Ma ’76. In a conversation entitled “Forty Years of Music Making: The Divergent Musical Paths of the Kogan Chang Ma Trio,” the three musicians spoke about their experiences since attending Harvard and how they got to where they are today as artists. Kogan, who is both a psychiatrist and a pianist, recalled how his undergraduate experience encouraged his musical talent. “I became really interested in music my freshman year,” he said. “But, probably the more important thing was the friendship I made with [Ma and Chang].”

The Jazz Composers Alliance Orchestra may not set its instruments on fire, but the group will carry the wild and adventurous spirit of Jimi Hendrix to the Berklee Performance Center tonight in a concert entitled “Manic Depression: Music of Jimi Hendrix.” The 19-piece big band is led by Berklee faculty member Darrell Katz, a composer and guitarist and the founder of the Jazz Composers Alliance, parent organization of the Jazz Composers Alliance Orchestra. The group will play a collection of arrangements based on the iconic guitarist’s compositions.The Alliance has celebrated Hendrix’s music several times over the course of its 27-year existence, and these themed concerts have always drawn large crowds and acclaim. The idea arose when Katz saw a string quartet play Hendrix’s “Manic Depression” in concert. “I thought, I could do way better than that,” Katz says. He wrote his own arrangement of “Manic Depression” for a chamber group and eventually decided to develop a whole concert around the concept.Although Hendrix’s hard rock may seem like an odd fit for an avant-garde jazz band, Katz sees many connections between the two distinct styles. “[Hendrix’s] music is more open-ended, blues-oriented,” he says. “It lends itself to extended forms and improvisation.”Katz wrote several arrangements for the concert, and the group will also play jazz pianist Gil Evans’s arrangements of Hendrix tunes. Among the classics being performed are “Stone Free,” “Purple Haze,” and “If 6 Was 9.” Guitarist and Berklee faculty member Norm Zocher  wrote an arrangement of “Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)” in which the horns play a reharmonized version of the opening riff and Zocher himself takes the melody. “It’s very challenging to not make it sound cheesy,” Zocher says.The performance will be driven by the improvisation and innovative arrangements of the band rather than by the theatrics that were typically at the heart of Hendrix’s live performances. However, this doesn’t mean that the musicians won’t have a little fun with the show. “I do know how to play with my teeth, so maybe I’ll do that,” Zocher says, laughing.

Often described as a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/26/Crimson-student-life/"">puzzling and ineffective bureaucratic machine, Harvard’s Office of Student Life has the potential to greatly benefit from the recent <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/24/lassonde-dean-student-life/"">appointment of Stephen Lassonde as its dean. Lassonde's extensive experience as a superintendent and advocate of student residential life positions him well to reshape the OSL into a friendlier institution and more strongly support the activities of undergraduate student organizations.Designed to serve as the focal point of extracurricular life at the College and an important source of guidance for Harvard’s more than 400 extracurricular organiations, the OSL has not yet measured up to its promise. A number of weak points in the way student life is conducted at Harvard could stand for substantial reform. The lack of an intuitive application process for student organization grants, an excessively tight <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/10/osl-excessive-regulations/"">regulation of undergraduate activities, as well as the current processes of annual re-registration and room booking that student groups undergo have been described as cumbersome and contribute to the unfriendly and counterproductive image that the OSL holds. Dean of Calhoun College at Yale and later Deputy Dean of the College at Brown, Lassonde brings to Harvard the experience of a seasoned, well-versed administrator. At Brown, Lassonde garnered a reputation as an accessible and unpretentious advisor, despite his high rank in the university’s hierarchy. Throughout his <a href=""http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/01/23/lassonde-to-step-down-to-serve-at-harvard/"">tenure, he maintained regular office hours open to all students, and self-reportedly tried to make himself a “resource for students” rather than a distant executive. Moreover, Lassonde made <a href=""http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/12/06/dean-accessibility-reduces-academic-warnings/"">efforts to expand the office hours of all university deans—an endeavor that he hoped would herald ever more lively and regular communication between students and administrators.Furthermore, Lassonde has had experience overseeing disciplinary proceedings and matters of academic integrity, having served on the Committee on Academic Integrity at Yale and the Committee on Academic Standing at Brown. This is especially relevant at Harvard in the wake of the Government 1310 cheating scandal. As Dean of Student Life, Lassonde will hopefully be able to serve as an effective point of reference for the students who were asked to withdraw from the College as they resume their studies.Lassonde has clearly learned the right lessons from his time at Brown, <a href=""http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/12/06/dean-accessibility-reduces-academic-warnings/"">telling the Brown Daily Herald that “[h]aving conversations with students [made] a difference” during his time there. Building upon the work of former Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and upon his background, Lassonde could conceivably steer the OSL in a direction that is friendlier to students. While most of the interactions that Harvard undergraduates have with the office are currently burdensome or unpleasant, we hope that its new leadership will make for an improved Office of Student Life at Harvard.

A bevy of school records fell this weekend as the Harvard men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams bested their competition in the HYP dual meet at DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J.For the men’s team (8-0, 6-0 Ivy), the win was a piece of history, the first time an Ivy opponent has beaten Princeton at home and ensured a share of the dual meet title. The squad bested the Tigers by a margin of 200-153 and topped the Bulldogs, 292-61.For the women (9-0, 7-0 Ivy), the win closed out a second consecutive undefeated conference season, a feat the Crimson hadn’t accomplished for six years. The team swept Yale, 209-89, and Princeton, 199-99.“It was an awesome accomplishment to have beaten them in their own pool,” junior Oliver Lee said. “Our team is stronger than it has ever been, and that we are breaking school records in-season complements our victory over Princeton in their own pool.”Lee had a superlative performance during the meet, breaking three school records and turning in two other times that were the second fastest in program history. He earned an individual record in the 50 free with a time of 19.74, eclipsing junior Chris Satterthwaite’s previous time of 19.84.
Lee and Satterthwaite joined sophomore Griffin Schumacher and junior Will Brophy to set the record in the 200 free relay in 1.18.71. Later in the meet, Lee teamed up with Schumacher and juniors Jack Pretto and Chuck Katis with a record time of 1.27.18 in the 200 medley relay.Lee swam five races total, capturing first place in every single event. The team captured a win in 14 of the 19 events through the weekend.“I was really happy with my own swims,” Lee said. “Personal bests when we aren’t yet tapered are always good. Going into Ivy’s, our team is excited and hoping to send a solid group to NCAA’s.”Going into Ivy League Championships, Lee is no stranger to success. Last year, as a sophomore, he raced in the 200 and 400 free relay teams that set earlier school records at the championship meet.Newer to the conference title race is freshman Kendall Crawford, who also had a banner weekend at Princeton. Crawford set school records in the 100 backstroke with a time of 53.59 and 100 butterfly, finishing in 53.79. She also won the 200 backstroke in 1:55.16, with teammates Danielle Lee, Caroline Weaver and Deirdre Clute trailing behind.“We walked onto Princeton’s deck, and from the first step off the bus, we dominated,” Crawford said. “Getting two records was so beyond anything I’d ever expected. The atmosphere was so exciting and the excitement from the team fueled better and better swims. Everyone had great swims and each race led off to the other. Everything was perfect.”Crawford has been breaking Harvard records since starting her collegiate career. In both of her first two meets, the freshman set landmark times for the Crimson in the 100 backstroke. Her time of 53.59 just eclipsed her previous record of 54.20, set at the Georgia Invitational on Dec. 2.Crawford has picked up at least two wins in every meet she has competed in this January.“[I] take each meet one step at a time,” Crawford said. “Closing out the season, I’d love to be able to help the team win an Ivy League championship…. It’s such a great team to be part of, and to be able to help it is just the best feeling. I guess personally I’d love to make NCAA’s. To be able to be a part of representing Harvard on a national level would be incredible.”The rookie has her sights set beyond this season, which continues on Feb. 28 at Ivy Championships, and into the future. The Crimson enters the post-dual meet season with 14 straight wins and last year’s title on its record. With the strong crop of freshmen, including Crawford, the speed they carry doesn’t appear to be going away soon.“I’m so honored to be able to help this team,” Crawford said. “I want to help start a dynasty of Harvard swimming as being the ones to beat. Princeton has won the past couple of years prior to 2011-12. I want to be able to start something new, start a Harvard dynasty.

“Girard, Girard. It’s all your fault, it’s all your fault.”After the Eagles’ third goal of the game, the Boston College student section heckled Girard with its traditional and well-rehearsed “sieve” cheer.Let the record show that the Crimson’s loss was by no stretch Raphael Girard’s fault. In fact, the junior goaltender may have been Harvard’s best man on the ice Monday night.With two minutes left in the second period, Girard and his teammates seemed poised to achieve high-scale robbery on ice. The Eagles peppered the Crimson with shots during the second frame, yet Girard stood tall in net through 29 Boston College shots on goal.But a sharp goaltender would not be enough to carry Harvard (5-15-1, 3-12-0 ECAC) to its first Beanpot final in five years thanks to an unrelenting Eagles forecheck. Boston College (16-7-2, 12-6-1 HE) found the back of the net on its final two shots of the period as the defending NCAA and Beanpot champions rolled to a 4-1 win over the struggling Crimson.
Girard finished the night with 42 saves as the Eagles outshot Harvard, 46-20. Making his first Beanpot start, the Quebecois did show some nerves early in the contest, tripping on a post the first time he was forced to handle the puck. But the junior quickly found a groove.“I’ve been waiting for quite awhile,” Girard said. “I was really eager to get in the game. I was really nervous at the start… But I was just trying to go out there and be as aggressive as I could and be really poised because [BC] has a lot of poised players.”In the first, Girard turned away six shots to stop a buzzing Boston College power play. In the second, he stuffed BC captain Pat Mullane on a shorthanded break-away.When the Eagles did break through, Girard had little chance. Boston College’s second strike of the game came on a crisply-executed cross-rink pass that left Girard stranded on the other side of the net. Seconds later, Michael Matheson found a clear shooting lane to put the Eagles up, 3-0, into the final intermission.Despite the high shots on goal count, Girard did receive plenty of help from his teammates. Harvard skaters blocked 21 of Boston College’s 79 attempted shots.POWERLESS ON THE POWER PLAYIt is official: Harvard has gone from first to worst on the power play.A year ago, the Crimson led the NCAA with a 27.4 percent success rate on the power play. After going 0-for-3 with the man advantage Monday, Harvard’s power play unit now ranks 59th out of 59 D-I teams.“I think our power play is something that we’re going to need to improve if we’re going to have some success down the stretch,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We have juggled a bunch of guys in and out of the line-up, just got Kyle Criscuolo back. It’s something that we’ll continue to work on.”The Crimson struggled to set up a focused attack during each of its three 5-on-4 opportunities. The Boston College penalty kill chewed valuable seconds off the clock with key faceoff wins and clean clears. Despite promising looks from freshman Jimmy Vesey and senior Alex Fallstrom, Harvard had some difficulty establishing the zone and cycling the puck.

On Nov. 7, 2012, Barack Obama was reelected as President of the United States.  For many hopeful Republicans, that same night marked an arguably bigger event—Mitt Romney lost. After months of parading around the ideal moderate-conservative candidate, pundits on the right were shocked by the final outcome. Staunch fiscal conservatives believe the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/20/moderate-republicans_n_2335063.html"">Republican Party’s inability to shift with modern social trends was the reason for the loss, while others claimed it was <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/politicaljunkie/2012/11/12/164756302/who-gets-the-blame-for-the-romney-loss-the-tea-party-has-a-theory"">Romney’s moderate stance on social issues that forced millions of Republicans to not even show up on voting day.I believe both sides are right.Modern social conservatism has been branded by its reactionary positions to the hyper-sexualized revolution of the 1960s. The movement has become too narrowly defined and has greatly divided the Republican Party between those who are too afraid to defend those positions and those who fervently support them at all costs. Not to diminish the importance of various positions held on the two most controversial issues associated with social conservatism—abortion and same-sex marriage—but these issues have pigeonholed the Republican Party in a very vulnerable, defensive position. While the party platform does not need to necessarily abandon these ideas, the party must shift its focus. Rather than promoting social conservatism as a force resistant to change, Republicans need to boldly propose forward-moving ideas that emphatically promote traditional valuesSocial conservatism is at the heart of the Republican movement. Though fiscal conservatives and libertarians are ready to do away with social conservatives and their seemingly aggressive stances on particular issues, the principles of those groups present an incomplete solution when not embracing their inherent roots in social conservatism. Central to Republican ideology is the belief that government should be limited in both size and influence. But a party cannot push for a society of individuals free from excessive government without helping them build the necessary societal support systems around them.In the past, these support systems used to be validated from social values that easily resonated with the majority of Americans. However, we are currently living in an America in which <a href=""http://newsone.com/1195075/children-single-parents-u-s-american/"">25 percent of children are being raised in single-parent households, <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;ved=0CHoQFjAJ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.divorce.usu.edu%2Ffiles%2Fuploads%2FLesson3.pdf&amp;ei=1jYQUYf6GcaQ0QHHrIBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGav45pibLrarVncfwFc_WAg0parg&amp;bvm=bv.41867550,d.dmQ"">50 percent of marriages end in divorce, and only <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-08-13/national/35491519_1_new-atheism-atheist-groups-new-atheists"">60 percent of Americans self-identify as “religious.” We are fortunate to live in a country where we are free to believe, say, and do as we please. Yet without support, this has translated into the abandonment and sometimes purposeful rejection of the traditional ideas that helped build this nation. We ignore the free and willing strength of the people—grounded in various forms of faith in civil society, families, and God—that was once crucial in guiding our intrinsic American values.
The leadership of the Republican Party either thinks that the values of community strength are already implied or is otherwise too afraid to appear “backward” in its societal beliefs. Either way, the public is not getting the whole message. Today, the general population has a sense of distrust toward establishments such as marriage, family, and religious groups, as there is no voice to protect the permanency of these institutions. This is what the Republican Party needs to do. It should look at the general public and see this clearly identifiable void of strength in the social sphere. As such, it should give Americans viable solutions and policies that will restore trust in these communities.Alexis de Tocqueville said, “I cannot help fearing that men may reach a point where they look on…every social advance as a first step toward revolution, and they may absolutely refuse to move at all.” Understandably, I think many would argue that this quote represents everything that appears so wrong with what has been considered as today’s social conservative movement. But if the Republican Party can revert to original, more-generalized forms of true social conservatism, the different factions of the Party can reunite in positively initiating and inspiring the American public. No longer can the Republican Party, or the nation, afford to let social conservatism—real social conservatism—be seen as dead weight holding Americans back. Social conservatism as a greater fundamental ideology needs to be redefined, emphasized, and embraced. It is an affirmative reminder of the true potential and greatness of the American people. The people are ready, and all we need now is a strong Republican Party to lead the way.Devi R. Nair ’16 lives in Weld Hall.

Hundreds of people packed The Middle East’s downstairs Wednesday to celebrate the 20th anniversary of The Pharcyde’s debut album, “Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde,” which was performed from start to finish by members of the original group.“We been doin’ this shit since 1993!” yelled original Pharcyde member Slimkid3 at one point, polling the concertgoers about the decades they were born in. A vast majority of the crowd hailed from the 80s, while a smaller contingent, closer to the stage, were children of the 90s. Mathematically that meant that the majority of the people in the crowd were at most 12 years old when “Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde” was released in 1992, coming as an antidote to the more hardcore gangsta rap coming from the west coast. (At one point in the show, Fatlip mentioned “the east coast showin’ us love” even when the tension between east and west was at its zenith.) Presumably, many in the audience discovered the album years after its initial release, and so one could also assume that the younger showgoers were not there to celebrate two decades of the album’s existence as much as to hear an album that has always been regarded as “classic.”But regardless of when and where each attendee discovered Bizarre Ride, the level of enthusiasm for the album was universally high at The Middle East. Former Pharcyde members Slimkid3 and Fatlip as well as producers J-Swift and LA Jay hit the stage to perform, and the atmosphere remained electric from the first track to the last. (The group is not technically allowed to tour as The Pharcyde. That right belongs to the group’s other two members, Imani and Bootie Brown.) “Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde” is a wonderful relic of old-school hip-hop, a lighthearted romp of an album more suited to the live stage than a pair of earbuds. It’s the kind of album you’d imagine playing during a house party (or a “House Party”).The show got energized quickly, with the audience bouncing along to “Oh Shit”—a song titled with, depending on the context, a worried exclamation or a phrase to mutter when something exciting is about to happen. At The Middle East, it was the latter.Supplementing the group were images and video, projected behind the musicians, that corresponded to each track. “Oh Shit” ended with a photo of someone lying down, wearing pants bearing the titular stain. That just about sums up the tone of the show: exciting, impressive, sweaty, and unafraid of the occasional poop joke.
Many of the tracks from Bizarre Ride are easy to sing along to, even if you’ve never heard them before. Most of the choruses are just a single repeated lyric. The crowd chanted along, asking, “Who is the nigga in charge over here? / Who is the nigga in charge?” on “I’m That Type of Nigga” and chanting “ee ah oo ah ah” on “Soul Flower.”Slimkid3, Fatlip and crew kept the energy going throughout, interacting with the crowd, grabbing phones from the audience in order to take pictures, and—much to the chagrin of security—encouraging members to crowd surf. The room was crowded, but not nearly dense enough to sustain anyone aloft for more than a few seconds. During “Passin’ Me By,” one of the less boisterous tracks on the album but also its most popular cut, audience participation peaked as everyone sang along to the chorus.The crew carried it home, performing “Quinton’s On The Way (skit)” and “Pack The Pipe” with a lot of audience support. “This isn’t a beer song. This is a weed song,” Slimkid3 announced as the audience cheered. “The pipe, the pipe, let’s pack the pipe!” they chanted.The album performance came to a close with “Return of the B-Boy,” complete with a breakdancing section particularly impressive given that everyone who was on stage is in their early 40s. But while the group’s faces may show signs of aging, their energy and limberness onstage do not. Even after bouncing around onstage for an hour, nobody looked or sounded closer to retirement than they did on the album 20 years ago.The final song of the night, “Runnin’,” off of the group’s second album, was a tribute to J Dilla, a deceased producer great. And following that, Slimkid3 announced that the group was working on new material. If that material is nearly as electric as last Wednesday’s performance, it can’t come soon enough.—Staff writer Brian Feldman can be reached at bfeldman@college.harvard.edu

“Photos, no matter how compelling or evocative, draw us in to learn more,” Lesley University President Joseph Moore said at the beginning of a panel discussion on photojournalism and the Arab Spring. The Wednesday discussion at Lesley’s Washburn Auditorium featured panelists Karim Ben Khelifa, a photojournalist and Nieman Fellow, Ludovic Blecher, editor-in-chief of Libération.fr and also a Nieman Fellow, and Judith E. Matloff ’81, a faculty member at the Columbia Journalism School. During the talk, the panelists described the lives of the people behind the camera and emphasized the need for journalists to get up-close views of their subjects while staying safe. The discussion was presented in conjunction with “Revolutions: Photographs of the Arab Spring,” an exhibition of Rémi Ochlik’s photographs on display until February 22 at the Art Institute of Boston. Ochlik, whose photographs of protests in the Middle East were shown on a screen behind the panelists, was killed in Syria a year ago at age 28. Ochlik is just one of the over 50 journalists, both foreign and local, who lost their lives in Syria in 2012. Though the discussion ranged from personal anecdotes of work in the field to comments on the technical work of editors, Khelifa, Matloff, and Blecher all spoke of appreciation for Ochlik and the other journalists who have lost their lives while fighting to communicate stories to the world.  “For me, the camera is nothing: [the important thing is] how you connect to the story and people around you,” said Khelifa. For him, safety in a conflict area often depended on his ability to blend into the crowd. Khelifa said that in Arab countries he grows a beard and often refuses to wear the flak jacket that would label him a member of the foreign press. 
 Khelifa described a situation in which he was forced to use his iPhone instead of his big, professional camera. “For the first time, I was invisible,” he said. He was able to get closer to the action using the iPhone as a cover; he was no longer an intruding reporter, but just another young man with a phone. Indeed, taking photographs is no longer a privilege limited to members of the press with fancy cameras, a fact the panelists returned to in their discussion. Many protesters in Arab countries take their own phone pictures to update their Twitter or Instagram followers on the action; Khelifa said his iPhone photos have even been published in professional news outlets such as The Daily Beast.  Blecher similarly discussed the shift from the professional photographer to the citizen reporter. As an editor, Blecher said, he spends a lot of time sifting through massive amounts of information for pieces that are credible, clear, and accurate. “Many voices [come] from the citizens using the Internet to express their emotions,”  Blecher said. In particular, he mentioned social media sources like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. “The job of the journalist has always been to choose what is important and what is not,” he said. With so many places to turn to for information, Blecher said that he would choose to publish photos from journalists like Khelifa over local Twitter updates because professional journalists can be held accountable for the information they report. Matloff joked that when she started reporting, information was spread through telegrams, not Instagram. Matloff was a foreign correspondent for 20 years in 62 countries and is now a contributing editor at the Columbia Journalism Review, where she has written about another type of revolution—that of women in journalism. According to Matloff, there are more females out in the field than when she started reporting. But while both men and women risk their lives when they go into countries of conflict, Matloff proposed that women especially approach the job with caution. Matloff mentioned the high rates of sexual harassment and rape in violent political areas and the increased prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Arab countries as factors that might discourage women from reporting abroad. Because of the these dangers, getting close to the action in order to take photos and relay stories to the world might be even riskier for women. There are still many advancements to be made in terms of ensuring women are able to prevent harassment and rape in foreign countries, Matloff said.  For both men and women, Khelifa said, it is a brave and personal choice to go to these dangerous places, and returning with meaningful photos requires an immense amount of dedication to the cause. “You need to care, you need commitment, you need resilience, and you need to be a little bit nuts,” said Khelifa.—Staff writer Virginia R.

Yoko Ogawa’s short story collection “Revenge” begins and ends with the discovery of a six-year-old boy’s corpse folded up inside a refrigerator. Another author might have engineered such a specifically macabre framework with the goal of explaining the circumstances of the child’s death and his placement in the refrigerator throughout the collection’s action. Ogawa’s prose, in opting to shroud the details of the boy’s death, instead casts a sense of unease and suspicion that carries throughout the collection, only to be left vexingly unresolved by the final rediscovery of the still unexplained corpse.Ogawa pulls the reader into a stiflingly morbid universe without ever directly focusing her lens on the dark happenings, and the work thus suffers from an overreliance on disconnected rhetoric and a pervasive nightmarish slowness. Her strategy of shrouding the bloody deaths and tortuous lives is completed by focusing instead on symbolic use of the mundane—of kiwis and tomatoes, of cakes and aging tigers. Ultimately, while such a strategy could work to augment fear of the unknown by avoiding the outright macabre, “Revenge” fails as a lesson in disassembly and distraction that ultimately pushes the work a step too far from its gory core, leaving the action congealed.The slim volume contains 11 short stories, all of which revolve around the same cast of uncompromisingly reserved characters. Their dovetailing stories form a dark narrative marked by heartbreak and physical trauma—usually highlighted in each story’s climactic scene, in which scenes of murder and mutilation are detailed in elegant and spare prose. In the unsubtly titled “Welcome to the Museum of Torture,” Ogawa’s protagonist meditates on the possibility of torturing her boyfriend with strand-by-strand hair removal, “And then I’ll pluck out his hair…They’ll flutter down like insects with long wings. I’ll enjoy that tiny bit of resistance each time I pluck a hair, the feeling of the skin ripping, of fat popping to the surface.” This moment is demonstrative of the piece’s most gruesome scenes—there is an uncomfortable sense of disconnection in the speaker’s voice, a formality and control that leeches the violence from the act and leaves the reader with a sense of nausea that the story refuses to relieve. It’s an effective technique in moderation, but as Ogawa applies it again and again the disaffection and unreality become too strong, and the reader is forced out of sympathy with such closed characters.The monotony of narrative distance is aggravated by the heavy-handed use of domestic tropes—usually food-centered—that prevent true immersion. For example, strawberry shortcake appears in the first story, “Afternoon at the Bakery,” as an obvious symbol of domestic life gone wrong. The narrator finds herself in an empty bakery and waits for hours to purchase a strawberry shortcake to celebrate the anniversary of her son’s death. As she waits, she recalls the ruined cake that rotted after her son’s death years ago: “I passed my days watching it rot. First, the cream turned brown and separated from the fat, staining the cellophane wrapper. Then the strawberries dried out, wrinkling up like the heads of deformed babies.” This description, at once grotesque and clinical, is followed by a meditation on the still-fresh shortcakes behind the bakery counter in the present moment: “Each was topped with three whole strawberries. They looked perfectly preserved, no sign of mold.” The final line of the story is a spoken request for “‘two strawberry shortcakes, please.’” The relentless repetition of the cakes throughout this short story eventually begins to read as an affected obsession, as opposed to a haunting refrain. Ogawa does not relent, including strawberry shortcakes and mentions of strawberries and cream throughout many of the following stories in the collection. As these tropes echo through every story, they become gimmicky and technically clumsy—an obvious attempt to infuse the dark material with a contrasting element of the everyday. As such, the pastries—along with other over-used symbols like tomatoes and kiwis—become a kind of distracting shorthand for a foil which is never fully realized.In the penultimate piece, “Tomatoes and the Full Moon,” many of the characters who have starred individually in the previous stories come together to reach an uneasy pseudo-union. An elderly woman who has been seen earlier in the collection as a young aspiring novelist and  an absentminded stepmother is dealing with the suspected theft of her novel’s manuscript by a possibly imaginary hunchback at a seaside resort. A man visiting the hotel for work reminds her of a man earlier in her life who saved her and her stepson from a hypothermic death, and given the shaky timeline of the book as a whole, he could potentially be this same man. The two of them have close ties to every major player within the collection and appear independently of one another often throughout the book.
Here, then, is the moment when the disparate threads of the collection are meant to come together to complete an eerie and compelling universe through which these characters trace their sorrowful trajectories. Whenever a character reappears—which happens with whiplash frequency towards the end of the book—the reader is tempted to turn back through the past stories and find his or her other appearances, but ultimately the plot lines are not compelling enough to merit such effort. These moments, engineered to spark recognition and motivate further study of the characters throughout the narrative, fall flat due to the collections’ lack of momentum.Ogawa’s collection seems engineered to haunt. The self-awareness of the structure and its rendering in delicate and biting prose, when coupled with the omnipresent tropes of domesticity, create a sense of being in a waking dream. The stories aspire to be inescapable—repetitious as only nightmares can be. However, the techniques that Ogawa employs towards this end are clumsy and wear thin from overuse. With a lighter hand or an even shorter page count, Ogawa’s efforts would bear strange and horrifying fruit in the minds of her readers. However, as Ogawa leans harder and harder on her thematic crutches, she cripples even the most disturbing and effective moments in the collection, relegating the work as a whole to that classification which never describes a terrifying nightmare—forgettable.—Sorrel L.

Last month, the students, alumni, and workers in the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition won a great victory: President Drew G. Faust announced that Harvard would, for the first time, create a Social Choice Fund to invest designated alumni donations in a socially responsible manner. This is certainly an important step—and the fact that more than 450 people donated to the Fair Harvard Fund last spring indicates how many alums want Harvard to invest its money for social good. Harvard’s speedy acknowledgement of this interest bodes well for the future of student activism.Yet, one important detail of Harvard’s announcement has thus far been largely overlooked. Although Harvard will create a Social Choice fund on July 1, this fund <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">will not be part of Harvard’s $31 billion endowment and the Harvard Management Company will not manage it. Instead, Harvard has cleverly maintained the position of its endowment as removed from moral or ethical considerations. Members of the Harvard community must keep working if they truly want our university to use its money responsibly.Harvard invests its endowment with principles generally <a href=""http://www.tellus.org/publications/files/endowmentcrisis.pdf"">in accordance with modern portfolio theory, which requires that no limitations be placed on the investments a fund can make in order to maximize returns. Although environmental, social, and governance considerations <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/23/faust-discusses-investments/"">may come into play when the university considers the long-term sustainability of an investment, the Harvard Management Company fundamentally makes investment decisions simply based on what it thinks will earn it the most profit.For example, Harvard <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/1/hei-hotels-reinvest-hmc/"">declared last year that it would not reinvest in HEI Hotels and Resorts, a hotel company accussed of labor rights violations (for example, HEI owns the Le Meridien Cambridge hotel in Central Square, currently involved in a labor dispute and under <a href=""http://www.cambridgeday.com/2012/10/10/le-meridien-hotel-workers-plan-boycott-of-their-own-employer-to-rally-thursday/"">boycott by its own workers). However, although Brown University <a href=""http://www.browndailyherald.com/2011/01/27/advisory-committee-dont-reinvest-in-hei/"">condemned HEI’s labor practices in its own decision not to reinvest, the Harvard Gazette reported that Harvard’s decision was simply based on “portfolio” reasons.Of course, this should not be discouraging to student activists, like those in the Student Labor Action Movement who advocated for non-reinvestment in HEI and those in Students for a Just and Stable Future currently advocating for Harvard to divest its endowment from corporations with large fossil fuel holdings. One of the factors taken into consideration when deciding the usefulness of an investment is undoubtedly public image. If students, alumni, and other community members can make a university look poor enough for continuing to invest in a destructive industry or company, the threat of decreased alumni donations and poor public relations may encourage the university to cede to student demands—whether or not they market their decision as a move towards social responsibility or a “portfolio” decision. If we cannot appeal to the ethics of the university, at least we can appeal to the ethics of its community.
But more fundamentally, it is time to question the relevance of modern portfolio theory to the Harvard Management Company’s endowment. After all, it is ridiculous to think that HMC could possibly select the “best” investments from the entire field of possible investments. Any choices of what to invest in are subjective, dependent upon human choice. This became obvious in 2008, when Harvard’s endowment <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/9/10/harvard-endowment-largest-in-higher-education/"">plummeted 27 percent, much more than the 18 percent median <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125261209050800581.html"">drop that large endowments faced. This suggests that the Harvard Management Company had invested its endowment disproportionately in financial corporations like Goldman Sachs, which suffered much more in the financial crisis than the average company.Proponents of socially responsible investment often<a href=""http://funds.rbcgam.com/_assets-custom/pdf/RBC-GAM-does-SRI-hurt-investment-returns.pdf""> cite studies demonstrating that funds that engage in socially responsible investing, especially when they employ only negative screens to screen out a few egregiously irresponsible companies, have comparable returns to funds that do not specifically do socially responsible investment. While this may be true, this rhetoric ignores the moral motivation behind socially responsible investing: to actually do significant good for the world. If Harvard wants to act like the non-profit that it is, it must abandon the idea that its endowment’s investments are entirely separate from its moral purview as a university—and it must stop insisting that the endowment is now invested in accordance to some perfectly balanced formula to maximize returns.Creating a social choice fund that exists outside of the endowment is an important first step. But ultimately, if students and other Harvard community members truly want their university to act responsibly, they must demand that Harvard invest its entire endowment in a socially responsible manner—and give up on the myth of modern portfolio theory.Sandra Y.

“The Servant of Two Masters” is aptly titled—it overextends in its desire to embrace two different genres of dramatic expression, and, like its title character, risks not entirely satisfying either group. This new adaptation, performed by the Yale Repertory Theatre and directed by Christopher Bayes, attempts to satisfy the parameters of traditional commedia dell’arte and also relate to a contemporary crowd. The production, which plays at the Paramount Center Mainstage through Sunday, is at times confusing; the moments when the actors puncture the commedia with meta-commentary and modern jokes hamper the overall aesthetic. Traditionally, actors in commedia dell’arte play stock types, a goal that “The Servant” achieves quite well. Beatrice (Sarah Agnew) disguises herself as her dead brother and orders her servant Truffaldino (Steven Epp) to handle her belongings when Beatrice’s lover Florindo (Randy Reyes) arrives in town. Truffaldino offers to serve Florindo as well and meddles in both his masters’ dealings. Predictably, Truffaldino fails to get away with secretly serving both masters at the same time but still wins the heart of the servant girl Smeraldina (Liz Wisan).  If some of the comedy succeeds in this play, it is because the actors each embody their type with a delightful generosity of body language. Like a demented array of Pez dispensers, they lean back their furiously bobbing heads every so often and open their mouths to sing pseudo-opera or roar replies to other characters. Consistent with the commedia, each character has a physical tic that recurs each time he or she enters the stage. As Florindo,  Reyes holds his arms out, trembling all over, each time he is overcome by emotion. Wisan, as Smeraldina, is hilariously gung-ho, and in her signature gesture she lifts her arms vigorously and pumps them over her head. Epp, as Truffaldino, frequently stumbles or drops important papers.
 However, the play’s modern humor was largely hit-or-miss. The modern jokes that the actors improvised into the script sacrifice the comic unity of the dell’arte. In a running gag, Epp casts himself as a starving Boston graduate student, frequently making asides like, “I’m working on my doctoral dissertation,” and, “You can’t throw a rock in this town without hitting a Ph.D.” He also wonders—perhaps a little too often—about being an actor in the play; several times he asks, “Seriously, when is the play going to begin?” or, “Is that the exit door?” Comments like these bring  Truffaldino out of the plot and presents him as simply a hapless actor on the stage. However, to clear up any doubts about the intended comedy, many of the actions onstage are accompanied by musical cues. Camped on the edge of the stage, a violinist and an accordionist play melodramatic ditties when a character appears or some crisis occurs to herald an ironic or whimsical tone. Intimate, less ironic music—or no music at all—accompanies Truffaldino’s more serious moments. At the end of the play, when Truffaldino has been found out, he can only stare at the empty stage without musical accompaniment or even human voice. The music serves to orient the humor, and was effective in tone-setting, more tastefully comic than the comparatively crude throwaways like Epp’s quippy one-liners.  The set, designed by Katherine Akiko Day, includes a curtain backdrop painted with clouds. At the end of the play, Truffaldino accidentally pulls down the backdrop, leaving a bare wall that reveals the actors to be just performers in a play. It is an oddly serious conclusion to a play so invested in traditional commedia. After Truffaldino pulls down the curtain, the resulting aesthetic seems to fall short of the intended emotion. This and other deviations from dell’arte such as the modern jokes and meta-commentary are ultimately incongruous with its more traditional comic delivery. There is something perhaps too precious about the final scene, when the backdrop comes down and lovers Truffaldino and Smeraldina disappear into the night as if in a fairy tale.Less gratifying in its tooth-grinding, modern-day humor and at times irritatingly insistent on  employing modern-day humor, “The Servant” is otherwise wonderfully acted, and it succeeds in its better moments through its focus on traditional comic tropes. —Staff writer Victoria Zhuang can be reached at vzhuang@college.harvard.edu.

Something any shopping trip can teach you is that one size does not fit all. That amazing top your friend was raving about can leave you feeling like you've made a major faux pas. And of course, there's always the worry that the ahead-of-the-curve discovery that fits you perfectly this semester will be discovered by the world and their linkmate the next. Shopping, whichever way you look at it, can be stressful.<!--more-->Sometimes you go window-shopping and immediately find something you just have to have. Occasionally, that gem you've been coveting online turns out to look just as good in person.  But all too often, the cute little number that seemed like such a good idea during the buzz of your shopping trip turns out to be the academic equivalent of sporting socks and Crocs (or honestly, just Crocs alone).We've all been there, and even Harvard understands that sometimes it takes you more than the short five days of shopping week to find an ensemble you can rock all semester.So when you realize that you'll have to skip lunch the next few months if you want to keep your purchase, remember the add/drop form, the world's best return policy. Flyby is here to remind you: fret not if your shopping trip takes a little longer than expected. Keep searching for that perfect fit (at least until you lose the receipt for your textbooks, or until that return policy expires on February 25th). And never settle for Crocs.

""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)""Fall Out Boy, ""Save Rock and Roll""Fall Out Boy are a national treasure. They recently came screaming back from a three-year break with a new single, “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)”. The latest track from pop punk’s darlings is strange in the way of creatures from the Mariana Trench—the group has emerged from the depths of hiatus grotesquely changed. Between hair-metal cries of “fire” (pronounced “fiyah”) and a music video featuring 2 Chainz (formerly known as Tity Boi), it feels as if the band is trying its hardest to confuse its longtime fans. The song has none of the trademark wordplay or infectious riffs of classic Fall Out Boy. Pete Wentz, what hath thou wrought?""So Many Details""Toro y Moi, ""Anything in Return""
Multilingually named artist and producer Toro y Moi (real name Chazwick Bundick) is famed for his ability to seamlessly blend dark, almost sinister sonic elements into seemingly simple and poppy songs. “So Many Details” is a shining example of this style, with staccato synth notes in minor modes punctuating Bundick’s sensual and understated vocals. The tension between the lyrics and the production delicately underscores Bundick’s romantic contemplation. “So Many Details” plays like a nighttime ocean swim: dangerous, refreshing, and alluring. Toro y Moi makes it clear with this single that he has depth that far surpasses the superficial charms of a typical chillwave artist.""Suit and Tie""Justin Timberlake, ""The 20/20 Experience""Justin Timberlake has released a single as inscrutable as his plans for his upcoming album. “Suit and Tie” is so very close to being a classic JT jam, filled with funk and falsetto that gets fans yelling and dogs howling, but in the end, it falls short. Jay-Z’s verse is an awkward interruption, more like a lazy cameo than a complementary aside, and is indicative of the song’s larger failure to coalesce. The jerky nature detracts from the Curtis Mayfield feel that Timberlake nearly captures. This song is only relevant because it is a Justin Timberlake song, and after JT’s six-year hiatus, fans will take whatever they can get.—Staff writer Alexander Tang can be reached at tang@college.harvard.edu

The social anthropology department is thinking about group interactions and new furniture as it makes plans to move from William James Hall on Kirkland Street to Tozzer Library on Divinity Ave.The relocation—slated to be completed in 2014— represents an effort to foster greater departmental unity between social anthropology and anthropology’s archeology program, which is currently located adjacent to Tozzer in the Peabody Museum.The project is estimated to cost at least $12 million, according to anthropology department chair Gary Urton, and officially began about three weeks ago. It will feature a complete renovation of Tozzer Library including the addition of two new floors dedicated to social anthropology. Faculty expect to move to their new offices in May of 2014.Faculty response to the move has been “really enthusiastic,” said Urton.“They’re getting new offices in the Tozzer building,” he said. “They will have a much clearer sense of themselves as being a unit that’s devoted to the work that they are doing.”
Lynne M. Schmelz, librarian for the sciences at Harvard, said that she is similarly eager for the construction to conclude.“There will be new space for the students to visit,” she said. “That’s exciting for the library.”The anthropology department began considering consolidation after human and evolutionary biology, formerly known as biological anthropology, became its own separate department in 2009.“We just felt that it was very important to reestablish, to reexamine, what unites us,” Urton said.Anthropology professor Mary M. Steedly—a member of a project planning committee comprised of faculty members, project architects, and designers—said she believes the construction on Tozzer Library will create “newly renovated spaces up-to-the-minute technologically and designed with efficiency and comfort in mind.” She added that the project will also allow the social anthropology program to make greater use of the Peabody Museum’s collections.Social anthropology’s new home will accommodate about 15 faculty, with some additional office space for emeritus faculty members and guest faculty, said Urton.“One of the nicest things about the plan is that it creates—in the middle of the space—an open common area with a skylight that’s really going to be beautiful,” said Steedly. “It’s been a really exciting experience seeing this all come together—it’s going to be a great improvement over the current situation.”—Staff writer Francesca Annicchiarico can be reached at fannicchiarico01@college.harvard.edu.

Despite the addition of a fourth sorority on campus, the number of women who signed up for sorority recruitment at Harvard this year remained constant from last.Approximately 250 women attended the first recruitment event for Harvard’s four sororities on Saturday, the same number as in 2012. Last year’s showing represented a small decrease from the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/1/rush-numbers-dip-slightly/"">record-breaking group of 268 women who showed up in 2011. Prior to 2011, recruitment classes <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/7/women-rush-sorority-number/"">averaged about 150 women.The recent stabilization of large rush numbers led to interest in <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/3/fourth-sorority-added-panhellenic/"">introducing a fourth sorority to campus. This year, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/3/alpha-phi-sororities-social/"">Alpha Phi joined Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma.After the conclusion of the second recruitment event on Wednesday, women will rank their sorority preferences. They will then receive invitations to attend further events.The procedures to rush Alpha Phi differ from the recruitment process for the other three. Women who attend the first two recruitment events have the opportunity to meet members from all four sororities. Because there are no current Harvard students in Alpha Phi, women from other school’s chapters of the sorority will come to host the first and second recruitment rounds along with the other three sororities. However, Alpha Phi will not hold a third or fourth round at the same time as the other three sororities, and will instead postpone recruitment events until the end of February. Therefore, women who were not offered bids by another sororities, chose not to join another sorority, or did not participate in the first rounds of recruitment at all will still be able to join Alpha Phi.
National standards require new chapters on a university campus to complete the recruitment process after the established sororities.“Right now, since [Alpha Phi has] not colonized yet, that’s the way national rules dictate recruitment has to be,” said Natalia Duarte ’14, vice president of recruitment for the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council.Regardless of a potential new member’s interest in joining Alpha Phi, the Panhellenic Coucil suggested that women attend the first two general recruitment events.“We really encourage girls who are thinking about joining a sorority to try and meet the girls from all four sororities before they make up their minds,” Duarte said.Women may still rush Alpha Phi without attending rush events this week.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

In the Boston University Gallery at the Stone Gallery's ""Teaching the Body,"" a new exhibit running until March 31, the boundary between art and medicine is shown to be not conventionally steadfast but unexpectedly fluid. The various featured artworks show how surgeons and their dissections have informed artists’ conceptions of the human form, and how artistic pieces were used in medicine long before the invention of modern medical imaging techniques. The exhibition follows artistic representations of human anatomy from 200 years ago up until the present day and concludes with unconventional, contemporary interpretations of the human body.“Before the arts or medicine in America were professionalized, they really had to collaborate,” exhibition curator Naomi H. Slipp says. Collaboration is the lynchpin of the exhibit’s artwork and is very much evident in the earlier works, such as Oscar Wallis’s detailed paintings of the musculature of the neck and forearm. “The artists had to turn to the doctors to teach them how to picture the body,” Slipp says. In turn, doctors would then use the resulting works as a teaching guide in a time when cadavers were rare. “[The exhibition has] been a really interesting way to see the two things converge,” says Joshua R. Buckno, assistant director of the Boston University Gallery.From Wallis’s precise anatomical watercolor plates to more conceptual modern works by Kiki Smith and Lisa Nilsson, the artworks themselves are surprisingly diverse in their treatment of rather exact medical content. The exhibition gives a clear view not only of the beauty of the human body but also of the patience and skill of the doctors and artists who collaborated to produce these works of art. The range of media is impressive, from sculptures in bronze and paper to treatises on the human body. There is even a small annex room where visitors can watch a videotaped anatomy lecture. “The great thing is just how full it is and how many dimensions can be approached,” Buckno says.The exhibit contains many photographs of the casts of classical sculptures from which many anatomical drawings were rendered. These casts represented an ideal of the human form not reflective of the diversity of depicted individuals, particularly in terms of race. “Picturing the body is very much about class, and it’s about gender, and it’s about race. A lot of the sort of politics of anatomy are really fascinating,” Slipp says. There are other parts of the exhibition where these issues arise: In Emma Augusta Cross’s 1886 sketch “Skulls and heads,” the crania of different races are depicted in a way that clearly likens non-Caucasian peoples to apes.Gender also informs some works in the exhibition. The restricted opportunities available to women in the past two centuries made their role in medical art all the more significant. One telling piece in the exhibit is a small sepia photograph from 1894 of a women’s sketching class. At the center of the photograph, one of the women confidently cradles a human skull among the easels and other students that surround her. The visible self-assurance of these women artists makes for a powerful image, particularly when juxtaposed against a written account elsewhere in the exhibition of female art students forced to wear veils to hide their identities while drawing nudes.
The exhibition explores the relationship between people and the body as well as the overlap between art and science. “I believe, as someone who’s very invested in the contemporary arts and art practices, that this kind of exhibition foregrounds just that relationship [between art and science],” says Kate McNamara, director and chief curator of the Boston University Art Gallery.  This relationship is still present today, as evidenced by the exhibition’s contemporary works like Nilsson’s rolled paper pieces. These appear at first glance to be sagittal slices of the head and neck but in fact are carefully constructed from coiled multicolored paper. Throughout the exhibit, the continued urge to understand and represent the human body is clear.Though “Teaching the Body” explores an interdisciplinary connection that has existed for centuries, it is by no means, as the title might have one believe, yet another chance to exhibit Renaissance prints and old Rembrandts. Instead, by drawing from a range of media and time periods—including the present day—“Teaching the Body” not only explores both art and anatomy but also demonstrates how the two historically linked disciplines still impact each other today.

“The Last Stand” opens with a policeman sitting on the side of a road at night eating a donut. This is not a particularly novel sight in television or film; cops eating donuts are an old trope. The issue with this flimsy initial scene, however, is the same problem that plagues the entire film. While covering well-tread ground is not itself a flaw, it can be a serious misstep without interesting characters or plot developments to make it more than just hackneyed. “The Last Stand” contains some competently shot action sequences, but its thin plot and shallow characters make it nothing more than a feeble echo of other films of its genre.“The Last Stand” is set in the fictional border town of Sommerton Junction, the inhabitants of which include sheriff and shell-shocked LAPD veteran Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Law enforcement in Sommerton Junction is usually uneventful, but this changes when FBI Agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) and Owens learn that a fugitive named Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) plans flee to Mexico through the town. With major reinforcements too far off to intervene, Owens and his misfit crew must act as the final barrier between Cortez and freedom.Schwarzenegger has been largely absent from cinema in recent years, but he is back to his old routine in “The Last Stand.” Sheriff Owens shoots big guns, beats up baddies, and delivers punchy one-liners. Schwarzenegger’s trademark stoic demeanor holds firm throughout the film, save for during a few emotional scenes that could have benefitted from him displaying more vulnerability. This is not an issue with Schwarzenegger alone; many principal characters lack complexity or nuance. As Agent Bannister, Whitaker does little more than bark commands to subordinates while making cartoonishly angry faces. Johnny Knoxville as Lewis Dinkum, a goofy firearm collector who provides weapons to Owens’s force, brings some laughs but seems only to be playing his “Jackass” persona with a Southern accent. Noriega’s Cortez delivers one monologue that seems to be the screenwriters’ attempt to indicate that he has a tragic backstory, but this is presented so briefly and abruptly that it has little impact.It may have been easier for the actors to portray memorable characters if the film didn’t suffer from such poor writing. The trite dialogue could have been thrown together by anyone who has seen a hodge-podge of action movies, and some characters deliver baffling punchlines that would be better suited for an episode of “Full House.” Perhaps writers Andrew Knauer, Jeffry Nachmanoff, and George Nolfi felt that this ’90s-era humor would help Schwarzenegger channel some of his “Terminator 2” self, but for the most part, the jokes fall flat. There are a few genuinely funny lines and several somewhat moving scenes, but not enough to make the movie clever or touching.The film also squanders a number of palpable opportunities to add depth or intrigue to the plot. Owens’s traumatic experiences as an LAPD officer are barely addressed. Cortez’s plan to escape to Mexico is at first mysterious and turns out to be rather ingenious, but it is revealed so nonchalantly that any mystique that the plot initially had vanishes without a payoff.
An action movie with relatively weak plots or characters can sometimes redeem these flaws with spectacular action, and “The Last Stand” has some impressive feats and striking sequences in the second half. But despite a few high points, there are blunders to be found in the these scenes as well. During a sequence in which the villain makes an escape from the FBI prison caravan, the camera flits wildly between different shots of police and the villains in a manner that is more disorienting than thrilling. Some of the action becomes repetitive and predictable; there are so many scenes centered on the souped-up Corvette ZR1 (identified by name and model by a character whose sole purpose in the movie seems to be doing so) that Cortez uses as his escape vehicle that one might begin to wonder whether the entire movie was conceived as an elaborate car commercial. This is particularly disappointing coming from director Jee-Woon Kim, whose films, such as “I Saw the Devil” and “The Good, the Bad, the Weird,” have garnered him a reputation for captivating, tightly choreographed action sequences.The few interesting stunts and funny moments in “The Last Stand” are ultimately insufficient to save the movie from its formulaic composition and unimaginative writing. In preparing for the explosive standoff between his police force and Cortez’s men, Owens, having dealt with similar situations in the past, solemnly warns one of his officers, “I know what’s coming.” It would be hard not to, sheriff.—Staff writer Chiemeka Ezie can be reached at cezie@college.harvard.edu.

Forget going platinum or snagging a Grammy nomination—the gold standard of musical success in today’s world is appearing on a 2 Chainz track. The list of individuals whose voices have been heard alongside 2 Chainz is a heavyweight lineup: Kanye West, Drake, John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, and, of course, famed musical satirist Thomas A. Lehrer ’46.Perhaps some explaining is in order. Last year, 2 Chainz’s record company sent a letter to the octogenarian Lehrer in Santa Cruz, Calif., asking permission to sample Lehrer’s song “The Old Dope Peddler” (a drugged-up parody of “The Old Lamplighter”) on 2 Chainz’s track “Dope Peddler.” Lehrer sent back a letter giving his consent, and then, as if to casually prove he hadn’t lost his sense of humor, tacked the following note onto the end: “My regards go out to Mr. Chainz. And may I call him 2?”Lehrer’s been happily retired from teaching math at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for several years now, but he’s been out of musical comedy for almost 40. It’s rare, almost unheard of, for a comedian’s material to remain relevant and resurface this long after he’s stopped producing new material. Comedy, especially satire, doesn’t usually have the shelf life of other genres—it often relies on referencing culture and contemporary events that become less and less relatable to newer generations. Is Lehrer’s star as bright as it was decades ago? Has his work stood the test of time? Sixty years after the release of his first record, what makes Lehrer relevant today?Looking beyond the locally revered “Fight Fiercely, Harvard” and Jell-O shots (which Lehrer allegedly invented while in the Army), the short answer is that Lehrer’s tongue-in-cheek style of illuminating absurdities—whether in politics or popular culture, whether through parody or satire—hasn’t been replicated since his retirement. Though that’s due partially to his irreverent, sometimes morbid approach, Lehrer’s attitude towards the production of his material was equally unique. Unlike many artists, Lehrer recognized that he was at his best when writing and performing songs was genuinely fun for him. As a result, he remained a purposeful outsider to the world of comedy, selectively employing his observational wit and eye for irony to construct a small but inimitable catalog of thought-provoking music.PEER REVUE

The only “dissertation” Lehrer ever finished was a poem he wrote at 15 (he never completed one on statistics started as a graduate student in Harvard’s math department). Entitled “Dissertation on Education,” the poem exhaustively enumerated Lehrer’s academic disinterests—Roman history, trigonometry, and poetry, among other topics—or “the things one must know to have ‘culture,’” the young Lehrer termed them. However, in the type of ironic twist that would later become one of his musical trademarks, Lehrer submitted the seemingly anti-education poem as his application essay to Harvard, ending it in a boldfaced appeal: “And I’ll work like a slave / And always behave / And maybe I’ll get into Harvard.” The quasi-reverse psychological ploy worked; Lehrer matriculated in 1944.“[Tom] had a way of looking at the world…from a distance. He would see things that people didn’t see,” recalls Lehrer’s classmate, musical collaborator, and lifelong friend David Z. Robinson ’46. During graduate school, Robinson says, Lehrer’s unique, witty viewpoint made him stand out even among extraordinarily smart people. “A group of 8 to 10 [of us] would eat every meal [together]. That included people like [Philip W. Anderson ’43], who later won a Nobel Prize,” Robinson says. “Tom was the intellectual center of this group.”After entering Harvard’s doctoral math program, Lehrer started to channel his wry sense of humor into more focused artistic output. In 1951, Lehrer wrote “The Physical Revue,” a comedic musical review session for the freshman-level physics class his friend Lewis M. Branscomb was teaching. For the “Revue,” Lehrer wrote almost 20 songs about what seemed to be irredeemably mundane topics (physics, math, and chemistry), setting many of those songs to show tunes and popular melodies. Take a stanza from “There’s a Delta For Every Epsilon”: “If an epsilon is a hero / Just because it is greater than zero / It must be mighty discouragin’ / To lie to the left of the origin.”Lehrer and the “Tom Lehrer Quartet” (which featured Robinson and Branscomb) then performed the “Revue” for Branscomb’s class. According to Branscomb, the show was a smash with both the students and the faculty at whom the show poked good-natured fun. “There was loud enough laughter and applause that the faculty in the building could hear it.... They insisted that we re-perform ‘The Physical Revue’ the next day,” Branscomb says.Following a later performance of the “Revue” in front of an audience of 500 at Allston Burr Hall, The Crimson published an enthusiastic review, deeming Lehrer “the most original funnyman in this—or almost any other—vicinity.” The success of the “Revue” encouraged Lehrer to start writing more original material, which would become the basis for his first studio album.HOUSEHOLD FAME That resulting album, “Songs By Tom Lehrer,” featured early examples of Lehrer’s satire, including “I Wanna Go Back To Dixie” (“I wanna talk with southern gentlemen / And put my white sheet on again / I ain’t seen one good lynchin’ in years”), and his morbid humor, as on “I Hold Your Hand In Mine” (hint: the hand isn’t attached to her arm). Lehrer personally bought 400 copies, hoping to sell 250 to friends, family, and classmates in order to break even. The 24-minute album sold 10,000 copies in its first year and would go on to sell 370,000 copies in the 1950s alone.Jeffrey B. Morris, an archivist for the radio program “The Dr. Demento Show” who has interviewed Lehrer multiple times as research for an informal biography, says that the record’s success is all the more impressive given Lehrer’s nonexistent advertising and constrained distribution. “He was not signed to a major record label…he wasn’t on any major TV and didn’t get any major airplay in the ’50s. It was all basically word-of-mouth—to sell 370,000 records that way is just astounding,” Morris says.Even as “Songs By Tom Lehrer” was beginning to sell steadily, Robinson and Branscomb both say that at the time, Lehrer still had no desire to embark on a long-term, professional musical career. “The music and the performance were a sideline,” Robinson says. Branscomb agrees, emphasizing that Lehrer was mostly in it for the fun of the thing. “Tom never particularly wanted to be a celebrity.”FREEDOM OF CHOICE

Undergraduate Council representatives discussed the launch of a <a href=""http://uc.fas.harvard.edu/"">new UC website and an initiative to increase funding for UC-sponsored study breaks during the group’s first general meeting of the spring semester Monday night. The meeting was the first led by new UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14.The website, which is still in its beta version and went live at 1 a.m. Monday morning, is designed to be more user-friendly than the blog-like format of the organization’s previous website.“I think this is something that is going to be a really big step for the UC if we have an intuitive website that’s really easy to use and really accessible,” Raghuveer said.Though members were generally enthusiastic about the new website, some going so far as to describe it as “beautiful” and “sleek,” others voiced concerns about its technical aspects.During the meeting the UC also debated legislation about study break funding, ultimately deciding to table the issue until after spring recess.
The legislation, entitled the “Study Break Funding Act,” would have increased funding for UC-sponsored study breaks from $50 to $80 for each House per semester.Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the act’s sponsor, argued that $50 is not enough money to purchase the food necessary to hold an effective study break, especially given the increasing price of food.Goffard reasoned that increasing the budget for UC study breaks would increase their frequency, which in turn would bolster the visibility of the organization on campus. Only two UC study breaks were held last semester,“Especially during exam week and especially when the workload starts increasing, even just one study break makes a big difference,” Goffard said.Although members seemed generally supportive of the initiative, the members voted to postpone a vote on the act until they have more information on whether there is room in the group’s operations budget for the spending increase. The motion to table the legislation passed 13-10.In an interview with The Crimson after the meeting, Goffard said he was disappointed with the tabling of the legislation and the lack of emphasis on study breaks on campus. He said that even though study breaks are budgeted for, many UC members tend to hold very few of them.“I didn’t think it would be so controversial because it was just $500,” Goffard said, “I really wanted to encourage people to do these study breaks and to reach out, and the fact that we only had two last semester was a little disappointing.”Raghuveer said that she thought that overall the UC’s first meeting represented a succesful start to the semester.“I think [the meeting] went really well and honestly it doesn’t feel like this was my first UC meeting because the [representatives] were active over winter break,” Raghuveer said in an interview following the event. “It doesn’t feel like anyone is unprepared to get started on a really productive semester.”—Staff writer Steven S.

Friday in Sanders Theatre, the Venice Baroque Orchestra will attempt to recreate one of the exemplary epochs in classical music and to transport its audience to the golden age of 17th- and 18th- century classical Italian Baroque music.Established in 1997 by Baroque conductor, musician and scholar Andrea Marcon, the Venice Baroque Orchestra has garnered international acclaim after several world tours to destinations in England, France, Japan, Greece, Germany, and, recently, New York. The musicians have collaborated in the past with the likes of composer Philip Glass, Italian violinist Giuliano Carmignola and mezzo-soprano singer Romina Basso. On Friday, the period instrument ensemble’s concert will feature a solo performance of a Baroque Italian concerto, played by Marcon on the harpsichord. The performance will also include pieces written by famed Baroque musician composer Antonio Vivaldi, a native of Venice. Brian R. Stuart, marketing and publicity director of the Boston Early Music Festival, says, “[What distinguishes the Orchestra is] its close interaction and interplay between the full orchestra and the soloists themselves.” The orchestra prides itself on using techniques and instruments authentic to the Italian Baroque. “We’re bringing some of the greatest artists in the world that perform some of this classical music better than anyone else,” Stuart says. “It’ll be a unique opportunity for the Boston community to hear this music from the best ensemble in the world, who are really unparalleled in terms of performance.”  Almost 4,000 miles away from Venice and over 300 hundred years after its composition, the VBO will give the music of the Italian Baroque era new life.

Don’t start putting together your survival kits just yet—everything  you know about zombies is about to change. In “Warm Bodies,” directed  by Jonathan Levine and based off the book of the same title by Isaac  Marion, zombies—which have already evolved dramatically since they first  entered pop culture in the early 20th century—take a new and touching  turn. While suggesting a whole host of new considerations in planning  for zombie apocalypse survival, Levine’s heart-warming film drastically  and hilariously reinterprets what it means to be a zombie and advances  the genre in an unconventional direction.Unlike most films of the subgenre, in which zombie characters  aren’t much more than stock monsters and tragedies; in “Warm Bodies,”  they are the most compelling and well-acted figures in the film.  Essential to this is the film’s unapologetic departure from the  traditional definition of zombies as brain-dead, which allows for the  entertainingly angsty inner monologue of R (Nicholas Hoult). R’s best  friend Marcus (Rob Corddry) is superb comic relief as well. They are  part of a multitude of zombies who may or may not also have active minds  themselves, perhaps frustrated like R by their inability to express  themselves or even move easily.These zombies hunt humans for food, but they are still not the  greatest threat to the surviving community of humans. Worse than  regular, slow moving zombies are so-called “bonies,”—a sort of skeletal  super-zombie, larger and more dangerously agile than the standard type.  These extra-zombified zombies provide a further twist to the traditional  zombie narrative by pushing the regular zombies closer to humans and  eventually giving zombies and humans a common enemy. The plot follows  the “Romeo and Juliet”-based love story between R and the human girl  Julie (Teresa Palmer), whose father (John Malkovich) is the leader of  the remaining survivors. By another quirk of this strain of zombie-ness,  R falls in love with Julie and takes her to the airport where he and  the other zombies live. A long and somewhat predictable process ensues,  in which R tries first to win her over and then to impress upon her  society the idea that zombies are people too. Palmer plays her role as  straight woman well, but it is Hoult and the hilariously well-integrated  soundtrack that keep the film engaging and fresh—throughout “Warm  Bodies,” Hoult showcases his ability to be goofy and expressive despite  his limited range of movement, and the music both complements and  injects additional humor into the story with choices such as Bruce  Springsteen’s “Hungry Heart.”It’s worth noting that “Warm Bodies” is not “Twilight” with  zombies. While it is a romance between a human girl and a  not-exactly-human guy, the irreverence with which “Warm Bodies” treats  the entire subject matter sets it entirely apart. Different too is how the liberties taken with zombie psychology and  physiology not only give the plot more flexibility, but suggest that  zombies have a strong metaphorical significance within this film. In  many horror movies, zombies either serve as little more than plot  devices or have symbolic meaning that is difficult to detect. In “Warm  Bodies,” the terror of R’s nearly locked-in experience and his inability  to communicate, though masked with levity, could be seen as reminiscent  of the increasing complexity of communication and expression in modern  society. The tension he feels while trying desperately to speak like a  normal human, is reminiscent of the general feelings of nervousness and  social awkwardness that so many people feel at some point. More  generally, though, his grunt-like conversations with Marcus, their  completely incomprehensible attempts to get through to each other, as  well as R’s use of music to communicate his good intentions when he  first meets Julie, seem to echo the confusion and limitation imposed on  communication today by the array of technologies which so often confound  interpersonal contact.Thematics aside, “Warm Bodies” is extraordinarily sweet and  energetic. The new perspective on zombies it presents is at once  outlandish and also quite intriguing. It is fitting that as we progress  scientifically and culturally, our conception of zombies within film  should evolve and we should strive to understand them better. Perhaps  “Warm Bodies” ought to teach us to consider building loving  relationships with zombies as a viable plan for zombie apocalypse  survival, or perhaps it is a movie about acceptance and learning to  communicate comfortably with others. Likely, it is just the latter.

UPDATED: February 6, 2013, at 5:36 a.m.Massachusetts State Representative Daniel B. Winslow announced Tuesday that he will form an exploratory committee to help him consider a run for the Senate seat vacated last week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry. Winslow, who has represented Norfolk since 2011, would be the first major Republican to enter the special election and is the first to form an exploratory committee.“We need to fix a broken Washington where progress is being hampered by partisan gridlock,” Winslow said in a press release Tuesday morning. “If we continue to elect the same Washington politicians, we can not expect different results.”Though the forming of an exploratory committee does not necessarily represent a decision to run, Winslow may be pressured to make a quick decision. Massachusetts law requires that any candidate who wishes to enter a party primary for a U.S. Senate seat must collect 10,000 valid signatures from registered party members.The signatures must be presented for verification by February 27.
“Getting 10,000 signatures, that might not sound so hard, but it can be an uphill battle,” said former Republican congressional candidate Joseph A. Selvaggi.Selvaggi estimated that a candidate would have to collect over 15,000 signatures to ensure that he had 10,000 eligible names.“That’s no easy task,” Selvaggi concluded.As of Tuesday evening, no other major Republicans had launched a campaign, but Douglas Bennett, a two-time Boston city council candidate, had announced that he would run.Gabriel E. Gomez, a venture capitalist and former Navy Seal, expressed a strong interest in running last week, and sources <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/5/winslow-senate-run-announcement/"">told The Crimson Monday that a Gomez-Winslow primary was a strong possibility.The new entrants to the Republican primary come after a host of other influential Massachusetts Republicans—including former U.S. Senator Scott P. Brown, former Governor William F. Weld ’66, and former gubernatorial hopeful Charles D. Baker ’79—turned down the opportunity to run.Primaries for both parties will be held on April 30. The winner of the Republican primary will likely be an underdog to the Democratic nominee. Congressman Edward J. Markey of Malden is currently favored in his primary against Congressman Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston.—Staff writer Matthew Q. Clarida can be reached at clarida@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/MattClarida"">@MattClarida.

In what indicates his possible interest in entering the special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Massachusetts State Representative Daniel B. Winslow has announced that he will issue a press release “regarding his plans for the U.S. Senate special election” and hold a press conference Tuesday.Before the press release was announced, Republican sources told The Crimson that Winslow, a Republican from Norfolk and a former advisor to then-Governor Mitt Romney, would likely enter the race.Winslow said Friday that he would take the weekend to make a decision about running.Winslow announced his upcoming press release in a post on Twitter Monday, writing “Can we fix America and break the gridlock?” He also included in his tweet the hashtag “#masen.”As of Monday no other Republicans have announced their candidacy for the race. Former U.S. Navy Seal Gabriel E. Gomez, who has been identified by multiple sources as a potential candidate, has indicated a possible interest in entering.
Former Mass. Senator Scott P. Brown, former Governor William F. Weld ’66, and other Republicans well-known in the state have said they will not run.Winslow, a former district court judge, left the bench in 2002 to advise Romney and, more recently, Brown. Winslow has served as Norfolk’s representative in the Massachusetts House of Representative since 2011.Though Winslow may not have the statewide name recognition of some, politically-connected Republicans told The Crimson Monday that they were optimistic about his chances.“Dan Winslow is a leader that I would be excited about,” said former Republican congressional candidate Joseph A. Selvaggi. “He is smart, honest, and tells it like it is. I think people admire him as a principled person.”Todd Domke, a Republican media analyst, called Winslow “formidable, successful, and articulate.”Both the Democratic and Republican primaries will be held on April 30. The winner of the Republican primary will likely face either Representative Stephen F. Lynch or Representative Edward J. Markey, who is currently leads in Democratic primary polls.Domke, who was also complimentary of Gomez, said that a Winslow-Gomez primary could be beneficial to the Massachusetts Republican party, presenting an opportunity for the party to remake its image after Brown, Romney, and numerous other Republicans nation-wide lost their races during the 2012 elections.“If the party is going to rebuild and revive itself then this primary contest could be the beginning,” said Domke.—Staff writer Matthew Q.

Going into the 35th Annual Beanpot Tournament, the No. 5 Harvard women’s hockey team (17-2-2, 14-1-1 ECAC) will be playing with a bit of a chip on its shoulder.“Our attitude is that we have something to prove,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “Especially after last year.”It was a tough go-around for the Crimson in the 2012 tournament. Harvard dropped a 5-2 decision to Boston University in the first round. The Crimson then went on to suffer a 4-2 loss at the hands of Boston College in the consolation game.“Last season, we struggled with beating teams outside of our conference that were ranked,” Fry said.This year will be a fresh start for Harvard, who looks to avenge its poor showing last year and return to its winning ways.
The Crimson last captured the cross-town tournament title in 2010, edging out Northeastern with a 1-0 victory in the finals. Harvard has won the Beanpot a grand total of 13 times, second only to Northeastern’s 15 titles.But success in this year’s Beanpot will not come easy. First up on the schedule for the Crimson is a Tuesday night contest against the No. 2 Eagles (20-4-2, 13-2-1 Hockey East).“This game against BC is huge,” Fry said. “Of the Boston teams, they’re probably our biggest rival. It’s going to be a fun game.”The Eagles enter the Beanpot fresh off a 6-3 road win against Maine, capping a three-game win streak. Boston College got off to a rough start to its 2012-13 campaign, dropping three of its first four games of the season. Since then, the Eagles have found its form. The team’s only loss since October is a 3-2 defeat at Mercyhurst two weeks ago.For Harvard, it will be an important game against a familiar opponent.“We always know they have a solid team,” Fry said. “We know most of the players, just from being a part of national camps and what not. They have a lot of talent. But I don’t think there is anything there that we can’t be ready for and we can’t be ready to compete with. It’s going to be a battle. I think it’s really going to be about who decides to show up that day.”The Crimson has had a season full of successes so far, but the team has hit a few roadblocks in recent weeks. Riding a seven game win streak, Harvard suffered its first loss since November at the hands of Clarkson on Jan. 25. The team bounced back with a 3-2 win over St. Lawrence the next day. The Crimson enters the Beanpot tournament fresh off a 2-2 overtime tie against Dartmouth“Obviously we were bummed to get the tie, but we weren’t disappointed in our performance necessarily,” Fry said. “I think after the [Dartmouth] game, the team is heading in the right direction. That was the first time in a while we’ve played true Harvard hockey. This is a good a time as any to get back on that track.”It will be a taxing few weeks for the Crimson, though, as the team works to balance its critical ECAC weekend contests while also fitting in Tuesday night Beanpot games.“It’s tough in February, when you’re playing a lot of games, and it is going to be about which team is in the best shape and has fresh legs,” co-captain Laura Bellamy said.Harvard scheduled some Tuesday night contests earlier in the season against non-conference opponents to prepare for the Beanpot tournament.“It always takes a physical toll, but we personally take it upon ourselves to do what we need to do to recover,” Fry said. “It’s good to have had some Tuesday night games already this season. Now, with school starting, we are realizing that we have all these other distractions, but when we get to the rink, it’s game time, whether it’s a Tuesday night, Friday night, or Saturday night.”A strong showing over the next two weeks would add to the Crimson’s already impressive season. The tournament will also give Harvard a chance to compete against top-tier opponents before post-season play. BC and BU are both ranked in the top three teams in the country, while Northeastern sits just outside the top 10. The cross-town showdown promises to feature some of this season’s national title contenders.“When the Beanpot comes around, it’s so much about pride that a lot of the toll that the season is taking is less noticeable,” Bellamy said. “You’re playing with so much pride.”—Staff writer Brenna Nelsen can be reached at brennanelsen@college.harvard.edu.

  What is a writer, and why should anyone write? Novelist and essayist Zadie Smith addressed these questions at a lecture on January 24 at the Museum of Fine Arts. In front of a packed lecture hall, Smith discussed the complicated figure of the “creative writer”—viewed in academia, she joked, as a harmless idiot savant, and yet also romanticized with a certain kind of awe.Smith had come to speak as part of the MFA’s annual Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Celebrity Lecture series, the lineup of which this season boasts such well-known guest lecturers as the mother-daughter pair of artist Laurie Simmons and filmmaker and HBO series “Girls” creator Lena Dunham, as well as acclaimed painter Kehinde Wiley.Smith, who prides herself on defying convention, is known for wearing turbans; true to form, she was sporting a pink one at the event. Even the style of her presentation defied trends; rather than follow what Smith termed the fashion in literary lectures of giving off-the-cuff ruminations, Smith gave a more traditional talk. “Writing is the attempt to own an identity,” she said. “[Its main pleasure is] the secret of transformation [and] of living many lives in one. You can be all the parts of you [that] you can’t express in normative existence,” she said. Her description seemed hardly surprising given the preoccupations of her work. Beginning with her celebrated debut novel “White Teeth,” which concerns the immigrant experience of mediating one’s heritage with one’s new culture, Smith has attempted nuanced explorations of what it is to own an identity and to navigate the influence of histories over which one may have little control.
Smith was open about admitting that she does not have all the answers. When facing a blank page, she said, it is alright to admit,“I am feeling a bit pointless and absurd.” The task of a writer is difficult and largely unglamorous, she said. In a society increasingly defined by its capacity to consume, Smith says, writing has the appeal of freedom because it is a form of self-expression not tied to a credit card.She was also honest about the difficulty of writing. “Despite the cacophony of careless writing we read every day, [one should write] without romantic self-pity or stylized despair,” Smith said. She advised aspiring writers to follow a mantra: “I am writing to make this sentence as good as possible.” When asked by an attendee how to convey to young students the importance of reading widely, she responded that reading keeps the aspiring writer from mistakenly believing his or her work to be completely new. These comments were reminiscent of advice Smith has given before. In 2010, British newspaper The Guardian asked noted writers for their “Ten Rules for Writing Fiction,” and Smith’s tenth piece of advice was, “Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never ­being satisfied.” Despite acknowledging that the process of writing can be thankless and arduous, Smith continues to be passionate about writing. In a 2013 interview with The Rumpus, an online literary magazine, Smith said, “You can’t write thoughtlessly[,]— that’s the problem with writing. You have to think about the damn thing all the time. I think that’s why it’s sometimes difficult. But rewarding, right? It’s rewarding.” Smith compared the writer at work on a story to a carpenter at work on a piece of furniture: No matter how well it is made, Smith says, “You have to accept that you are creating a surplus in demand and [may be] making a chair that nobody wants.”Writing may be challenging, but it is necessary, Smith suggests. For her it serves its purpose and allows her to investigate complex societal themes. We might not need writing if we could be all the different people we wanted to be all the time.

I am the whitest kid I know. From the pale skin, to the boat shoes, to the taste for pop rock and the inability to dance. Nine times out of 10 if there’s a white guy stereotype, I fit it.So when it comes to food, it should come as no surprise that I have the spice tolerance of a five-year-old. And I say that as an expression, since I’m sure there are five-year-olds out there who would spice me under the table (where I hide milk and yogurt for emergencies). In my mom’s culture, a cucumber sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise is the spiciest of meals, and she raised my sister and me with similar standards. Macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and spaghetti featured prominently in my childhood. The likes of Thai and Indian food never crossed my culinary path until far too late. I feared spice before ever giving it a chance.Last year, my figurative internal five-year-old figuratively grew up. It happened, as so many things do, over a blockmate lunch of red spice chicken. Considering the menu item, I had of course loaded my tray with the requisite bowl of blue cheese sauce and three glasses of milk. My friends, meanwhile, were dipping their pre-spiced chicken in other sauces—Frank’s Red Hot, Tobasco, Sriracha. They decided the chicken, which was already plenty red spiced by my standards, wasn’t quite hot enough, and were trying to determine which of the dhall’s other sauces worked best to bring the meal up to par. I couldn’t keep up.I decided then and there that I needed to transform my taste buds, to free myself from a life of pasta and rice. Gradually, under the careful guidance of my most pro-spice friends, I began to turn up the heat.Early training was tough. Frank’s Red Hot was deemed the least painful of the available sauces, and I began adding it to things that even I agreed were bland: macaroni and cheese, tuna fish sandwiches, french fries. I’d force myself to splash a few drops across the whole thing, mix it together until the drops couldn’t be identified (and avoided), and eat steadily, rewarding myself with milk only at the end of the plate. Though my mouth tingled for a while after each meal, I gradually developed a taste for Frank’s particular burn. The initial fiery bite brought the other flavors to life, I learned, and I found myself thinking about other things I actually wanted to add the red liquid to.
I used the same technique to introduce Tabasco and Sriracha to my palate. For any meal I thought wasn’t too spicy to begin with, I’d break out a little red bottle and, steeling myself for the now vaguely pleasurable agony ahead, splash a bit on my plate. I was making progress. My goal of being able to share spicy foods with real people was coming true faster than I could have dreamed.I got confident in my spices, adding cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to the kit at home, adding a bit of heat to my meat and pasta dishes whenever possible. My mom, from whom I inherited my weak spice tolerance, quickly learned not to eat anything I had made for myself. Grocery shopping became a battle of wills, as I leaned for the spicier options and she pulled for the safe varieties that now tasted bland to me. It was a constant debate: tomato and basil, or arrabbiata sauce?When I returned to school last semester, it was time to show off my newfound immunity to spicy foods. Ordering Chinese food for a late-night snack was no longer a game of accommodation, in which my friends made sure there were mild options for the pitiable Andrew. “I thought you didn’t like spicy food!” became my favorite words to hear, as I’d wolf down another bite of whatever red-tinged noodles we had ordered that night. I don’t mean to brag, but I even began asking for a couple squirts of the green sauce when visiting Felipe’s. Ladies, contain yourselves.Of course, I can’t keep up with my roommates—they’ve been raised on spice their whole lives. I’ve improved, yes, but perhaps I haven’t been completely inoculated? I still can’t dip my Red Spice Chicken in Sriracha like they can without crying myself to sleep later that night. What’s important, however, is that I no longer need to smother each bite with blue cheese or require the aid of milk.Now if only I could get my mom to try some pepper flakes.

There is something both timeless and eerily beautiful about arches in Safavid architecture. The elegant ogees appear in both two and three dimensions across the city of Esfahan, forming façades and domes, lining bazaars, and crisscrossing the Zayandeh Rud in the form of four stone pedestrian bridges.Stepping onto a pedestrian bridge is always a thrill. I still remember when I first walked across the Weeks Bridge, looking at the cars on both Soldiers Field Road and Memorial Drive and thinking to myself, “I bet you wish you could use this bridge.” Where else in Boston can you see people dancing Argentine tango beneath the full moon in the spring, jumping into the river in the summer, cheering on the rowers in the fall, and quickly running across in a bundle of down in the winter?In Esfahan, the bridges are in neither the town square nor the city center. In fact, the most famous of them was merely built as a shortcut to an Armenian suburb. Nevertheless, they remain one of the city’s primary tourist draws along with the equally arched and majestic Naqsh-e Jahan, one of the largest public squares in the world. People from all over, including my fellow travellers and myself, snap photos of the bridge during the day, exploring the ins and outs of all of the arches through the low-ceilinged passageways. But this is no Ponte Vecchio; the only businesses to be found on the bridges are a few traditional tea houses built into the stonework underneath with windows gazing out across the riverbed.Not that the bridge needs any other businesses, as tea somehow goes perfectly with Safavid arches. In the afternoons, people sit in traditional gardens, sipping the toffee-colored liquid out of pear-shaped clear glasses. These gardens are lush with flowers, orange persimmons, and bright magenta pomegranates hanging from the trees. The fountains, pools, and channels create a soft white noise, and the welcoming comments and invitations into people’s homes for dinner come from all directions. Some streets even have a Persian garden in the median. Despite the cacophony of traffic and motorbikes, walking down the middle of Four Gardens Boulevard is oddly calming. It was a far cry from what I had seen in “Argo” 72 hours before landing in Iran.Esfahan sleeps earlier than Tehran, except for the square and the bridge. In fact, my first encounter with the most famous, the Si-o-seh Pol, which literally means the Bridge of 33 Arches, came at midnight under the harvest moon.
It started as an evening stroll with my travel companions suffering from cabin fever after the five-hour bus ride that took us from Tehran to Esfahan. With a cool but balmy desert wind, we approached the sodium-vapor orange glow of the bridge. I was torn between wanting to take as many pictures as I could and a desire to put the camera away and simply watch the lives moving past me on quiet strolls, walks home, and the occasional romantic rendezvous at one of the few places where the young people of Esfahan feel comfortable as themselves.The world that I found at the bridge, and indeed in all the places I visited in Iran, is not the world often depicted in the American media. Rather, it is a space where people come together to do what we might do on a balmy summer’s night in the chairs of Harvard Yard: be ourselves with the people who matter most to us.We had seen pictures of the bridge in the spring, when nearly the entire city comes to the banks of the river to picnic and see friends during the New Year’s celebration in March. In those shots, the water reflected the glow of the lights like something out of a fairy tale, illuminating the entire length of the bridge. As we walked to the riverbank in person, though, all we could see was the dusty expanse of rocks where there should have been water. Nowadays, the river runs dry for most of the year, and several of the arches remain unlit, their lights long since burnt out.Some say the bridge is decaying. It is built of stone after all. Some say that the less and less that the Zayandeh Rud runs, the sooner the bridges will all collapse into the riverbed, another loss of Iranian grandeur far too soon after the destruction of the historic sites of Bam in an earthquake in 2004. I like to think, though, that this dark period in the bridge’s life might be more temporary. After all, stone has proven to be a most durable building material; the fully intact ancient fortresses of Iran across the region stand as testament to the material’s longevity, as do many of Rome’s finest treasures.We made our way quietly down to the base of the bridge and walked underneath to listen to the echo our voices made in the concave ceiling. In the nooks of the outward-facing arches we saw people relishing the beauty of the full moon and thinking about everything that surrounded them.Then, we heard the sound of music coming from further down the bridge. We walked out from underneath the arches and followed the melody to find three young Esfahani men who were strumming a guitar and singing quietly to themselves the elegant lilt of Persian rhymes. The melody was of a minor key, and the words, my colleague told me, were about love and loss. The men were eager to include us, and one by one, the Iranians around us joined in the song, each knowing the lyrics by heart.We all went to bed shortly thereafter. But I still hear that music every so often, though the musicians are far away. It makes me crave tea with bergamot.—Mark R.

Hasty Pudding Theatricals has finally picked a Man of the Year for 2013, and it's the guy who played Jack Bauer on Fox's ""24"" (also known to some diehard, know-it-all fans as Kiefer Sutherland).Once you've learned how to spell his name (we at Flyby recommend that you do this ahead of time so you can immediately tweet any spottings on Friday. Luckily the ""i"" before ""e"" rule holds true here), you may want to know a few more things about the enigmatic Canadian star.Herewith, four things you didn't know about Sutherland, the male recipient of the Hasty Pudding's highest annual honor:<!--more-->1. In 1991, he <a href=""http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20115436,00.html"">almost married Julia Roberts. Roberts, incidentally, was the recipient of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/2/14/a-pretty-woman-of-the-year/"">1997 Woman of the Year Award. The greatest power couple never to walk down the aisle? Probably not. A fun coincidence? Definitely.
2. He starred in character as Bauer in a series of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-VOoLmJncQ"">Japanese <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;v=Mg09rZBiJXc"">commercials for the nutritional supplement CalorieMate. As these commercials make clear, he does not speak Japanese.3. He's an honest <a href=""https://twitter.com/RealKiefer"">tweeter, even if that makes for lackluster tweets. Last February, he tweeted, ""Don't have anything clever to say (not that I ever have) but having a great day &amp; hope you are too!"" So heartfelt and real!4. He's no stranger to The Crimson. According to a Crimson <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/4/12/the-wild-directed-by-steve-spaz/"">review of the 2006 film ""The Wild,"" an animated Disney film in which Sutherland voiced the part of Samson (protaganist and lion), ""It could be said that Kiefer Sutherland is the next Sean Connery, albeit of a lesser talent than the legendary Scot.""Two years later, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/2/20/15-things-celebs-should-give-up/"">FM urged him to give up alcohol for lent.Welcome back, old friend.

Last week, as Harvard students perused courses and finalized schedules, the University was left aghast at the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/1/popular-classes-forced-lottery/"">extreme inaccuracy of its Pre-Term Planning data. Because of the unanticipated turnout for many classes, lecture halls were cramped and course lotteries were ubiquitous, leaving scores of students disappointed. Pre-Term Planning doesn’t work because Harvard students do not take it seriously, and for good reason: The goals of PTP are at odds with those of shopping week. In order to make shopping period a better experience for everyone, PTP will have to see some serious reforms.The aim of such reforms would be to make Pre-Term Planning a more thoughtful process, such that data would more closely mirror actual turnout. As it stands, students clearly do not put much thought into the whole affair—otherwise, we would not see hundreds of students forced to lottery for overfilled classes.One possible solution might be to require all students to meet with their academic advisors before submitting their PTP. This way, students would be less likely to pick classes at random or to choose classes that they will ultimately be unable to take because of their academic plan or schedule.For similar reasons, the University might consider asking students to partake in Pre-Term Planning later in the semester, or even better, between semesters. Pre-Term Planning for the spring takes place in the middle of the fall semester, when spring course enrollment is among the least of students’ many competing priorities. Resultantly, students are not likely to have thought much about the next semester’s classes when Pre-Term Planning time rolls around and are likely to approach Pre-Term Planning with haste and annoyance. If the University were to ask students to complete Pre-Term Planning between semesters, they would certainly be more likely to put time and effort into the process.Finally, to make Pre-Term Planning more useful, the College might consider asking students to indicate six or seven classes that they intend to shop rather than four courses that they intend to take. Harvard College students are lucky and grateful to have a shopping week, and Pre-Term Planning should better reflect the ethos of that week. If students were allowed to indicate more than four courses in their Pre-Term Planning, the data would strike a closer resemblance to how shopping week actually works—many students shop a number of courses, only finalizing their schedules after the week is over. It is not uncommon for students to select schedules that are very unlike those they had anticipated at the semester’s outset. Changing the system to reflect this tendency would improve the data by allowing for the flexibility and uncertainty inherent in shopping week.
Taken together, these reforms could do quite a bit to transform Pre-Term Planning from a dysfunctional mess into a useful and accurate tool. It is a great privilege to preview any of Harvard’s thousands of courses at the beginning of each term, and a reformed PTP system would help students make course selections in line with the spirit of shopping period. By injecting a bit of thoughtfulness, timeliness, and flexibility into the process, Harvard could avoid much of the chaos that characterized this semester’s shopping week.

Four years after his Panglossian crusade for hope and change was slugged by the realities of a dysfunctional Washington, President Obama emerged reinvigorated from an arduous campaign and delivered a second inaugural address that boldly staked a progressive agenda for his second term. But despite his recent posturing, the disquieting evolution of President Obama’s puzzling political identity troubles me.At the outset of his first term, an overcautious Obama squandered considerable political capital on tepid stimulus and healthcare bills due to a baffling inability to command the bully pulpit.  Mired in the minefields of increasingly radicalized Republican obstinacy, the administration’s myriad concessions and omissions rightly disheartened the president’s supporters.To the glee of many of his supporters, the president delivered a full-throated defense of the social safety net, declaring that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security “do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.”Jabbing at climate change deniers, Obama <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-21/politics/36473487_1_president-obama-vice-president-biden-free-market"">asserted, “some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.”The first president to ever use the word gay in an inaugural address, Obama most poignantly underscored the motif of equal rights for all people by grouping Seneca Falls and Selma with Stonewall, succinctly linking the women’s rights, civil rights, and gay rights movements.
The recent inaugural address revealed a bolder, more bellicose president who, no longer fearful of re-election, eschewed the traditional highfalutin, hollow rhetoric of inaugural addresses for an unapologetic liberal agenda. It was an eloquent rethinking of the American Dream through the progressive collective action embodied in the address’s refrain: “We the people.”And the speech contained many points that Republicans ought to rally behind rather than impulsively dismiss as an unnatural return to liberalism, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/22/politics/pol-back-to-reality"">did. Obama channeled the quintessentially American ideal of self-reliance in articulating skepticism towards government as panacea, a call for tax code reform, and a warning to reduce the size of the deficit.Seeing that the House of Representatives remains under intransigent Republican control, it’s unlikely that the president’s emboldened rhetoric can affect actual change on the policy front. But Obama has begun his second term in the right tone: one that is a marked departure from the seemingly weak-willed tone of the first term’s negotiator.But while the administration is in the throes of renovation, I cannot help but feel uneasy about the president’s identity (and not in the nonsensical birtherist way). After four years of pessimism with the way the president has authorized the National Defense Authorization Act and drone strikes and expanded the police state, I must ask—who is Barack Obama?He’s certainly not the liberal messiah that the 2008 campaign hailed him as. There’s a striking cognitive dissonance between candidate Obama and his actions as president. This is evident when one looks at his administration’s continuation and bolstering of controversial Bush-era practices like <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/new-justice-department-documents-show-huge-increase"">warrantless wiretapping, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all"">kill lists that sanction the extrajudicial killings of American citizens abroad, increased reliance on drone strikes in Pakistan employing questionable tactics like <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/24/un-examine-uk-afghanistan-drone-strikes"">double taps (follow-up strikes that target first responders) and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/white-house-presses-for-drone-rule-book.html?pagewanted=all"">signature strikes (unidentified victims fitting a certain description are counted as combatants). All liberals should be vehemently opposed to these policies, perpetrated by a one-time constitutional law professor, which so flagrantly infringe the Bill of Rights. The chorus of opposition to President Bush has sadly fallen silent.One might try to prove him faithful to his campaign pledges by pointing to his first term “achievements.” But many of these were watered down to the point of irrelevance by a dysfunctional Congress, including the healthcare law, the rescue of the financial and auto sectors, and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Perhaps the question of Obama’s political identity is best answered by the man himself: ""The truth of the matter is that my policies are so mainstream that if I had set the same policies that I had back in the 1980s, I would be considered a moderate Republican,” the president <a href=""%2522The%2520truth%2520of%2520the%2520matter%2520is%2520that%2520my%2520policies%2520are%2520so%2520mainstream%2520that%2520if%2520I%2520had%2520set%2520the%2520same%2520policies%2520that%2520I%2520had%2520back%2520in%2520the%25201980s,%2520I%2520would%2520be%2520considered%2520a%2520moderate%2520Republican.%2522"">said in an interview. It’s certainly true when one recalls that Richard Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan increased the debt ceiling <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/26/barack-obama/obama-says-reagan-raised-debt-ceiling-18-times-geo/"">18 times, and the individual mandate central to the Affordable Care Act was an idea promoted by the <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/25/120625fa_fact_klein"">Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank.I worry about possible Democratic complacency as the Republican Party demagogues itself into obsolescence. Citizens should not embrace the false dichotomy of Democrat and Republican—the imprimatur of a self-identifying liberal president should not allow his controversial actions to go unchecked and unchallenged. The president and the establishment Democratic Party have drifted so far to the right that too many political debates are between center-right and far-right positions, leaving the center vulnerable.As Yeats cautioned, when “the center cannot hold, things fall apart.”Idrees Kahloon ’16 is a Crimson editorial writer in Weld Hall.

Whenever Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick ’78 gives a formal public address, the chances are good that he will mention Orchard Gardens School. Whether he is stumping for votes for President Obama, addressing the Democratic National Convention, or delivering the State of the Commonwealth address, Governor Patrick speaks with great pride and enthusiasm about the progress being made by the once-failing school he has chosen as his calling card.Governor Patrick has made his commitment to education known at every available opportunity, and he has argued passionately for the opportunity and growth that education provides, not just as an end within itself, but as a means to achieve economic growth, progress, and excellence. This is reflective of the governor’s wider message: Through targeted development in sectors that form the foundation of our economy like education and infrastructure, Massachusetts can amplify its economic growth and recovery and its ability to compete on a regional and national scale.It should be no surprise, then, that in his State of the Commonwealth address, delivered on January 16, and in his subsequent budget proposal, Governor Patrick <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/governor/pressoffice/speeches/0116-state-of-the-commonwealth.html"">argued for a new economic strategy centered on “education, innovation, and infrastructure.” In order to see this strategy to fruition, the governor’s budget proposal calls for a $1.5 billion <a href=""http://blogs.bostonmagazine.com/boston_daily/2013/01/16/return-taxachusetts/"">increase in funding for education and transportation as well as increased local aid for the coming fiscal year. That is where the controversy comes in: To pay for the budget increases, Governor Patrick has <a href=""http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/01/gov_deval_patrick_to_ask_for_t.html"">proposed increasing the income tax from 5.25 percent to 6.25 percent while simultaneously lowering the sales tax from 6.25 percent to 4 percent to <a href=""http://blogs.bostonmagazine.com/boston_daily/2013/01/16/return-taxachusetts/"">generate around $1 billion in net revenue.To many Massachusetts residents who know the Commonwealth by the less-than-savory moniker “Taxachussetts,” the income tax increase is an unwelcome imposition. Critics of the plan argue that the tax hike adversely affects workers and families in a barely recovering economy. However, the merits of the plan are plain, as the proposed spending increases are designed to boost economic growth, equalize the tax burden, and elevate quality of living for the state overall. The plan’s benefits and the strategies it employs would mitigate the ill-effects of the income tax hike and would provide much needed improvements to the state now and in the future.The most obvious benefit of the governor’s plan is the direct impact it has on education, transportation, and local aid. The budget proposal <a href=""http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/01/gov_deval_patricks_proposed_ta.html"">includes a $226 million increase in general education aid as well as a $112 million increase in state scholarships. This education funding is vital to preserving and advancing the progress made by Massachusetts K-12 schools and to making college more accessible to students regardless of their socioeconomic background. Not only is this beneficial to low-income students and schools across the state, but the funding increase also fosters future economic growth, first by better equipping students to work in a competitive, high-level economy, and second, by sending more students to local universities and increasing the likelihood that workers with a higher degree will stay in state.
The transportation component of the governor’s plan is similarly impactful. Under Governor Patrick’s plan, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority will <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/01/22/mbta-run-late-night-weekend-service-under-patrick-transportation-proposal/gQLuQOuwM7dWVGTvaDyA9J/story.html"">extend services to 2 a.m. The plan also calls for passenger rail service to Springfield and the Berkshires, with an extension of commuter rail services to New Bedford and Fall River, a much-needed addition that connects the state and makes the system more accessible to a greater number of Massachusetts residents. Additionally, unrestricted aid to local cities and towns would increase by $40 million and could promote local growth, help still-recovering communities, and support infrastructure improvements, all vital to elevating the state’s overall growth and national standing.Critics acknowledge that the benefits of Governor Patrick’s plan are appealing, but dispute that they are worthy of an income tax increase that could potentially harm families still recovering from the economic downturn. These claims are less than strong given the design of the governor’s tax plan, which aims to <a href=""http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/01/23/governor-deval-patrick-proposes-billion-state-budget-includes-new-tax-hikes-candy-soda-and-cigarettes/MMEHfcfZD9iOghMRIed61N/story.html"">reduce the ill-effects of a tax increase by simplifying and equalizing the tax code so it better reflects ability to pay. In addition to cutting the sales tax, which is naturally regressive, the plan reduces the costs its income tax hike will inflict on low-income earners by doubling the personal income tax exemption. It also eliminates some corporate tax breaks, plus 45 other income tax deductions. These measures would serve to make the tax code more equitable and reduce the burden on families who are unable to pay a higher share of taxes.Fundamentally, the governor’s plan is about equality—equality of access to basic services, equality of tax burdens, and ultimately, equality of opportunity for us and for the generations that follow. Given the limited burden of the tax increases and improvements to the tax code as well as the lasting impact of the governor’s proposed funding allocations, the budget offers legislators the opportunity to shape the Commonwealth’s economic future in the short-term as well as the long-term.In the midst of a still-new and uncertain recovery, it is natural to focus only on the present, and certainly the number one priority should be ensuring that we do not slip back into a recession or into intractable debt. But it is just as vital, if not more so, that we focus on our future.Riley K. Carney ’15 is a Government concentrator in Eliot House.

This school year Harvard College completed its six-year transition to the new Program in General Education. For all undergraduate students, the Gen Ed program requires completion of a course in each of eight categories: “Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding,” “Culture and Belief,” “Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning,” “Ethical Reasoning,” “Science of Living Systems,” “Science of the Physical Universe,” “Societies of the World,” and “United States in the World.” It also requires that one of these courses engage with the study of the past. The aim of the program is to expose students to a “broad range of topics and approaches” and to connect a student’s education to “life beyond college.” Effectively, General Education is what makes Harvard a liberal arts college.Unfortunately, the program is not succeeding in its goals. The predominant sign of this failure is the student attitude toward Gen Ed classes. Many empirical reasoning and science classes are regarded as intellectually insubstantial and are chosen solely for this reason. Humanities courses are likewise scouted for easy grading and little work. Across the board, Gen Eds are regarded as less important than concentration or elective classes. In many cases a culture develops of not doing readings and paying little attention in class. These lectures are the first to be skipped, often with couched pride after “still getting an A.” The general attitude is not of becoming educated, but simply of fulfilling requirements as efficiently as possible.This problem goes beyond the system or implementation of the Gen Ed ideal. It is fundamentally rooted in the conflicting missions of the student body and the College. While Gen Ed aims to provide a broad and liberal education, a consumerist reality means students have an eye on attaining ends. This is especially true at a school that only accepts extremely high-achieving applicants. Students take classes with their future in mind: getting into graduate school or medical school, acquiring useful skills, fostering a resume.If this student attitude is a modern phenomenon, it is a result of social change and transition. The importance of broad education is rooted in class traditions that once demanded students to develop a breadth of diverse knowledge. Today, the learning process is much more compartmentalized. Literature and music can be irrelevant in the life of a engineer. It is a trope that humanities majors pride themselves on their inability to perform basic science and math.This is not to say that General Education classes never succeed. Many faculty members, inspired by the opportunity to share knowledge with a broad range of students, offer phenomenal courses through the Gen Ed program. Many students find fascination and enlightenment in fields outside their concentration. Yet there is no faith in the system.  General Education <a href=""http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/about/learning/liberal_arts.html"">appeals to a “spirit of free inquiry undertaken without concern for topical relevance or vocational utility” and “an opportunity to learn and reflect in an environment free from most of the constraints on time and energy that operate in the rest of life.” These ideals are simply not present among the current student body.
Harvard College needs to reconsider and restructure its curriculum to provide education for a post-modern age. If it is to fulfill the needs of the students it accepts, the General Education requirement should be removed. The classes themselves should stay, but the compulsion to undertake the process of erudition for the sake of completing requirements fuels reluctance and apathy towards many Gen Ed classes. If the College wishes to effectively maintain a mandatory liberal arts curriculum it must find a way to recreate the incentive structure behind liberal arts classes by fostering an attitude toward education in line with General Education ideals. Both students and the College should be encouraged to think critically about the meaning and purpose of a so-called “general education” at Harvard.Benjamin M. Woo ’13 is a cognitive science and music concentrator in Adams House.

In just two periods of play, Harvard women’s ice hockey goaltender Emerence Maschmeyer had already set a new personal best. Through 30 minutes of play, the freshman had made 25 saves against No. 2 Boston College in the first round of the Beanpot on Tuesday. The No. 5 Crimson went on to lose the contest, 2-1, to the Eagles at Matthews Arena.Maschmeyer, who has played in 12 games this season, finished with 34 saves on the night and a save-percentage of .944. Her two misses came in the third period. With just under thirteen minutes left in the contest, Boston College forward Emily Field handed off the puck to freshman Dana Trivigno, who drilled in a goal from the left circle over Maschmeyer. Nine minutes later, junior forward Taylor Wasylk received a pass from defenseman Lexi Bender for a quick goal.The rookie had registered her previous high in saves, 22, at Clarkson, where the Crimson fell, 3-1.Maschmeyer’s tally of 34 exceeds co-captain Laura Bellamy’s season-high of 30, achieved twice this year, in wins at Quinnipiac on Oct. 26 and St. Lawrence on Jan. 26.“The team played really well in front of me,” Maschmeyer said. “I think as a whole, in the game in general, everyone played really well, just a couple of big breakdowns. When we need to get something done, we just have to get it done. We can’t hold back, we just have to go for it.”
POWER [PLAY] FAILUREHarvard received three power play opportunities and was unable to convert on each.“We had some good looks on our power play,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “The goaltender played very well in front of them. It’s very difficult to score a power play so you want to get good looks at the net. I thought we moved the puck well.”Harvard posts a power play percentage of 17.8 for the season, having scored 13 goals off 73 opportunities.The team received its first chance 11:18 into the first period off a penalty on Eagles co-captain Blake Bolden for checking. While the two-minute man-advantage saw the Crimson win four face-offs and take three shots, it was unable to yield a goal.A second window opened in the second stanza, when Boston College forward Meagan Mangene was sent to the box for checking. Eagles goaltender Corinne Boyles made four saves throughout the power play off shots from Harvard forwards junior Lyndsey Fry, co-captain Jillian Dempsey and sophomore Hillary Crowe, while additional shots from Fry and sophomore defenseman Sarah Edney went wide.The third power play proved to be just as futile as after Bolden was flagged for hooking, the Crimson failed to reach the back of net on six attempts.“It’s a great opportunity if you get a goal, but the good news is we were able to get one [goal] five on five,” Stone said. “Unfortunately, we did not stave off the pressure.”PARK AND RIDEFreshman forward Mary Parker scored her fourth goal of the season and the first of the game. She took three shots in the contest and found success nearly five minutes into the final frame.Parker fed a pass to junior forward Gina McDonald, who slammed the puck into the goal. Boyles deflected the shot but Parker was there for a second chance. McDonald and Crowe came through for the hand-off and Parker was able to evade Boyles for the goal at the 4:52 mark.Parker, whose older sister Elizabeth is a junior defenseman, also found the most success winning face-offs on the night. The forward won a team-high six face-offs, dropping only two.Overall, Harvard trailed Boston College in face-offs, winning 24 to the Eagles’ 30. Boston College forward Alex Carpenter was the overall leader in face-offs, capturing 16.“I think it was one of the best games [Parker] played tonight,” Stone said. “She played with a lot of grit and she had some jump in her step. She was good around the net and that’s how she got the goal on the second opportunity. She’s a good face-off player and so that was a big piece of it for us today. ”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

Twenty-eight was the number of the night as Harvard men’s volleyball team hitters junior Nick Madden and freshman Branden Clemens combined for that many kills in a victory over Rivier College, 3-1, at the Malkin Athletic Center on Tuesday. The Raiders (2-3) were held to 28 kills as a team.Rivier pushed the Crimson (5-2, 1-1 EIVA) to four sets, taking the second set, 18-25.Harvard has not had a three set sweep since blanking Saint Francis on Jan. 25, four games ago.“We had three weekends in a row that were away, so that was hard,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “We were a little tired, but we love playing at home. Hopefully we’ll get better each time.”Clemens and Madden led the team offensively, while in a true team effort junior Michael Owen went for nine kills and sophomore Caleb Zimmick added eight.
For the second straight game, Clemens registered 27 total attacks but tallied six more errors that his last attempt, with eight on the night.“It was really cool to play at home,” Clemens said. “It’s crazy that I’m here. I’m so excited to be starting and the team was really excited about it. It was a good feeling.”The first set opened with the teams answering each other’s scores until Harvard pulled away, 8-5, with a service error off Raiders’ middle hitter Aaron Alamario and attack errors from junior middle hitter Terence Matall as well as freshman outside hitter Chris Markuson.While Rivier climbed within two, the Crimson went on a 7-1 run to widen the lead, 18-10.Assisted by several more attack errors, Clemens, Zimmick, and Madden pitched in kills to close out the set in Harvard’s favor, 25-15.While the first set saw the Crimson hold a firm lead, the Raiders climbed atop in the second stanza. Three attack errors by Clemens and one by Owen allowed Rivier to lead Harvard, 8-3, early in the set.The Crimson never fell into sync, dropping the set, 25-18. Their hitting percentage was stifled to .069.“In the second, we weren’t passing well and we were hitting even worse,” Clemens said. “We kind of fell apart compared to what we were playing like in the first set. It was definitely just on our side of the court.”Although Harvard held itself to six errors in the first and third sets and five in the final frame, 11 errors crept up on the Crimson in the second set.The Raiders committed just one error in its victorious second stanza, yet creep up to 10 and then nine in successive frames.

In a game full of big plays and even bigger stops, the No. 5 Harvard women’s hockey team went up against No. 2 Boston College in the first round of the 35th Annual Beanpot Tournament.“Massive defensive zone breakdowns in the third period killed us,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Otherwise, it was a pretty good game. We did a lot of things really well.”The final of three third period goals proved to be the difference as Harvard fell at Northeastern’s Matthews Arena by a final score of 2-1.“When we needed to we didn’t take care of our own end,” Stone said. “It cost us big. You can’t afford that against good teams.”The decisive goal came off the stick of Taylor Wasylk, who was able to get behind the defense and knock it through freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer’s pads.
“I saw an opening and went to the net,” Wasylk said. “Lexi [Bender] made an awesome play and hit me. I didn’t even know it was coming. It just kind of hit my stick and went in.”Despite chances in the first two periods, the Crimson was unable to put one in the net.Co-captain Jillian Dempsey came close, though, at the end of both periods. With less than 60 seconds left in the first, Dempsey shot a high attempt at net that was put aside by Eagles goaltender Corrine Boyles.At the end of the second, a leading pass found a streaking Dempsey who, all alone, couldn’t slide it past Boyles. Boyles finished with 40 saves on the night.On the other end on the ice, Maschmeyer had a career high 34 saves of her own. Both goalies had shutouts going well into the third.Maschmeyer’s previous two games against ranked opponents, No. 2 Cornell and No. 9 Northeastern, ended in a pair of 3-1 victories.The first converted opportunity in Tuesday’s contest came when junior forward Gina McDonald collected a puck behind the goal and sent it along to freshman forward Mary Parker, who was able to collect her own rebound and send it barreling into the back of the net. The goal was Parker’s fourth of the season.Less than three minutes later, Boston College answered with some pretty passing of its own and put Dana Trivigno in the perfect position to slap the puck over Maschmeyer’s pads.The night concluded Harvard’s longest scoring drought of the year. Going back to the last two periods of Friday’s game against Dartmouth, the squad went four frames without punching one past an opposing goaltender.Despite amassing a combined nine shots, the Crimson failed to convert on three power play opportunities.

UPDATED: February 6, 2013, at 5:30 a.m.Residents of nine of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses can start voting at noon Wednesday to fill 13 open seats on the Harvard Undergraduate Council.The UC holds a special election at the beginning of every spring semester for members of the UC’s Executive Board, whose terms expire in December. This particular year, however, is notable for the high number of departures by representatives choosing to pursue internships or other extracurricular activities. Voters last February only had to choose seven new representatives.Two representatives from Quincy and one each from Mather and Kirkland chose to run for re-election after a term on the Executive Board.Residents of Dunster and Eliot Houses will vote for two new representatives, while voters in Adams, Cabot, and Winthrop House will elect a single new representative each. All of these positions were vacated by former representatives who resigned or declined to run for re-election.
Finally, last November’s election of Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Q. Zhu ’14 as president and vice president left positions open in Currier House and Quincy House.The special elections in Kirkland, Currier, Adams, and Cabot are uncontested.Despite having all three of their seats up for a vote, residents of Quincy were generally apathetic about the election, with many admitting they did not know there was going to be one. Residents of Winthrop House, which held a special election last November after two of its <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/5/uc-expels-members/"">representatives were expelled from the UC, were similarly in the dark about the election.“I feel like [the UC] doesn’t have a direct impact on my activities,” said Benjamin Lopez ’15, a resident of Winthrop House who said he did not know about the special election or the names of his current House representatives.Former Dunster representative Delara Z. Alameddine ’14 and Eliot representative Terah E. Lyons ’14, both of whom declined to give phone interviews, wrote in emails to The Crimson that they decided not to continue with the UC because they did not feel comfortable splitting their attention between the organization and their other commitments.“I thought it would be less than fair to my housemates and fellow volunteers to take on a position in the UC once again,” said Alameddine, who is the co-director of the Strong Women Strong Girls volunteer organization and was recently elected as Dunster House Committee co-chair.“I just simply didn’t have enough time to dedicate to the administrative duties of my position and wanted to give it to someone who would be able to dedicate the time and attention that it deserved this semester,” Lyons said. “I decided to step away from the UC because the break between semesters made for a more graceful, timely exit.”Voting closes at noon on Friday.—Staff writer Steven S.

UPDATED: February 6, 2013, at 5:26 a.m.The Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will relocate “in almost its entirety” to University-owned land in North Allston in as few as five years, University President Drew G. Faust told The Crimson Tuesday.The same announcement made later that day at the monthly Faculty Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences drew sharp criticism from SEAS professors concerned about upholding an engineering education integrated with the liberal arts.Construction on SEAS facilities in Allston is slated to begin in 2014 and should be completed near the end of 2017 or early 2018.The administration has long eyed Allston for an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/new-programs-reflect-emphasis-on-science/"">expansion of science facilities and Faust pointed to rapid growth in many areas of the sciences as an opportunity for corresponding physical expansion.
She said that SEAS—“a school that reaches out to other schools”—was also an ideal fit for Allston because of its collaborative nature. Moving across the river, she said, will facilitate connections between SEAS and other Harvard facilities, such as Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, and the I-Lab, a center in Allston dedicated to student entrepreneurship.“We think it can be a kind of generator, a hub, for spokes that will go out and reach to other key nodes of academic pursuit as they are established in Allston,” Faust said.But SEAS professors expressed concerns at Tuesday’s meeting that moving to Allston would sever other important ties in Cambridge.University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 first announced the move to the SEAS faculty last Tuesday, professors said at the meeting, and the information was unexpected. The “Allston bomb,” said Robert D. Howe, area dean for bioengineering, generated as much discussion “as if [Garber] had dropped a literal bomb.”Many SEAS faculty members hold joint appointments with FAS and were worried that moving across the river would compromise SEAS’s interdisciplinary endeavors.“I believe that should we be transported across the river, our model—our paradigm, really—cannot work,” said Steven C. Wofsy, area dean for environmental science and engineering.Area dean for computer science Michael D. Mitzenmacher identified this “paradigm” as “an engineering school embedded in a liberal arts education.” Transplanting SEAS to Allston, he said, might discourage professors committed to that core mission.“How can we maintain engineering being a part of the liberal arts education when we are going to be separated from the rest of the College?” he said.Faculty members met the announcement with a range of largely “unexcited to hostile” reactions, Mitzenmacher said.Garber said at the meeting that SEAS’s move represents only the first phase of long-term development in Allston.

For over a decade, aspiring physicians and public health scientists have been sitting in bricks-and-mortar classrooms to take a Harvard course called “Human Health and Global Environmental Change.”This semester, for the first time, students sitting in front of computer screens across the globe will have the chance to take the class free of charge.The new online version of the class, PH278x: “Human Health and Global Environmental Change,” will be offered this spring through edX, the online education platform launched by Harvard and MIT last May.PH278x is the second School of Public Health class to be offered through edX. Last fall, in the first semester of edX, PH207x: “Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research” boasted an enrollment of over 50,000 students.PH278x will be co-taught by Aaron S. Bernstein, pediatrics instructor at Harvard Medical School, and John D. Spengler, professor of environmental health and human habitation at the School of Public Health.
“The goal of the class is to help students understand that when we alter the planet’s climate or dramatically change the way life on the planet lives, those actions have direct effects on the ability of humans to lead healthy lives,” Bernstein said. “There is a tremendous knowledge gap around the world on these issues, and the opportunity to provide a free resource to people all over the world is immense.”PH278x has branched beyond the scope of Harvard’s campus before. In the past, course lectures have been recorded and distributed to hundreds of students in other medical school and public health universities. But Bernstein said the leap to virtual education will present new challenges, including the difficult task of assessing whether students are actually learning online.Bernstein said that PH278x, along with other non-quantitative courses offered through edX for the first time this semester, “will be real tests of pushing past what this platform is capable of.”The PH278x team has been discussing the idea of filming footage outside the classroom to be used in the course. For example, to complement his discussion of the globalized food industry, Bernstein said he might take a camera to the grocery store to document the components of a meal.“We’re thinking of the life cycle of each of those goods on a larger scale and what that means for sustainability for food consumption,” Bernstein said. “Using those real world experiences—something you wouldn’t be able to do in the classroom—can really bring those ideas home. EdX is a great vehicle to have that conversation with.”—Staff writer Cynthia W. Shih can be reached at cshih@college.harvard.edu.

When CB22x: “The Ancient Greek Hero” debuts as one of edX’s first humanities courses this spring, the class will face an entirely new set of challenges than those faced by its quantitative predecessors.CB22x, the online version of professor Gregory Nagy’s long-running course on ancient Greek heroes, will reach an anticipated audience of 40,000 when it starts this spring as part of edX, the online learning venture started by Harvard and MIT.“Because we are a humanities course, what we need is a kind of variation of the Socratic method,” Nagy said. “Dialogue is more important than getting X amount of information uploaded at any given moment.”Departing from the structure of his lecture course, Nagy will conduct dialogues with colleagues about the course’s assigned reading.To encourage a more interactive experience, a technological development to facilitate private and public commentary is being developed for the class, which, according to Nagy, is the College’s longest continuously running course.
“We’re building a massive annotation tool, which will allow students to comment on any portion of course material, including video, audio, images, and text,” said Jeff Emanuel, HarvardX fellow for the study of the humanities.Through the tool, students will be able to make private comments, which can be exported as course notes. They will also be able to respond to forum discussions.According to Emanuel, 14,000 students have already enrolled in CB22x and participation is expected to triple. To accommodate the high enrollment, the CB22x team has been working with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Registrar to recruit past teaching fellows and students to serve as mentors for a “Board of Readers.”Nagy said having mentors who have already taken the course and done the readings will greatly improve the experience of students who have not previously been exposed to the analysis of classic literature.“The more people you have there, the more individual interaction you can have. [Having that] is obviously a challenge in a massive, open online course,” Emanuel said.Although still in the development process, another technological tool will allow instructors to graphically see how the course is engaging participants at a macro level. Instructors will be able to see correlations between demographic characteristics and students’ analysis of the text, according to Claudia P. Filos, the course’s content editor.CB22x will focus on analyzing ancient Greek texts, including Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Additionally, students will have free access to the electronic version of Nagy’s new textbook, “The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours.”“It’s not for money. It’s a labor of love,” Nagy said.—Staff writer Amna H. Hashmi can be reached at amnahashmi@college.harvard.edu.

A group of student and faculty presenters from the Boston area advocated investing in the brainpower of the Greece’s citizens to improve the troubled country’s economic outlook at an event Tuesday evening.The Harvard College Hellenic Society and the MIT Hellenic Students’ Association sponsored the forum entitled “Repowering Greece: The Most Innovative Ways to Revamp Greece.” The symposium was co-sponsored by the RepowerGreece campaign, an international initiative to promote Greece.The eight speakers, selected from many students and faculty throughout Boston, shared their solutions to the situation in a TED Talk-like format. Ideas ranged from advising that Greece set up a social media platform to match supply and demand for day-to-day services to suggesting that Greece invest more in mobile technology to better capitalize on tourism, its main industry.“The real gold mine for Greece is in its people’s intellect,” said Nicholas Ashford, professor of technology and policy at MIT, who criticized Greece’s current operation to establish a gold mine in its northern regions. “We’re going in the wrong direction.”Harvard students Paul P. Stavropoulos ’13 and Maria N. Theophanous ’13 echoed the same sentiment by applying an economic model to demonstrate the importance of innovation to Greece’s economic growth.

“Innovation is the best way for Greece to have a long-term and sustainable growth process,” said Theophanous, before revealing that Greece is ranked 146 out of 150 countries in the world as the best place to start a business. The United States, on the other hand, is ranked 13.Ioannis Simaiakis, a McKinsey and Company management consultant with a Ph.D. from MIT, also compared the U.S. to Greece and proposed an explanation as to why the two differed greatly. Greece, he said, took a “shortcut” to the path of sustainability. According to Simaiakis, Greece had hoped to instill values by focusing its attention on its institutions and policies rather than creating values of its people.Citing Ashford’s previous statement on the importance of self-discovery in Greece, Simaiakis agreed that a social transformation was greatly needed to improve the country.—Staff writer Connie Yan can be reached at connieyan@college.harvard.edu.

Student activists and members of Harvard’s various unions gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall Tuesday to show their support for the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers during what have become the longest contract negotiations between the University and HUCTW in history.Tuesday’s showing was the fifth time over the past three weeks that workers have amassed in front of the building that houses senior administrators like University President Drew G. Faust. Union members have said they will continue to stand in front of Mass. Hall every Tuesday and Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. until the negotiations are resolved.HUCTW represents more than 4,600 members of Harvard’s non-faculty staff. The previous contract between the union and the University expired July 1 of last year.Although negotiations over a new contract began last spring, the two sides have yet to reach an agreement.The current negotiations are the longest in HUCTW’s history. The second longest began in 1992, when the contract between HUCTW and Harvard expired on June 30 of that year and a new agreement was not ratified until January 1993.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that he is optimistic about the potential impact of the demonstrations in front of Mass. Hall on current negotiations, and hopes they encourage the Harvard community to engage in the discussion.“When Harvard changes in one direction or another, it’s usually, more than anything, because there is a strong will of a broad-based community to go in a new direction,” he said.A University spokesperson wrote in an email that Harvard’s focus is currently on the ongoing contract negotiations.“We certainly recognize the union’s right to public protest, but our focus at the moment is on seeking a fair and constructive resolution through mediation, a process mutually agreed upon and announced with the union,” wrote the spokesperson.Salary increases have been the largest source of conflict in the negotiation. Some protesters have claimed that the proposed increases to their salaries do not meet the rising cost of living­—a claim disputed by the University.“We are confident that our wage proposals, which have consistently been well above local inflation, are both fair and competitive,” wrote the University spokesperson.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average inflation rate for all urban wage earners and clerical workers in Boston was 1.6 percent in 2012. In September, the University proposed a 2.8 percent increase to workers’ wages during the first year of a three-year offer, according to an email from Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann published on Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations website. Under that plan, wages would then grow by 2.5 percent in the second year and 2 percent in the third.Jaeger said he thinks that the changes in salary for the University’s workers that have been proposed thus far are not enough, despite Harvard’s claims that its wage increases are on par with national standards.He said he hopes the “symbolic” location of the demonstrations in front of Mass. Hall will help the union convey its message.“We’re having an interaction with senior administrators by being there,” said Jaeger. “It’s not more than a nod or a smile or a quick word, but for [those] who work there to be reminded consistently that there are important questions that a lot of people feel strongly about is important to us also.”—Staff writer Christine Y.

UPDATE: February 7, 2013, at 7:13 a.m.In the midst of a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/education/law-schools-applications-fall-as-costs-rise-and-jobs-are-cut.html"">nationwide drop in the number of law school applications, Harvard Law School did not see the same dramatic decrease in its application numbers this year that it has in past cycles, according to the school’s Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Jessica L. Soban ’02.As of Jan. 25, the number of law school applicants nationwide this year had decreased by 20.4 percent, according to the Law School Admission Council.“For the past two cycles, we experienced a decline that was similar to the decline in the national pool, but this cycle is shaping up very differently,” Soban wrote in an email.Although applications to the Law School were due last Friday, Feb. 1, Soban said she could not release the number of applicants for this cycle until the fall.
Last year, the Law School witnessed a 14.6 percent decline in applications, a drop that followed a 16.4 percent decrease from 2010 to 2011. Both dips in application numbers were in line with a trend experienced at law schools nationwide.This nationwide pattern might be in part caused by the increasingly competitive nature of the job market for law school graduates.“It’s been a flooded market for a long time, but it’s taken a while for that fact to be brought to the surface,” said Jay Donde, a student at the Law School.But while concern over the job market has plagued students at law schools across the country, employment rates for Harvard Law School graduates have remained somewhat constant over the past 20 years, according to Soban. For the past three years, the Law School’s after-graduation employment rate has been about 95 percent.Kyle P. Elder, a student at Harvard Law School, said that while students might not get their first choice of jobs, Harvard graduates can depend on having options for employment.“Harvard’s Harvard, so you’re always going to be able to get a job,” Elder said.Beyond apprehension over employment prospects, students said potential law school applicants may worry about being able to pay back student loans as law school tuition rates increase nationwide.“[Not including] the top tier of law schools, it’s a lot harder to get a job that can offset the cost of going to school,” said So J. Kim, a student at the Law School.Harvard Law School has attempted to counteract the often off-putting cost of getting a degree, increasing the total financial aid offered by the school by 50 percent over the past five years, mostly through loan repayment assistance and support for public service careers.—Staff writer Dev A.

After a fall semester that saw College students vote in support of a social choice fund and the University announce its plans to create one, Kennedy School students will vote next week on a referendum calling for Harvard to demonstrate a financial commitment to the new fund.The student referendum, which will be voted on next Monday and Tuesday, will be the first ever held at the Kennedy School, according to organizers. It was proposed by a group of students in Responsible Investment @ HKS, an offshoot of the larger Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition.The referendum asks that the University allocate .1 percent—approximately $30 million—of its $30.7 billion endowment to seed Harvard’s social choice fund, which will be launched on July 1.Administrators have said that the new fund will offer donors an opportunity to support the University through channels that account for social responsibility, but they have not indicated whether the University will contribute any existing funds from its endowment to the new social choice fund.Kennedy School student David J. Garfunkel, a member of the responsible investment initiative, said he believes it is important for the University to jumpstart the fund with a substantial initial investment to ensure its longevity.
“The idea of the social choice fund is to show that using responsible investment criteria, we can generate returns in order to contribute to the important work that the University is doing while at the same time upholding our values as a University,” Garfunkel said.Alexander “Alexi” White, a Kennedy School student and member of the initiative’s leadership team, said the referendum is intended to show that the call for socially responsible investment reaches beyond the College.White said he is confident that the referendum will pass, calling it a unifying issue within a diverse school.“This issue touches on everything,” White said.Ten percent of students must sign a petition in order for a student-launched referendum to land on the ballot at the Kennedy School. That plurality—100 students among the approximately 1,000 who attend the Kennedy School—has been surpassed since the group began circulating the petition after the winter recess.“The general feeling is that everybody is very supportive of the measure,” Garfunkel said.If the referendum passes, the group will try to form a coalition of graduate students across the University in support of responsible investment, Garfunkel said.The referendum question will share ballot space with the candidates seeking office in the Kennedy School student government.None of the candidates has taken a stance on the issue, Garfunkel said.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.

In their homeland of North Korea, two sisters struggle to make the difficult decision between remaining faithful to their country or fleeing to the United States in search of a better life. Company One's production of ""You For Me For You,"" playing at the Boston Center for the Arts’ Plaza Theatre through February 16, explores how the loving bond between two sisters can survive amidst political and personal turmoil. This new work, scripted by playwright Mia Chung, succeeds in creating a unique world through realistic and disarming sound effects, superb lighting to transition between scenes, and an insightful script that deeply explores each character's plight.
Junhee (Jordan Clark) and Minjee (Giselle Ty) cope with the dangers of communist North Korea, relying on each other to survive. Throughout the performance, the two actresses maintain a natural banter, a testament to both their acting skill and the accessible script. Ty's body language and expressions cast her convincingly in the role of an older sister in declining health—her hunched shoulders, persistent coughs, and strained voice all contribute to a believable depiction of an ill young woman. The play highlights the struggle of Junhee in her efforts to take care of her older sister. Both Junhee and Minjee are persistent in putting the other before herself, even if that means suffering from political strife. But soon their differing opinions lead to conflict—despite unfair treatment from the North Korean government, Minjee remains steadfast, even stubborn, in her professed nationalism for her country. On the other hand, Junhee is adamant that their best and only chance for survival is to leave their home behind and travel to America. Eventually, Junhee convinces her sister that leaving home for the United States is the better option. 
Chung depicts the stress of adapting to a new country while longing for home through the  exaggerated speaking tropes she creates. In scenes of dialogue with the American characters Tiffany (Anna Waldron) and Wade (Johnnie McQuarley), Junhee struggles to understand English. Because of the rapid and loud nature of the Americans’ speech, it is easier to see how a foreigner may be overwhelmed by American behavior. Clark’s reserved and tacit demeanor as Junhee when she reacts to the Americans contributes to the sympathy Chung creates toward the two sisters in the play, sympathy for their alienation from American life. Fundamental to this alienation is the feeling of an unfamiliar environment created by lighting designer Annie Wiegand and sound designer Brendan Doyle. To exaggerate the contrast between the two countries, scenes that take place in North Korea are dimmer than scenes in the United States. Not only are the lights brighter in America, but sounds, including speech, are also louder. From the first moment that Junhee arrives in the States, the sounds distinctly place the scene in a different location; she is greeted by the clamor of a bustling and noisy train station. To heighten the the sense of oppression in the North Korea setting, Doyle accompanies a tense scene in the doctor’s office with a high-pitched buzzing noise.  Again and again, Chung’s script highlights the contrasts between the two cultures. She draws attention to the characteristic consumerism of American culture with bold quips about American society—at one point Minjee says, “If you feel stress, you take a vacation that shapes your eyebrows.” Throughout the play, other characters also make blatant and occasionally snide references to aspects of American culture. The Smuggler (Michael Tow), who helps the sisters flee North Korea, serves as a stern but realistic voice to show Minjee the differences between life in the two countries. In one jab of his wry commentary, Tow references the perks of the American health care system; he remarks that the government not only provides medicine but even “pays” the sick to take time off.  
“You For Me For You” is a historical and cultural lesson that not only depicts life in a closed-off society, but also tells a tale of transition that might have been overlooked by a Western audience. Even though the play centers on two North Korean sisters, the lighting and sound design, coupled with Chung’s masterful script, help an American audience feel what it might be like to experience these characters' transnational struggle. These vital aspects of the play cast the two sisters in a constantly foreign environment, unable to settle, until finally—disregarded by North Korea’s government and unable to feel connected to American culture—the two sisters find that only with each other can they truly feel at home.—Staff writer Nzuekoh N.

The Harvard men’s basketball team got off to a rough start in its home contest against Dartmouth on Jan. 26, ending the first half down by nine after a 7-for-21 shooting effort. The only thing preventing the team from being blown out on its home floor was the performance of sophomore forward Jonah Travis.The Minneapolis, Minn., native came up big for the Crimson in its second straight Ivy contest against the Big Green, shooting four-for-five from the field in the opening frame and seven-for-nine on the night. And while late-game heroics came from a variety of places, particularly co-captain Christian Webster, Travis’s offensive presence was consistent throughout the game.“He’s what we refer to as a ‘bring your lunch pail, roll up your sleeves, put your hard hat on’ kind of guy,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “And our program needs that. He brings that for our team whether he’s starting or coming off the bench. That’s been his role, doing a lot of the dirty work for our team.”Travis has been a constant performer for the Crimson so far this season. But just a year ago, the sophomore would not have pictured himself as such a key piece of the Harvard lineup.“I knew that it would be a bigger role than last year, but I had no idea by how much,” Travis said. “If you would have told me, I probably wouldn’t have believed you. But I really worked hard this summer just so when an opportunity presented itself, like when the season came, I wouldn’t be knocked back on my heels.”
Standing at just 6’6,” Travis is an unlikely candidate for starting center in a Division I program. But nonetheless, he has stepped into a starting role that last year was filled in large part by former Ivy League Player of the Year Keith Wright, who stands at a still moderately sized 6’8.”Last season, Travis saw an average of 6.5 minutes per game in the post for a then-veteran Crimson squad that had graduated a total of zero seniors from arguably the best team in program history up to that point, fresh off of a share of Harvard’s first Ivy title in program history.Despite Travis’s solid rookie campaign, the move to center this season—where Travis played throughout high school—came as a bit of a surprise.“I wasn’t expecting to play center coming to college,” Travis said. “But if that’s where the team needs me to go, if it’s going to be the best route for our team having success, then I’m all for it.”So far, Amaker seems to agree. While Travis contributed a solid 2.4 points and 1.7 rebounds per game as a freshman on the way to Harvard’s second straight Ancient Eight crown, his presence has been felt to an even greater degree this season. In 2012-13, Travis’s numbers—4.1 rebounds and 8.9 points per game on a league-best 61.8 percent shooting—speak volumes to the improvements he has made in one year.According to Travis, despite being undersized for his position, he has been able to capitalize on his strengths—particularly when underestimated by his opponents.“What I lack in size and maybe overall weight and height, I think I can make up for in just working hard and my footwork and trying to position myself in the right places so that I can be successful,” Travis said. “I have to end up playing a lot smarter just to kind of make up for what I don’t exactly have physically [in some] matchups. I know I always have to try to be in the right position, or I’m usually going to get burned.”Travis also noted that the transition back to center forced him to work on new aspects of his game, adding additional challenges he did not face before college.“I get a lot of slower guys on me, so I can always just sprint to the ball and roll hard to the basket,” he said. “I have to work on that because it doesn’t come naturally to me. In high school, I could just chill right in the lane and ask for the ball. I wasn’t used to sprinting all across the court, setting ball screens and everything, because we never set ball screens in high school.”After seeing non-trivial minutes off the bench in the Crimson’s first few contests, Travis earned his first collegiate start on Dec. 4 in a 79-63 victory over Boston College. Travis did not miss a shot in the contest, converting on all five of his field goal attempts and going four-for-four from the line.

In Kyle Walczak’s house sits a brick. But this is no ordinary brick, given to no ordinary high school student. In the summer of 2011, Walczak attended 4th and 1, a football camp designed to help underprivileged high school football players improve skills both on and off the field. The brick, a memento that Walczak received from his time at the camp last year, symbolizes more than just time spent at a summer camp, however.“At camp, we talk a lot about this concept of building a wall, one brick at a time,” says executive director of 4th and 1 and Harvard Law School alum Vivian Chum. “It’s from a Will Smith interview about how his father tore down a wall and made Will Smith and his brother rebuild it one brick at a time. In his life, he thinks about his success by laying down a brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid, one brick at a time. We talk about, every single time, moving towards a bigger goal by laying down that brick.”In a letter that Walczak wrote to the camp, he talked of the hardships he was going through at home: “I look at my brick often because we recently lost our house because my dad lost his job. I brought my brick to my mom’s home and told her that this is my foundation, [this will] keep me strong. She will not let me down. Just as 4th and 1 did not let me down.”For Walczak and countless other high schoolers who may never have the chance to attend an expensive football camp, 4th and 1 has made a huge impact. Along with training from former NFL players and college football coaches, the camp—held yearly in Michigan and Texas—provides guidance in areas in which ordinary football camps may lack, such as SAT preparation and resume writing.“It pretty much changed my entire life,” says 4th and 1 student athlete Trey Rivera. “Before I hit 4th and 1, I didn’t care about school. I thought it was a waste of time, honestly, but when I started to get more into [the camp], I started realizing that it’s not all about football; you’re going to get tests if you keep playing. What it showed me was that people care about you, and they want you to pass.”
But Rivera and Walczak might never have gotten this opportunity if two law school alums hadn’t had a chance meeting years after their graduation.ROOTS IN CAMBRIDGEDaron Roberts didn’t have a typical start to his career. After graduating from the Kennedy School and the Law School, Roberts decided to pursue a different passion—football.“It was in the summer of 2006, when after working in a couple of law firm jobs, some buddies of mine from my high school football playing days asked me to travel with them in working football camps,” Roberts said. “I did, and I had the best time of my life…. That experience re-ignited my love for football, so I decided to graduate from the law school in June of ’07 and pursue a career in coaching.”Roberts did just that, taking an internship with the Kansas City Chiefs before becoming an assistant coach with the Detroit Lions. It was during his time in Detroit that Chum, writing a feature for ESPN, interviewed Roberts, her former floormate in Ames Hall at the Law School.“He started telling me about his vision for a camp and really from there, it kind of grew out of our discussion,” Chum said. “For a while, when we were developing the idea for this camp, we had phone calls almost every single night, and we just talked about the things we wanted to have at this camp. That was early 2010, and then by July 2010, we had a camp. It was very much that once we had an idea, we had to do it.”Roberts and his sister had previously run a similar camp in Texas, The Next Page, that provided standardized preparation for 15 at-risk minority students, so the idea of running a camp in his hometown in the Lone Star State wasn’t a foreign one.“I thought about combining the philosophy, the mission of The Next Page with football to create a football camp that would include life skills development, SAT and ACT preparation, as well as football skills training, and I went to the same community college where my sister and I had founded The Next Page,” Roberts said. “I went to the board and asked for funding to start a one-week program in which we’d be preparing 30 at-risk students from the East Texas area. The board approved the measure, and we had our first camp in Mount Pleasant, Texas, in the summer of 2010.”MORE THAN FOOTBALLFor one week each summer, 40 high school students, ranging from rising sophomores to rising seniors, pour onto the campuses of Northeast Texas Community College and Michigan State University, ready to learn new football skills from experts in the sport.

Is this you in class? Are you wishing that you hadn't taken those three Gen Eds? If you're having second thoughts about your course selections, Flyby has you covered. We've gone through the course catalogue and picked out some of the strangest classes offered this spring. The descriptions below are our best guesses of what these Gen Eds (plus a bonus Applied Physics course) might have to offer.<!--more--> Fat Chance (Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 14)Flyby Course Description: Is this serious? Fat chance. Bad puns aside, this class sounds like a Harvard version of ""The Biggest Loser."" We expect it will challenge students, or ""contestants,"" to celery-eating contests and physically demanding treks across the Yard. An added bonus for freshmen—anything's better than eating at Annenberg.
Cultural Agents (Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 13)Flyby Course Description: In this class, students will learn spatial reasoning and critical thinking skills through class-wide games of ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"". If you have nostalgia for your childhood or struggle with basic multiplication, we're confident that this is the class for you. By finding the elusive villain all over the world, we fully expect students to come out of the class with a working knowledge of both world geography and times tables.Privacy and Technology (Computer Science 105—Satisfies Culture and Belief)Flyby Course Description: This class on privacy is being taught by Professor Waldo, made famous in the classic children's series ""Where's Waldo?"". Once students are able to find their professor, they will discover the methods of stalking, using both standard social networking sites and more historical methods such as MySpace (a relic of the ancient past). The class will culminate in a final project in which students will be responsible for the cyber-stalking of another student for an entire week.Introduction to Soft Matter (Applied Physics 225)Flyby Course Description: (N.B.: This is not even a Gen Ed, but it does sound fun.) After all the hard work and time necessary for other SPU courses, this course offers a playful return to earlier methods of learning. It consists of a general introduction to the world of Play-Doh. (No, philosophy majors, we didn't misspell Plato.) Students in this course will discover the many different uses of the multicolored, mysterious substance, building sculptures and exploring the different properties of each Play-Doh color. The final project consists of the creation of a medieval castle (with possible extra credit for those who use LEGOs).

Vice President and Nobel Laureate Al Gore ’69 praised recent efforts of Harvard students involved in environment and divestment campaigns during a speech focused on the health hazards of global warming which he gave in Memorial Church on Wednesday night.Hundreds of students and community members lined the Yard in hopes of securing a spot in Memorial Church to hear the man introduced as “in truth, the elected president by America.”Eric S. Chivian ’64, director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, turned the stage over to Gore, whose talk was entitled “Healthy Planet, Healthy People.” The talk was sponsored by CHGE as part of the recently launched Paul R. Epstein Memorial Lecture Series.During his talk, Gore lauded Harvard’s progress in becoming a more sustainable institution.“One of my previous visits here with President Faust was to witness the launching of the Harvard Office of Sustainability,” said Gore. “And now some time has passed and we see extremely impressive results, not least of which is the incredible activism and engagement by students who have contributed to the progress the University has been able to make.”
Gore stated that consequences of global warming are compelling and devastating, but said that he believes in humanity’s ability to effect positive change.“The dangers we face are almost unimaginably dire,” Gore said. “My hope is based on the history of our experience as a species.”Gore said that the warming climate has destructive effects on human health. He noted examples of climate change that have influenced insect behavior and, therefore, the spread of diseases such as West Nile virus.According to Gore, recent health dangers were anticipated by Epstein, a leader in the field of climate change at the Harvard School of Public Health.“Everything that I’ve read to you about these recent findings was anticipated by Paul Epstein,” said Gore. “He wrote seminal papers 12 years ago. He saw the pattern very carefully and he was right. We all have a great debt to him.”Gore voiced his disappointment in the current political system and the lack of discourse related to climate change in the recent presidential election.However, he expressed hope in President Barack Obama’s ability to combat the rising temperature trends.“I am optimistic today also because in his inspiring inaugural address, President Obama made the climate crisis the very first challenge he discussed and spent more words on it than any other. I was thrilled by that.”The idea of the night was change. Gore continually stressed the urgency of the current situation, appealing to the audience with analogies.“We’re using the atmosphere as an open sewer and it’s functionally insane,” Gore quipped.—Staff writer Fatima Mirza can be reached at fmirza@college.harvard.edu.

Speaking at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Wednesday night, Allston residents criticized Harvard’s proposed relocation of some campus services, a move which they say intrudes into a residential area.About 75 members of the Allston-Brighton community packed into a Business School lecture hall for the meeting, which also touched on University-funded community benefits in Allston and mixed-use developments at Barry’s Corner.Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, spoke about Harvard’s intentions for its land in the neighborhood and fielded questions about the University’s plans for construction and its commitment to community benefits.Casey kicked off the meeting by addressing the University’s decision to relocate the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to the planned science complex across the Charles River, a move which University President Drew G. Faust announced at a faculty meeting on Tuesday. Casey said that Harvard will not, as some residents feared, build a development for SEAS beyond the bounds of the proposals it has already submitted to the city of Boston.Some residents argued that while the University is being very specific about plans for its own buildings, it has been much less forthcoming with details of projects intended to benefit the community, such as the Education Portal.
The conversation became particularly heated when it turned to Harvard’s plan to move some of its facilities from 219 Western Ave. to 28 Travis St. Critics took issue primarily with Harvard’s plan to relocate its “fleet management” services to the Travis Street site, which is adjacent to several residential lots. Residents requested that it be moved elsewhere, saying they were worried the plan would increase noise, traffic, and pollution in the neighborhood.“Harvard is proposing to move a maintenance facility on the periphery of our neighborhood into our neighborhood,” said Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alfred.The campus services that would be housed at 28 Travis St. would include mailroom and information technology services, a Harvard police training area, and recycling, storage, and fleet management services.Casey said that the Travis Street location is the only viable place for the facilities and described changes to the plans that he said will address residents’ concerns. A new building for vehicle management, Casey said, will act as a buffer between homes and the loading zones, while a new layout will close off access to Travis Street from the loading area, doubling green space along the road and lessening noise and traffic for the homes across the street.Still, some residents were not satisfied with the University’s proposed solution.“You would walk your children next to a park with all of that?” Alfred asked.The relocation is part of much larger series of plans for Allston that include the construction of a new science complex, a new basketball arena, a hotel and conference center, and other academic and administrative buildings. Harvard first filed a proposal for development with the city in 2007, but halted construction in 2009 because of the economic downturn, a move which angered residents in Allston and Brighton.Harvard announced last summer that it would resume development in the neighborhood and has since filed new, shorter-term plans than the ones it pursued before the recession.—Staff writer Marco J.

Final papers and projects will no longer be due during reading period if a proposal discussed at Wednesday’s Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting comes to fruition.At the meeting, committee chair and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented a proposal that would alter the structure of reading period, committee member and Pforzheimer House resident dean Lisa Boes said in an interview Wednesday evening.Under the proposed schedule, all final course assignments would be due at designated dates during exam period, Boes confirmed. Students would be notified of these due dates at the beginning of the semester.Committee members also discussed adjusting the length of reading period. Currently, reading period usually lasts between seven and eight days, while exam period is typically nine days long. Under the proposal, reading period would lose a day, while exam period would be extended by one day and possibly renamed “final project period,” Boes confirmed.Boes said she supports the proposal because it better defines the last weeks of the semester.
“It also treats the culmination of courses in a comparable way, regardless if the culminating work is a paper or a project or a seated exam,” Boes said. “I think the format [Harris has] proposed is helpful for students because it protects reading period.”Harris did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.Boes also voiced hope that the proposed change would eliminate stress for students, saying she believes two or more papers due within the last days of reading period can cause anxiety.Danny P. Bicknell ’13, former president of the Undergraduate Council, said he believes the plan has the potential to benefit students.“Any proposal that reexamines the true purpose of reading period should be welcomed by students,” Bicknell said, adding that the details of the proposal will need students’ feedback.The Committee on Undergraduate Education is not a decision-making body, and instead offers a forum for the professors, administrators, and students who serve as its members to brainstorm and debate pedagogical changes. For the change to be enacted, the faculty would have to vote on the proposal, which would require an open discussion at a faculty meeting and another discussion by the Faculty Council, according to Boes.UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, who was present at the meeting, said in an interview Wednesday evening that it is important for students to be involved in the discussion going forward. Zhu also said both students and administrators should make sure they are aware of any unintended consequences the change might create.—Staff writer Madeline R.

Dipping into the Harvard archives, FM discovered that the University has put the postal service to work throughout the years. It turns out that the recent letter by alumnus Thomas G. Stemberg’s ’71 is not the first correspondence to make Crimson news. Harvard’s history is fraught with piles of letters, many simply addressed to “Harvard University, Harvard, USA” with questions about math problems, requests for degrees, and even suggestions for world peace. Here are a few of the strangest discoveries:• One man wrote to the University, requesting thatHarvard loan him one million dollars to collectbutterflies. His big sell fell short, reading, “You’rea big strong university, you can stand the strain oflowering one million dollars down here.”• In 1916, another writer had a much simplerrequest. He wrote, “dEar sirs; I am a poor boiewhat wud lik to hav a education an it iz for thisreson that I am riting to you at this time… iwud like to no how i kin ern my way thru skul.” Unfortunately, Harvard did not admit the boy, andspell check was not invented for another 75 years.• In response to a young boy’s written plea for Harvardsports memorabilia in 1949, the University vowedto send pennants to any child upon written request. The Crimson published an article about the deal,entitled, “University Mails Out Sticker PennantsGratis to Urchins.” The free pennants almost madeup for referring to the kids as urchins—almost.• Harvard professors were unable to help a manfrom Cedar Rapids, who wrote to the Universityrequesting instructions for how to catch pigeons. Office workers believed an aspiring carrier pigeonentrepreneur wrote the letter—or at least they hoped.
• More recently, Grace Oberhofer attempted to get off ofthe waitlist by singing a letter to Harvard in a YouTube video. “Harvard, you mean the world to me, on JohnHarvard’s statue I’d never pee,” she crooned. Even though the video, “Dear Harvard,” has over 100,000 views, Harvard never accepted Oberhofer, who now attends Tufts, where she is free to urinate on any statue.Harvard’s mailbox has always been full, whether its contents are condemning, off-key, or just about pigeons. So consider this a thank-you note, Harvard, for putting up with the bizarre—and, as a side note, FM would also like to formally request a pennant.

Freshmen who had not yet grown accustomed to life at Harvard were made a little more so Wednesday evening when they learned their formal dance, previously scheduled for Friday, had been postponed. The cause: a blizzard. Yes, that's right, a blizzard. Forty-five mile per hour winds, feet of snow, near zero visibility—the works. (<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/29/school-closes-hurricane-sandy/"">An Act of God, you ask? Probably not this time, but only time will tell.)<!--more--> Citing transportation hazards and a possible MBTA closure, the freshmen events committee assured students it would announce the date of the rescheduled dance next week. For those wondering if the cancellation is legitimate, Flyby has some stats on the coming storm: the National Weather Service in Boston has forecasted as much as 18 to 24 inches of snow in eastern Massachusetts. To drive this point home further, this is likely more snow than the average Texan sees in his or her lifetime. (We say 'likely' because who knows what global warming will really bring?) 
To those rare freshmen who have been anticipating the tipsy T-surfing, copious chocolate fountains, and a ballroom much too large for a group that just wants to dance really, really close together, we say—what could be more fun than being trapped in the Yard? Occupy liked it. And the snow won't start until Friday, so there's no risk of missing classes or being distracted from catching up on that reading you're already behind on. Formal dances can be rescheduled; blizzards come but once each year. (Unless it's 2011 or you live in Wisconsin.)

A day after the anniversary of his emergence, Jeremy Lin ’10 had a banner night against the Golden State Warriors. Lin scored 28 points on just 16 shots and made a career-high five threes on the day, part of Houston’s 23 from beyond the arc. That mark tied an NBA record and was in large part due to Lin’s nine assists, which led the team.
 
On February 4, 2012, Lin—starting his first game for the New York Knicks—registered career highs in points, rebounds, and assists with a 25-5-7 line against the New Jersey Nets. Lin got the best of All-Star point guard Deron Williams and led the struggling Knicks to a 99-92 victory. His performance spurred of the beginning of Linsanity, a string of seven straight wins that culminated with Lin winning Eastern Conference Player of the Week after his first four starts and playing in the Rising Stars Challenge of the NBA’s All-Star Weekend before getting injured later in the season and missing the playoffs.
 
Lin, who was waived by both the Rockets and the Warriors before the 2011 season, famously lived on his cousin’s couch when he first got to New York—not expecting to stay in the city long enough to need an apartment. After star Carmelo Anthony urged coach Mike D’Antoni to play the Harvard graduate, he became an instant sensation in D’Antoni’s wide-open offense—which caters well to Lin’s specific skill set and allowed him to flourish. 
 
After the season, restricted free agent Lin was encouraged by the Knicks to seek other offers but was expected to resign with the team. Nate Silver <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/keeping-lin-should-make-financial-sense-for-the-knicks/"">wrote in the New York Times that Lin had been worth nearly $600 million to the team since his emergence but after Houston Rockets general manager offered Lin a hefty contract that would have cost the Knicks a sizable amount in luxury tax payments, they chose to let Lin go and replaced him with a combination of Raymond Felton and Jason Kidd.
 
Lin has struggled in Houston to adapt to a new offense in which he is playing off the ball. The team’s trade for James Harden right before the season meant that Lin could not dominate the ball as he did in New York. Lin had adjusted as a spot-up shooter and is rebounding and assisting at roughly the same rate as last year and cut his turnovers at the same time. He leads a surprising Rockets team that currently holds a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive West. His three-point percentage is down overall but has increased by at least thirty points each month and this month he is shooting 5-10 from behind the arc. 
 
&nbsp;
At the age of 24, Lin has vanished from the limelight that pursued him in New York. The storylines are abundant—as a Harvard graduate and the first Asian-American star since Yao Ming, he has generated a lot of publicity (and controversy, with racially insensitive remarks after his emergence)—but he has a long way to grow. Lin was +37 in plus/minus on Tuesday, his best performance of the year in that category and a sign of future growth. His story is only a year old, but it is far from over.

On August 30 of last year, the email was sent out. Soon after, the news <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/#article-comments"">broke publicly. We all know the story. A cheating scandal, the largest this campus has ever known—or in <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/#article-comments"">the words of Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, one “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory”—had been uncovered and was under full-fledged investigation. The course was Government 1310, and the professor Matthew B. Platt.After five months, we can say with a bit of confidence that the administration bears a considerable amount of blame for the harmful way in which proceedings were carried out. Specifically, the glacial pace of the Administrative Board process caused students undue stress and exposed the need for substantial reform. The picture that is forming before us implicates the class and school just as much as many accused students. This was a process fraught with institutional failure, and it is one that deserves not just our attention, but also our action.The scandal was first discovered when, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/12/platt-letter-reveals-scandal/"">in mid-May, Platt and some of his teaching fellows noticed glaring similarities in the content and structure of different exams’ answers, as well as a typo repeated exactly by multiple students. From there one would assume the investigation took off with full force and speed, since Platt already <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/12/platt-letter-reveals-scandal/"">suspected 13 of his students of plagiarism and had contacted the Ad Board regarding such. Yet it took the administration as many as three months to notify some students. This is where the investigation’s process should first be called into question. The immensity of the case, implicating <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/12/platt-letter-reveals-scandal/"">roughly 125 of the class’s 279 students, could be seen as reason for the delay. Even when taking into account that large scope, though, three months remains an inexplicably and inexcusably long amount of time needed to look over the exams.This slow pace of the investigation did not come without severe consequence, either. Investigated students and alumni made public early on the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/1/ad-board-accused-students/"">burdensome uncertainty that the late August announcement placed on them, an uncertainty only heightened for those left without a verdict until late fall. The stress this created caused some students to, despite maintaining their innocence, withdraw <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/5/cheating-scandal-concerns-linger/"">before their cases were even heard out of fear that their tuition and board fees might go to waste. Most others who similarly feared <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/13/accused-tuition-fees/"">financial waste went on with their semesters anyway but remained ever tormented by the looming possibility of having to withdraw. The issue of such financial inequity, determined arbitrarily by when in the semester a student would have to leave, has <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/5/cheating-scandal-concerns-linger/"">since been addressed by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael Smith. This address came all too late, though, for the many students who had already suffered in believing that they might have had to sink their tuition and board costs if asked to withdraw.Such uncertainty was a burden on the implicated students not only during the investigation, but also during last term’s now-controversial exam period. Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and prominent alumnus Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 have both <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/1/cheating-scandal-smith-withdraw/"">voiced their disappointment with how the course in question was run, noting that it was known campus-wide as an easy A. Yet despite this reputation, it appears Professor Platt significantly <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/4/government-exam-harder-questions/"">altered the course’s style for the spring of 2012 and in doing so made its exams not only tougher, but also less clear in what they asked of students. Some students also said that collaboration was historically known to be a part of the course’s exams, but again the 2012 changes lead to new guidelines on what was and was not prohibited. Adding to the confusion, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/"">comments made by students in the Q Guide last spring suggest that some teaching fellows for the course helped students on the final exam by defining terms and discussing questions.
If teaching staff did not observe exam policies, one can hardly expect students to. While collaboration was prohibited on paper, in practice it seems that the opposite was perceived to be true, and so uncertainty in what was and wasn’t allowed among students and teaching fellows enabled the collaboration that would later be punished.So yes, students that withdrew may have cheated on their final exams—in fact, several most definitely did via brazen copy-pasting—but the teaching staff and Ad Board failed to provide those same students with the process they deserved. Beyond simply highlighting the necessity of academic integrity, this scandal also highlights the necessity of good teaching, of clear policy, and of fair process. The student body should not just hope but also actively urge that in each of these areas Harvard improve. We should demand clearer collaboration policies, fewer poorly managed courses, and more timely Ad Board processes. Perhaps the scandal will ultimately prove important as an instigator of change rather than just as a stain on Harvard’s reputation.Students shouldn’t cheat, and we should always work to reduce both academic dishonesty and the environments that facilitate it. But equally important is that students not be left in academic limbo while their case is worked out for months.

It began with a kind of ache—throbbing, persistent. It was a “down” period like those I’d had before, except that the “down” now crept into the rest of each day, each week, until it became my new normal. It was mental, at first; “I just think too much,” I would joke to my parents. “I have to stop thinking so big.”Shortly into the semester, though, it spread. It became physical: panic attacks came in debilitating waves, tears threatened to pierce any conversation. I would sit curled up at the corner of my bed and the wall, knees to my chest, shaking. I would try to sleep but couldn’t. Everything took longer. I had readings to do and papers to write, but they were to be done alone, and when I was alone I could let myself crumble.During these months, it was somehow very important to me that no one knew this was happening. I spent less and less time with people, less and less time outside my room, so I had the strength to pretend everything was fine the few hours I was not alone. I cried into my pillow so my roommates wouldn’t hear. I would sit in history lecture as a panic attack came on and blink back tears, terrified that someone would notice. I wondered how everyone but me was so fine. Knowing I needed to spend time away, I applied to study abroad, which would elicit fewer questions than “taking time off.” I continued to isolate myself, which made me feel worse, which led to further isolation: It was a vicious cycle. I had never felt so alone.If there’s anything this past year has taught me, it is how wrong I was. I was not alone. I am not alone. It is heartbreaking that it has taken, in part, two student suicides to realize this. Harvard, I think, is realizing it too. Along with such tragedies, the past year has witnessed emerging sources of hope: a Kirkland House <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/18/faust-addresses-mental-health/"">discussion with President Drew G. Faust during which students raised questions on mental health; a suicide panel of student and recent alumni <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/8/harvard-community-kindness/"">voices; a Crimson <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/10/suicide-harvard-mental-health/"">series on mental health at Harvard; and a <a href=""http://mentalhealthmatters-harvard.tumblr.com/"">Tumblr devoted to the same issues.These discussions have sought to explain and understand student mental health at Harvard, broaching topics from services at UHS to a pervading atmosphere diagnosed, eloquently and memorably as <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/17/harvard-many-feel-out/"">“I Am Fine.” I cannot say with any kind of certainty where Harvard’s mental health problem—because we do, indeed, have a problem—comes from. Many of us, often, are far from fine. What I can say with certainty is that the conversation must go on.
This semester, we hope to write a long series of articles in an attempt to do just that. I am writing as a member of Harvard’s Student Mental Health Liaisons, a student group founded in 2008 to engage and inform students on issues of emotional wellbeing. Since getting involved with SMHL last fall, I have been inspired by the sincerity and earnestness of each member and the group as a whole in raising awareness on a broad swath of mental health issues on and beyond campus.There needs to be a forum and catalyst for continuing discussions of mental health, and for establishing a community that supports improving mental health at Harvard. We plan to publish regular op-eds on a variety of topics this semester. We also want to hear from students, faculty, and other members of the Harvard community, who should get in touch with us through the <a href=""http://www.harvardsmiles.org/?page_id=3239"">contact section of our Harvard SMHL website so that their voices can be heard as well.Let us keep the topic of mental and emotional wellbeing at the forefront this semester. In different ways we have all struggled, or are struggling, or will struggle, during our years at Harvard. I don’t think we can ever fully eliminate all difficulties. But we can work toward this by approaching them with empathy, compassion, and a desire to listen. We can tackle them with the knowledge that we are not alone.Victoria A.

Defense secretary Leon E. Panetta’s recent announcement that the military will officially lift its ban on women in combat roles was heralded by many as a leap forward for equality in an important American institution, and bemoaned by others as a case of sacrificing efficiency for political propriety. Given that men have dominated every aspect of the U.S. military since its inception, the move is a welcome recognition of women’s critical role in the modern armed forces. Action on this issue, however, is long overdue.Lifting the ban on women in combat is one of many apparently progressive, but ultimately common sense moves that took a long time to adopt. As with other significant institutional changes, rational decision-making on this issue is precluded by what psychologists call loss aversion. When weighing future possibilities, we humans tend to have a much greater fear of suffering negative consequences than of missing out on positive consequences of equal magnitude.For example, few people would take a bet in which they had a 90 percent chance to win $10 and a 10 percent chance to lose $90, even though the expected value of the bet is neutral. This choice seems perfectly reasonable, as $1 gained is worth slightly less than $1 lost, due to diminishing returns. Furthermore, it may be desirable for an organization like the military to be risk-averse in uncertain situations. However, the striking effects of loss aversion cannot be explained simply by diminishing returns and rational avoidance of risk.In Daniel Kahneman’s recent book, “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” he points to several studies that have shown humans tend to weigh negative outcomes approximately twice as heavily as positive ones. In other words, to convince the average human to accept a bet in which there was a 50 percent chance of winning and a 50 percent chance of losing, the potential winnings would need to be twice as great as the potential losses. You would not accept a 10 percent chance to lose $90 until the alternate possibility was to gain $20.Setting aside any argument about gender equality (I will return to this momentarily), the decision over whether to lift the ban is essentially a complicated version of the gamble presented above. Any significant change in institutional policy will bring with it unforeseeable consequences. Women may not be as big and strong as men, but they are also less impulsive and may make better decisions in combat. We will not realize all the results of putting men and women side by side on the battlefield until we have actually done so; for now, the best we can do is predict what will happen. This type of situation inevitably leads to irrational thinking, and the military’s decision-making process was undoubtedly affected by loss aversion.
We can forgive loss aversion in many contexts because it is an inherent part of human decision-making and usually harms only those who make irrational choices. Loss aversion may cause a small business owner to forego investment in a new technology that would most likely benefit the business and increase profits until the technology has been more widely adopted. In this case only the business owner, and perhaps a few employees, are hurt by the mistake.  Few would argue that all citizens have a moral imperative to make rational profit-maximizing decisions because of the incremental benefits (in taxes paid) to all other citizens.Here, however, a moral element comes in. The military’s decision regarding the ban is not only relevant to those making the choice; it affects an entire class of people who have historically been discriminated against in the organization. There may be no moral obligation to reform irrational decision-making when only private interests are at stake, but in this case, women have received unfair treatment.As the military warmed to the idea of women in combat, loss aversion caused it to needlessly drag its feet on the issue until the perceived benefits so heavily outweighed the potential costs that the ban was lifted. We did not need to wait this long. In cases such as this one, we have an obligation to use rational judgment so that loss aversion does not cause unnecessarily prolonged discrimination.Now that the ban has been lifted, it seems that we have already leapt over whatever rational or irrational hurdles stood in the way of putting women in combat, but the transition will almost certainly not pass without a snag. There will be cases in which women make bad decisions on the battlefield, as men already do, and there may be cases in which a woman fails to succeed at a task that, in hindsight, a man might have been better equipped to perform. Unfortunately, these bumps in the road will probably receive more coverage than cases in which excellent choices made by female troops lead to important military successes.We owe all the women who want to serve this country a fair evaluation, based not on our instinctive reactions but on a carefully considered cost-benefit analysis. In the next few years, we will have the opportunity not just to predict, but to observe the real results of putting women in the same combat roles as men. My intuition is that a few small but well-publicized problems will be far less important than the significant benefits that will come from adding to the military’s talent pool. I can only hope that our natural instinct to highlight the negative does not overshadow the positive effects that we see from this change.Nick M.

""I’ll see you at the bill-signing,” President George W. Bush <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19149972/ns/world_news-europe/t/bush-vows-immigration-bill-will-be-signed/#.UQmGZ6FU59k"">told reporters, referring to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, a bipartisan effort to fix the United States’ broken immigration system. But the signing never came. Instead, the bill <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s2611"">died in the House of Representatives, and millions of undocumented workers remained in the shadows.Now, seven years later, our country faces a similar opportunity for positive change: A group of eight senators, four Democrats and four Republicans, recently <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/us/politics/senators-unveil-bipartisan-immigration-principles.html"">announced a plan to draft comprehensive immigration reform legislation by March and bring it to a vote before Congress’s summer recess. On the heels of their announcement, President Obama <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/politics/obama-issues-call-for-immigration-overhaul.html?hp"">unveiled his own blueprint for reform. Although it is heartening to see Congress and the White House heading in the same direction, President Obama’s vision for reform has a leg up on the Senate’s. Most importantly, the President’s plan more immediately addresses the needs of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.Those who <a href=""http://www.fairus.org/news/president-s-immigration-reform-plan-places-interests-of-illegal-aliens-ahead-of-americans-says-fair"">argue that legalizing immigrants would hurt American workers and taxpayers are misguided in their beliefs. In reality, an immigration overhaul that strengthens border security, minimizes hiring of undocumented workers, and streamlines legal immigration, while opening a pathway to full citizenship for undocumented workers already in the U.S., could solve a host of problems for current citizens and foreigners alike.For one thing, many businesses knowingly hire undocumented workers well below the minimum wage, allowing them to turn a higher profit than businesses that play by the rules. This harms law-abiding companies, the middle class, and the economy as a whole. What’s more, many immigrants study in universities where they earn skills that could help the economy flourish, and then have no other option but to turn around and head back home—doubtless many students at Harvard fit this bill. Often, these students create new, exciting industries abroad, industries that end up bolstering the economies of our competitors when they could have strengthened our own.Both President Obama and the senators pushing for immigration reform recognize these facts, but the senators seek to delay immigrants from applying for permanent citizenship until the government has taken <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pitfalls-ahead-for-senators-immigration-plan/2013/01/29/60bf908e-6a1d-11e2-ada3-d86a4806d5ee_story.html"">steps to stem additional immigration—like securing the border, implementing systems to track visas, and checking the legal status of workers. Under the Senate plan, immigrants could immediately gain <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/29/fact-sheet-fixing-our-broken-immigration-system-so-everyone-plays-rules"">provisional legal status if they met national security and criminal background checks and paid back taxes and a fine. But afterwards, they would remain in a state of limbo for who knows how long, ineligible for federal benefits like health care subsidies. President Obama, on the other hand, would allow immigrants who had been granted provisional legal status the ability to embark on the road to full citizenship right away.
The President’s approach makes far more sense than the Senate’s. First off, it will be a long while till our border is anywhere near completely secure. This, coupled with the time it will take for the existing immigration backlogs to clear, may cause many immigrants not to see citizenship in their lifetimes. Besides, it seems unfair to name a group of people legal U.S. residents and then not allow them to become citizens on the same terms as everyone else. After all, efforts to secure the border are irrelevant when dealing with immigrants who have already crossed it—it is not as if people who are living here illegally are reaping the benefits of more immigrants entering. If we plan to legalize undocumented residents, we should not hold their rights to become full citizens hostage to policy initiatives that are out of their control and that do not change their own lives or legal status.President Bush may have said, “I’ll see you at the bill-signing,” but another (perhaps greater) president once <a href=""http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780061447549"">called the United States “a nation of immigrants.” Today, we should remember John F. Kennedy’s words. We should remember that we are all descended from immigrants, even if our ancestors traveled here on the Mayflower. We should remember that our country grew to become the most powerful in the world not in spite of, but because of the people who came from abroad to make it great. And in that spirit, let us hope for comprehensive immigration reform that will give undocumented residents a real chance to make it even greater.Molly L. Roberts ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Holworthy Hall. Her column appears on alternate Thursdays.

Harvard rang in the new semester last Thursday with its fourth annual “Harvard Thinks Big,” an event that featured six different Harvard professors, as well as a student, giving 10-minute speeches. FM recently acquired a list of speeches that didn’t make the cut. They are presented below in their full glory:“This Republic of Hot Yoga”—Presented by Drew G. FaustThe event’s keynote speaker, Faust enthusiastically bounces onto the stage wearing her signature neon spandex shorts and headband. “Who’s ready to roll?!” Faust asks the crowd, which had expected a lecture on the Civil War.“What the ‘N.’ Stands For: The Greg Mankiw Story”— Presented by N. Gregory MankiwMankiw walks to the stage to thesound of deafening applause. Uponarriving to the podium, he takes out anew copy of Principles of Economics,his bestselling economics textbook,and encourages the audience topurchase it (“not the used edition!”).After discovering that the speech willnot count as one of his mandatoryEc 10 lectures, he leaves the stage,leaving preceptor David Johnson tofinish the remainder of the speech.
“This is Harvard Thinks Big”—Presented by David J. Malan ’99The words “This is Harvard Thinks Big” are on the big screen, but where is David Malan? There he is, flying on to the Sanders Theater stage wearing an Iron Man suit. As he lands, his team of lady dancers, clad in CS50 lingerie, rush on stage and shoot t-shirts into the stands using their patented CS50 t-shirt guns. He concludes with a five minute slideshow featuring the CS50 TFs.“My Thoughts on Life”—Presented by Larry H. SummersAddressing the crowd in a smooth,baritone voice, the former presidentof the university says nothingcontroversial or offensive in theslightest.“What I Do: An Explanation of My Job”—Presented by Evelyn HammondsHammonds leaves the stage. Five minutes later, she comes back with a basket of Boloco burritos.

After two close opening games, freshman Saumya Karki and sophomore Julianne Chu found themselves playing catch-up. But Harvard’s No. 5 and No. 8 rallied to win each of their next three games, as the No. 2 Crimson women’s squash team (10-1, 4-1 Ivy) swept the second wave to clinch a 7-2 team victory over No. 4 Trinity (14-2).“I couldn’t be happier with the team’s performance today,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “Individually, [in] each match a lot of girls who have been kind of working on certain areas of weakness really stepped up today and really proved that they are really learning from every match and building.”Harvard sealed the deal during the second rotation of the night, as wins from Chu, Karki, and No. 2 Laura Gemmell put the Crimson up, 5-1. Although the wave was Harvard’s only perfect rotation, it produced some of the Crimson’s closest match-ups of the evening.Gemmell defeated Bantams junior tri-captain Catalina Palaez in four closely-contested sets at the No. 2 position, 12-10, 10-12, 11-8, 11-7. Gemmell and Harvard No. 1 Amanda Sobhy remain undefeated this year.At the No. 5 position, Karki dropped her first game before taking three tight sets to best Trinity tri-captain Robyn Hodgson, 8-11, 11-8, 11-9, 11-9.
Chu similarly gritted out four close games at the No. 8 position to earn Harvard’s decisive fifth win of the night. The sophomore edged Bantams junior Jennifer Pellentier, 8-11, 11-8, 12-10,11-8.“They were able to come back and win, which showed really good character,” freshman Michelle Gemmell said of Chu and Karki. “I was really proud of them.”Harvard emerged victorious at the top five positions Wednesday evening. The Crimson opened with a strong 2-1 performance in the first wave.At the No. 9 position, Isabelle Dowling defeated Trinity sophomore Chanel Erasmus, 11-7, 13-11, 11-7. Kingshott fell to Bantams sophomore Natalie Babjukova, 5-11, 11-6, 11-9, 11-9, at the No. 6 position.At the No. 3 position, Haley Mendez took Harvard’s only five-game win of the night. The sophomore rallied from 1-0 to beat Trinity junior Wee Nee Low, 9-11, 11-7, 11-7, 6-11, 11-3.After the Crimson sealed the win in the second wave, the final rotation was just a formality. But in an interesting development, Amanda Sobhy’s streak of perfection came to an end.The sophomore skated through her rookie season, posting a perfect 15-0 record without losing a set and earning all-Ivy and Player and Rookie of the Year honors.This year, she kept the streak going through four matches, starting each at the No. 1 position. Although she picked up her fifth win tonight, it came at the cost of her perfect collegiate record.The reigning CSA champion dropped a game for the first time in her college career, as Trinity freshman Kanzy El Defrawy earned the first point at the No. 1 position Wednesday evening. Starting from an unfamiliar position, Sobhy nevertheless swept to victory with convincing wins in the next three games, defeating El Defrawy, 6-11, 11-2, 11-6, 11-3, to give Harvard its seventh and final individual match of the night.Michelle Gemmell also won for the Crimson at the No. 4 position with a three-game win over Bantams sophomore Ashley Tidman, 11-8, 13-11, 11-6. Trinity freshman Sachika Balvani defeated Harvard co-captain Sarah Mumanachit, 5-11, 9-11, 11-5, 11-5, 11-8.The win was Harvard’s first against a top-5 opponent after the Crimson’s 5-4 loss to Princeton earlier this month.“I think it gives us a huge vote of confidence, especially after Princeton,” Kingshott said. “We put in so much work, identifying areas of improvement, and the performances of the team as a whole and in the individual matches was a testament to how strong our training has been.“Trinity had a close match with Yale two weeks ago, so this was a good litmus test for us going into the weekend,” Kingshott added.Harvard will visit Brown today before hosting Yale on Sunday to close out its regular season. The CSA Team Championships begin a week from this Friday.—Staff writer Michael D. Ledecky can be reached at mledecky@college.harvard.edu.

During a recent tumble through cyberspace, Flyby came across this old photograph of Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., brother of President John F. Kennedy '40, chilling in Winthrop's Gore courtyard. The acronym that never was, JPK graduated from Harvard in 1938 and attended Harvard Law School before enlisting in the Navy during World War II (he was later killed in action). Here, Joe keeps things classy but casual in a sport coat while reminding us that our genes will never be as good-looking as his. If you're suffering from a particularly strong case of Kennedy nostalgia, head over to Winthrop House and sit where JPK once sat. The JFK Suite is located just a few yards away, in F entryway.

Even families have hierarchies—I mean look at the Kardashians. My family hierarchy has always been clearly defined. My mom was the boss with the wallet, my brother just bossed me around, and I was the bottom of the bucket: the chump of the family. Then we got a dog. We are not a pet family. Once we had a dog, named Pepper. It was horrible, to say the least. She scratched every inch of glass on the back French doors, chewed through the back gate, and destroyed my black lab stuffed animal that coincidentally was also named Pepper. When that didn’t work out, Pepper had to go live on a nice farm.  It’s amazing that after almost a decade, my mom let my brother get another dog. She was already not a fan of animals inside the house, and no one could forget the destruction that Pepper left in her wake. My mom and I were prepared for accidents inside the house and mayhem everywhere. But Hanzo was perfect. 
 He was everything we wanted in a dog. The little Shiba Inu was smart, potty-trained, and as cute as could be. He even rang a bell when he wanted to use the bathroom. He was so perfect that I suddenly found myself even further down the totem pole. Hanzo is an early riser for sure. Let the games begin at 6:30 a.m. But don’t worry. My mom always shut my brother’s door to be sure that he gets plenty of sleep. Sadly, my door remained open and I got to wake up to the sound of Hanzo ringing the bell to go outside and play. I thought breaks were supposed to mean sleeping in, but there I was playing with the energetic fur ball as I watched the sun start to peak its rays out. How was I supposed to kick around a soccer ball when I was still trying to wipe the sleep out of my eyes? The worst part is that Hanzo knows he is higher than me in the family hierarchy. Shiba Inus are pack dog and all about the rankings. Sure, we love each other, but it’d be nice if he listened to me occasionally.  Come.Hanzo! Come!Seriously come inside! Okay whatever. See if I care. Hanzo listens to everyone else, but he seems to know that I’m the pushover in the family. He won’t even try begging my brother for food, but I’m his go to girl.  But maybe being at the bottom of the hierarchy isn’t as bad as I’m making it out to be. Adding Hanzo to the family means that our trio has now become a quartet. It means that there’s another family member to love and be loved by. I’ll take all of that even if it means being at the bottom of the dog pile.

The only beverage available in chemo is ginger ale, and it is diet. I don’t realize this until I pour myself a saccharine Styrofoam cup. “Rinse off the top of the can,” my grandma says, unwrapping cheese crackers to offer my aunt and me. I bring wet cans for the two of us. My grandmother says she doesn’t want any, pouring more sound and gesture into the statement than seems possible. My aunt in the reclining chair hears me cough and asks the nurse to get me a mask.My grandmother has been coming here weekly, off and on, for as long as I can remember, which probably explains why I have only recently realized that this is frightening. There is a way of thinking about the body when you have not known acutely what it is to fear, a way that washes your childhood thin, until you can see through it like tissue paper.She has been featured in the local cancer center’s calendar as Ms. June, an image we have hanging on the wall of our laundry room. I like to flip through the book. In it, each month’s model is quoted saying something inspiring. She says she trusts God. I tear into the rim of the Styrofoam cup, even though my first-grade teacher told me that ripping Styrofoam is bad for the environment. I decide I trust people in surgical masks, intimations of divinity, the way bodies spiral out of themselves at good kinds of touch.We talk about the flu, how it’s an emergency in Boston, how reluctant well-meaning people are to get flu shots. I move my mask onto my face when I cough. My grandmother gives me 15 bucks.“Because I am worried you won’t have any money until you get back to school,” she says. “When you are driving later, I want you to lock the car doors. You don’t know what people can do.”
As I’m about to go, I pour the half-full cup of pale yellow soda down the drain. It burps and fizzles. Afterwards, I drive slowly, conscious of the edges of the road.

“Ya no quedan cafés como este,” my professor informs us as we walk up Calle Dr. Drumen to El Brillante. The little street is littered with mismatched storefront signs, some old, others crooked. They signal a few run-down bodegas, two hotels, one Starbucks. El Brillante’s green awning is among them, printed with loopy white script that sports a gaudy star over the ‘i.’ When we reach the café, the nine of us—a group of Spanish literature students—file through the glass door and into the fluorescent-lit interior. My professor holds the door for us.We are here in Madrid for one rainy January week. He spent the past semester teaching us about the literature and architecture of the city at the turn of the century. Now is our chance to see it all for ourselves: the neighborhood where Trapeillo based his short stories, Moneo’s modern extension to the Museo del Prado, the skyscrapers built to compete with the scales of London and Paris.But before we head out each morning to wander, we stop in at El Brillante. The place does not have the glamorous, intricate interior one might expect from a European café. Rather, it features a scuffed linoleum floor, photographs of meal combos hung along the walls, and metal-topped bars that stretch the length of the narrow eatery. The bars lead down to another set of double doors that open onto the parallel street, Paseo de Sta. María de la Cabeza. Men in neatly pressed navy blue uniforms stand behind the counter, taking brusque orders. Everyone (but us, of course) is a regular. Nadie pide la carta.My professor explains that this is the way cafés in Madrid used to be: sparse and unwelcoming, with waiters that remembered your name, your family’s background, who your plumber was, that your mother-in-law visited last weekend, and, naturally, your order.He had a friend once—una puertorriqueña—who lived a block away from El Brillante. She ate breakfast here every morning and ordered the same thing almost always. One day, something came up and she left Spain, went back to Puerto Rico, or perhaps to the United States. When she returned to Madrid those years later, she stopped in at El Brillante. Before she could close the door behind her that first time back, the waiter turned to her and asked, “¿Lo de siempre, señora?”

The land here in the Navajo Nation seems to stretch infinitely under a weightless sky: orange cliffs, vistas spotted under snow, and in the middle of it all, the occasional home.Twenty minutes off the main road and up a muddy path—the weather’s been a bit colder this January, but it’s left more slush than ice—the octagonal structure of a hogan appears, connected as one building to the side of a small, plain ranch.Inside, Marcy, as I’ll call her, sits on her bed beneath one of the windows, wearing layered sweaters and two different colored socks. She greets us with a shining grin that reflects off newly plastered walls, and a bright gaze that falls slightly past our eyes.Marcy is blind and diabetic. Last year, a doctor was brought here to see if anything might improve her health, but 87 years make some things irreversible. We are here delivering food that might last a week, and firewood that will last less than that. In winters like this, water tanks freeze and supplies run short, but right now the near 50-degree weather and spotless sky are deceiving. Inside the hogan, it’s warm.“Ya’a’teh,” I say, all I know in Diné, or Navajo: Hello. Marcy’s hands, soft and smooth, take mine and wrap them in a slow shake. A neighbor helps translate the Navajo I can’t understand: Marcy’s caretaker constantly checks up on her, she says, and her daughter lives right next door—in one of the only three other houses outside for as far as I can see.
Hogans, I’m told, embody a sense of community; for generations, entire families have lived in one circular room, eating from the same central stove, together. Even with renovations and additions, a natural continuity grounds reservation life.Out here there’s an unspoken pride in having direction; guided from house to house, we’re often told to go north or south but find that we don’t know one way from the other. As we leave, Marcy looks—sees—out her door. Its frame faces east like in all hogans, oriented so that in the morning, the rising sun pours its light inside.

When you die, one of the first things the hospital gives your loved ones is a plastic bag with your belongings. It’s the same sort of sterile plastic bag that you get when you throw up on yourself and would rather not wear your soiled sweatshirt home. When your loved ones are ready, they’ll open it to find earrings, a scarf, and other things you couldn’t take with you to the afterlife.My best friend’s mother died the day after Christmas this winter. There were still poinsettias in the church during Suzy’s funeral, and my friend asked in a murmur if I thought the color inappropriate. I told her that I didn’t think anyone would make the connection. I wondered if the room found comfort in the pastor’s words, if they even knew how to respond to his routine “peace be with you.” Normally, one has some time to separate the materials that constitute memories from those one feels comfortable donating. People comb through things they’ve never seen before and weigh sentimental value against space efficiency. But Alivia, a teenager with little storage space and no way to pay rent beyond January, faced the assignment of power-purging her former home of her deceased mother’s belongings. It was fortuitous timing in some ways, mainly because Alivia’s good friends were on a break from school and could help her. I was there so often that one could probably explain my present tolerance of cat dander by calling my stay “allergy exposure therapy.” We ate cheesecake, blasted One Direction, looked through Suzy’s photos from fashion design school, and wondered what in the hell we were going to do with the giant looms in the corner. When you die, your house becomes a dumpster of sorts, and those whom you leave behind are left to scavenge at will. I kept a wallet of Suzy’s. It’s a 90s-utilitarian, ugly, pink thing that I never saw her use. Maybe she never did. But when I see that wallet sitting on my desk, I don’t think about the wallet itself. Actually, I’ve probably spent a little more time smelling it than looking at it. It has that same smoky, yet fresh smell that overpowered me every time I walked into Alivia’s apartment.
Alivia is afraid that she’ll forget certain things about her mother. It’s only natural; in some ways, it seems like so much of her mother’s identity is in a landfill now. Alivia lost so much that is tangible that she believes she’ll forget what was perceptible—her mother’s face, what her voice sounded like, maybe even what she smelled like.What she will remember, however, is moments in time with her mother. She won’t forget calling her mom during the occasional walk of shame (or, as my roommate emphasizes, “stride of pride”) and telling her mother/best friend about her night. She won’t forget when her mom took the lead in a parents’ rendition of one of our show choir performances (and did her booty-poppin’ daughter proud). What she truly gave her daughter never took as solid a form as something that she wove or sewed, but it will inevitably last longer.The two giant looms—at which Suzy spent hours each day weaving—will likely end up either pathetically disassembled in storage somewhere or in a stranger’s house. They’ll practically become invisible to Alivia, but as soon as she thinks about coming home from school each day, she’ll see her mother look up from her weaving to greet her. When you die, maybe your belongings become a metaphor for your body. What is palpable melts away, freeing what is truly you. Their apartment is barer than ever, but I don’t think it’s empty. It’s filled with more substantial things than looms or photographs or even a smoky scent. It’s immaterial.

Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” disappeared spring semester of 2013 at its home of courses.cs50.net. It is three years old.A wide range of students from different sports teams—from basketball to football to baseball—all confirmed the disappearance. After years of popularity, when it seemed to have it all figured out, Government 1310’s life took an unexpected turn. Last year, some students saw Government 1310’s behavior change as it began to act unpredictably. About Government 1310, one student anonymously told the QGuide, “I got shafted.”Government 1310’s disappearance prompted a search for new classes. Many students found an alternative in Sociology 43: “Social Interaction.”If a student had been contacted about Government 1310’s disappearance, he might have said the exact same thing as the student before him, who might have said the same thing as the student before him.Government 1310 has left a note on courses.cs50.net that it will return in Spring ’14. If you know the whereabouts of the course beforehand, or see a class that fits this description, please contact the nearest thesis-writing senior immediately.

It’s day 29 of being home for winter break, and I am starting to get a taste of what it’s going to take to become a real woman living in the real world. I have high hopes of eventually being employed someday. If it happens, it will be magical.To get employed, my mom tells me, I will need to attend an interview. I will need to look presentable in said interview, she says, a cut above my signature jeans and ponytail. This means the unthinkable: I will need to go shopping.I avoid malls like I avoid that kid in section, and do a pretty good job of it: My last mall visit happened in middle school. Today, I re-enter. Shut in a changing room I experiment with “business outfits,” which are broader-shouldered and bulkier than normal-person clothing. My body looks portly beneath the frumpy fabric, so my mom recommends I try adding heels—a clothing item I tend to wear for approximately 15 minutes each semester on the way to a formal. (I slide them off the second I arrive at the dance, like all practical souls do.) Heels are important, my mom says, because they make one look elevated and elegant. Looks like the day will involve purchasing more than a pantsuit.Fresh out of DSW with my first pair of stilettos, mom mentions that she has plans to get her eyebrows waxed the next day and wonders if I want to do the same. She casually questions when I last had someone look at my eyebrows, and I casually answer that it was quite a while back. She feigns a half-smile and nods.When the Vietnamese lady who owns the local nail and waxing shop squats down and stares into my face, she screams. Not a gasp, but a full-fledged screech that causes all the middle-aged women getting pedicures to snap their heads in my direction and giggle. “Lot of work to do,” the owner sighs, pointing me towards her operating table of waxation.
She does not mess around. Seconds later I am stretched out horizontally getting a full-face wax. The thin baby hair coating my cheeks, neck, chin, upper lip all disappears, ripped away strip by hot wax strip. I writhe and crinkle my face with each of her pulls. “This is torture, right?” she chuckles.Once my face is hairless, Mom wants to know about the hair on top of my head—the hair that’s supposed to be there. To her surprise, I had very responsibly gotten my hair cut two weeks ago (point for me!). What mom really wants to know, though, is the last time I blow-dried my hair. Womp womp. I do not own a hair dryer…or a hairbrush. Combs work just fine.Mom begins to enlighten me with her mystical hair care knowledge. Apparently there’s a way to prevent hair from looking “limp” and “plastered to one’s forehead,” and it involves using a hair dryer along with multiple models of hairbrushes. Her tone is loving and understanding, with only a very slight edge of accusation.Two hours later, we’ve purchased a hair dryer and my face is still blotchy red. Perturbed about my quite visible facely tenderness, my mom infers that perhaps the problem is one of moisture. I’m really not the face type—I’ve never been into makeup or face washing, and I was not aware that face moisturizing was a thing people did. Mom hands me a bottle of Olay and advises me to moisturize my face and neck every night. “Got to prevent those wrinkles!” she chimes.While we’re on the subject of faces, Mom decides to go for gold. We will confront the dreaded final frontier: makeup. Makeup cannot be explained; it must be handed down experientially.When we get home I meet her in her bathroom, stare into its wide mirror lined with glowing bulbs. Mom has prepared the counter by laying her beauty products out across the counter so that the whole bathroom looks like a paint studio: fluffy brushes, open-faced pallets holding powders colored rose and peach.She swishes her brushes into the powders, dots the skin-tone speckles all over my face as if she’s replicating Seurat’s pointillism. Blush goes in a thin oval above the cheekbones, while concealer saves the day by covering the baggy evidence of sleep-deprivation that hangs below my eye sockets.I gaze into the mirror at a newly moisturized, freshly plucked and powdered face. The strands of my hair are dryer-kissed and tattered with flyaways. What will the employers think?

The Republican Party must increase the diversity of its ideas and members to achieve electoral success, according to five prominent Republicans who spoke at a panel discussion at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Wednesday night.“I think that young people care very much about having a more open society,” panelist and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry M. Healey ’82 told her audience. She named gay rights and environmentalism as issues that matter to the nation’s younger voters.Healey was joined on the panel by Ronald I. Christie and Karen Hughes—both members of former President George W. Bush’s inner circle—as well as CNN contributor Ana Navarro and John Murray, former deputy chief of staff to U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric Cantor. At the event, which was hosted by the Institute of Politics and moderated by IOP director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, all five panelists urged their party to incorporate a greater variety of perspectives.Christie kicked off the discussion by saying the GOP has erred by not making a greater effort to reach out to young people and people of color. It has also made a mistake by behaving in a way that seems “hostile” and “angry” to some, he said.Panelists also reflected on the GOP’s poor showing in last November’s election, which saw Democrats retain their grip on the White House and strengthen their hold on the Senate. Navarro said that she blames the GOP’s failure to appeal to diverse groups for its disappointing performance.
“We had bad outreach, we had a bad message,” she said, adding that she believes Republicans can “sound to others as righteous, judgmental people.”To rectify these problems, “I don’t think Republicans need to shift, but to accept diversity of thought,” Navarro said.Panelists agreed that the party should seek ideological diversity by embracing voters who may not identify as Republicans. In this vein, Healey said that libertarians and moderates must be invited into a “coalition of conservatives,” which could coalesce around issues such as international affairs, fiscal policy, and states’ rights.At times, panelists went beyond merely reflecting on the party’s past to instead comment on its future.Healey, who served as membership secretary for the Harvard Republican Club when it had only 12 members, told the audience she will not seek the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts recently vacated by Secretary of State John F. Kerry.“But I promise we’re going to have a wonderful, wonderful candidate,” said Healey, who did not reveal which possible contender she supported.—Staff writer Steven R.

Greater efforts should be taken to integrate scientific research into policies, Paul M. Nurse, the president of the Royal Society, said at the Science and Democracy Lecture Series on Wednesday evening.Nurse, along with a panel of esteemed colleagues, emphasized “the primacy of the individual” in the face of a changing landscape for science and research.“Scientific inquiry is concerned with acquiring knowledge of the natural world and ourselves. We’re interested in applying that knowledge,” Nurse said.The panelists, MIT biology professor Eric S. Lander, physics professor Lisa J. Randall ’84, and history of science professor Charles Rosenberg, shared their diverse academic perspectives on the benefits and challenges of integrating science and policy.Some of the obstacles derive from the permanent and irreversible nature of the reforms, Randall said.
Nurse cited current issues such as climate change and genetically modified crops to demonstrate the need to fund focused research.Reflecting on the challenge of selecting reliable researchers from a pool of grant applicants, Nurse conveyed his approach to funding science: pick “people not projects.”While Nurse emphasized applied research, he and the panelists spoke to the importance of broad research as well, recalling the original function of the Royal Society to encourage innovation and academic curiosity.“With both [Harvard and the Royal Society], it was about finding a venue in which knowledge could be shared,” said Everett Mendelsohn, a history of science professor.In the 19th century, when Harvard’s interactions with the Royal Society were frequent, both were serving as scientific research institutions.But by the 20th century, the Society had shifted focus to being “the public face of established science in Britain,” said Alex Csiszar, who teaches history of science.Moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor of environmental science and public policy Sheila Jasanoff, the lecture was co-sponsored by Harvard’s Center for the Environment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Graduate School of Design.—Staff writer Jessica A.

DISCLAIMER: Due to the alarming amount of bias in the following piece, it must be clarified that the author has intimate ties to the subject. By that, I obviously mean the aspiring to intimate ties kind.Ma chère Marion,Marion. My life, my lust. Ma-ri-on: the sound of each syllable contorting everything from lips to throat to, on three, turn the mouth into a Cheerio. Ma. Rrgghrri. On.You walked into Farkas wearing a tailored, asymmetric black and white striped blouse and could’ve walked away with more than just a golden Pudding Pot. You could’ve had me…in a state of catatonic fangirl shock, eager to mumble incoherent adulations to you in person.Yet you chose to postpone our destined encounter for fame and glory. At first this seemed vain, but after seeing your black heel-less boots (I mean, who DOES that?#inspiration) and your Namaste to the hosts, I was convinced otherwise. Not to mention that slight millisecond when you looked in my general direction, said, “I love being kissed,” and added, “You are good kissers.” Now, I prefer subtle flattery, but hey girl. Hey.
Accepting the Hasty Pudding Theatrical’s tasks was the most sincere form of courtship I’ve witnessed in my brief existence. Proving yourself to me in front of a room full of people who paid to see you? Unbelievably romantic. The one thing I did not appreciate was Leonardo DiCaprio’s “guest appearance.” Come on. A ménage à trois seemed like a great idea at the time, OK?After Leo—whom I confess I still have a thing for—revealed that completing a particular task would free you from meta-dreams, you persevered like the goddess that you are. You left a visibly diseased Gwyneth Paltrow speechless when you flawlessly acted out a death scene, impersonated Forrest Gump with a Donald Duck-esque Southern accent, and apologized for the debacle that was “Nine.” [(Tearfully.) I forgive you.] Both Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso could not live up to the existential self-portrait you insightfully captioned “REALLY GOOD DEAD PERSON.” Even Édith Piaf herself seemed negligible after your screechy rendition of “Non, je ne regrette rien.”Oh yeah, and the Hasty Pudding Theatricals put on a show of sorts at the end. I mean, I guess they were ridiculously talented or whatever, but I only have eyes for you, mon amour. The back of your head, that is, but still.Bisoux.

As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences awaits its planned move across the river to Allston, the school is in search of short term solutions to immediate problems created by a lack of space.In anticipation of Tuesday’s announcement, last month SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray appointed a space steering committee to inform decisions about the school’s long-term space needs.The committee will meet with architectural consultants to provide input on the design process of SEAS’s Allston presence, said former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68—one of the co-chairs of the committee. The new campus will eventually be located in Harvard’s science complex, construction on which is slated to resume in 2014 and should be completed in late 2017 or early 2018.Murray has also tasked the committee with investigating short-term solutions to SEAS’ space needs while it awaits the completion of its Allston facilities. Beginning in March and continuing into the summer, SEAS will relocate several of its administrative offices to a temporary space at 20 University Rd. in Harvard Square, referred to by Executive Dean G. Timothy Bowman as “SEAS South.”Bowman wrote in an email to The Crimson that the move will serve as a short-term “Band Aid” solution for the school’s immediate space needs.
“Moving these offices to 20 University Road will free up some space, addressing our pressing need to accommodate existing research and provide modern, studio-style classrooms and teaching labs right away for our undergraduate courses,” Bowman wrote.The temporary location will house the staff of SEAS’s finance, research administration, human resources, communications, and development offices.Lewis said the creation of SEAS South demonstrates the current crunch on space resources felt by the school.“It’s evidence for why the big move [to Allston] is happening,” Lewis said. “In order to make room for faculty growth and so on, they have to free up some office space around here.”Professor David A. Weitz, the other co-chair of the committee, said he felt a sense of urgency because of the space challenges facing SEAS.“SEAS is crowded, there’s no space,” Weitz said. “We can’t do research, we can’t teach.”He added that even so, he was optimistic about the school’s eventual move to Allston.“There’s only one challenge in my view, and that’s to make sure that SEAS remains part of the University,” Weitz said.“As long as we overcome that, there’s no challenges, there’s only excitement and opportunity.”—Staff writer Brian C.

If you're tired of spending night after night at a Grafton Group Restaurant or sick of wandering up and down Mt. Auburn Street searching for a party, look no further. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/17/the-sinclair-opening-gallery/"">The Sinclair, a new concert venue and restaurant located at 52 Church St., has opened its doors to the Square.<!--more--> The Sinclair is the newest concert venue backed by The Bowery Presents, the New York-based booking company behind such iconic spaces as the Bowery Ballroom and Terminal 5. Now, for the price of a movie ticket, you can go see a concert in the Square and possibly splurge for a nice meal afterward.  The Harvard Square location presented a unique challenge to The Bowery Presents because of Cambridge's puritanical liquor laws, which forbid nightclub licenses; businesses cannot serve alcohol without food. In the face of such restrictions, Bowery decided to go into the restaurant business at The Sinclair, a bold move for a company that had never done so before.

 The resulting space—part restaurant, part concert venue—provides a unique addition to a Square in need of new nightlife options. Though Harvard Square lacks nightclubs like New Haven's ubiquitous Toad's Place (and doesn't even have a movie theater, for that matter), The Sinclair concert venue may begin to fill that void with a large wraparound balcony, a maximum capacity of 525 people, and, most importantly, three bars. In order to attract students, The Sinclair has worked to provide affordable concerts and meals for its patrons. According to Josh Bhatti, the head of Bowery Presents: Boston, 80 percent of the concerts at the Sinclair cost less than 20 dollars. ""We wanted our prices to be accessible so that people can come back multiple times,"" Bhatti says. In addition, very few concerts have a 21-plus age restriction, making it easier for students to attend. Unfortunately, one does have to be 21+ to enjoy the three bars.Check out FM's full review of the Sinclair <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/the-sinclair-new-restaurant/"">here, and visit the magazine landing page for more FM content.

Fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and addressed the throngs of Americans crowded onto the National Mall.“I have a dream,” he said, “that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.’”These words, among the first of a new nation, have not been taken lightly.On Monday, Jan. 21, two miles down the National Mall from the Lincoln Memorial, President Barack Obama echoed Dr. King. From the steps of the Capitol, Obama called for an end to inequality and, just like those great orators before him, summoned a new generation to fight discrimination. “Our journey is not complete,” Obama said, ”until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.”There on the lawn of the Capitol, I couldn’t help but smile with pride as my president called out for gay equality and voting equality and women’s equality.
Woven throughout his speech, Obama referenced great prose of the American past. “My fellow Americans”: He quoted John F. Kennedy. “We the people”: He harkened back to the American Constitution. “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” reminded his listeners of this country’s Declaration of Independence. And when he said that the founders gave to us “a government of, and by, and for the people,” Obama echoed the words that were engraved in the stone of the Lincoln Memorial in front of him across the mall.“Our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,” Lincoln said 150 years ago, “conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”“Now,” he continued, “we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.”And with the 262 words of the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln established that the bloodiest feud in American history was fought for the survival of a young nation, a nation still trying to live up to its founders’ expectations—that in this country, on this new continent, all men would be recognized as equals. And Lincoln proclaimed:“We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom. And that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.”Abraham Lincoln said, “The world will little note nor long remember what we say here.”It seems to me, Mr. President, that what we say might be the only thing the world will long remember.

A group of Harvard students has launched a campaign protesting international Hillel policies banning partnerships with student groups that “support boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions against the State of Israel.”The campaign, called Open Hillel and spearheaded by the Hillel-affiliated student group Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance, officially launched Jan. 31 with a petition to Hillel International that had already gathered more than 430 signatures as of press time early Thursday morning.The PJA came up with the idea for Open Hillel after it was prevented from holding an event at Harvard Hillel co-sponsored by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, a group concerned with the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, according to previous PJA chair Emily S. Unger ’13.“We feel that these policies end up preventing dialogue [and] collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian groups and excluding some Jewish groups from the Jewish community based on their political views,” Unger said. “Hillel...should not exclude anyone from the community based on their politics.”Harvard Hillel’s executive director Jonah C. Steinberg, who Unger said has met with the PJA several times to discuss Hillel’s policy, wrote in an email that although he believes it is important for students to participate in discussions about Israel that engage multiple perspectives, the boycott, divestment, and sanctions campaign “is out of keeping with that aim because it encourages alienation rather than constructive connection in relation to Israel.”
“I firmly believe that there is a very important distinction to be drawn between allowing and fostering dialogue, on the one hand, and underwriting and supporting institutional partnerships with [boycott, divestment, and sanctions] campaigns, on the other,” Steinberg wrote in an email to Harvard Hillel’s board members Jan. 31.Unger said she hopes that if enough people sign the online petition, the PJA will be able to convince the Harvard Hillel Board to modify its rules to make them more inclusive.Harvard’s campaign has already garnered attention from student groups on other college campuses. According to Unger, the PJA is in contact with students at Tufts University, Brown University, Binghamton University, and Brandeis University who also hope to change international Hillel policies. The petition on Open Hillel’s website is open to all and has been signed by people identifying as students from a variety of schools including Tufts, Temple University, and the University of California, San Diego.“We’re trying to make it so that Hillel is open to more people. We’re not protesting Hillel,” said Unger. “One of Hillel’s central values is pluralism, and we think that should be extended to political views on Israel as well as to religious pluralism.”—Staff writer Melody Y.

If you’re tired of spending night after night at a Grafton Group Restaurant or sick of wandering up and down Mt Auburn St searching for a party, look no further. The Sinclair, a new concert venue and restaurant located at 52 Church St., has opened to the Square.The Sinclair is the newest concert venue backed by The Bowery Presents, the New York-based booking company behind such iconic spaces as the Bowery Ballroom and Terminal 5. Now, for the price of a movie ticket, you can go see a concert in the Square and possibly splurge for a nice meal afterward. The food will cost a little more than, say, Bertucci’s, but The Sinclair offers a much better atmosphere than an Italian chain restaurant.The Harvard Square location presented a unique challenge to The Bowery Presents because of Cambridge’s puritanical liquor laws, which forbid nightclub licenses; businesses cannot serve alcohol without food. In the face of such restrictions, Bowery decided to go into the restaurant business at The Sinclair, a bold move for a company that had never done so before.The resulting space—part restaurant, part concert venue—provides a unique addition to a Square in need of new nightlife options. Though Harvard  Square lacks nightclubs like New Haven’s ubiquitous Toad’s Place (or even a movie theater, for that matter), The Sinclair concert venue may fill some of that void with a large wraparound balcony, a maximum capacity of 525 people, and, most importantly, three bars.“The idea behind the [concert] space is to be able to have views from everywhere,” says Josh Bhatti, the head of The Bowery Presents: Boston, who spent two years working on The Sinclair prior to its opening. According to Bhatti, the large stage and balcony allow the audience to get as close to the performers as possible, in order to “concentrate the energy” of the room. Indeed, the stage seems massive. It’s hard to believe that this space can fit right in the middle of the Square.
With its relatively small capacity compared to other concert venues, The Sinclair will feature more up-and-comers than hit acts, but The Bowery Presents’ connections within the music industry have allowed them to plan for about 200 events per year in the space. “A lot of the bands are coming to us,” Bhatti says. Recent performances include a New Year’s event with Deer Tick and a sold out Duncan Sheik concert last week.Bhatti also advertises that The Sinclair will be available to rent out for events on the nights without planned concerts, which could present exciting opportunities for student groups constantly in need of venues for theatrical productions, charity fundraisers, or social gatherings. Also, it has three bars.Bhatti hopes the space will mirror New York’s Mercury Lounge, a precursor to the Bowery Ballroom with a capacity of 200 people, which hosted the White Stripes, LCD Soundsystem, and Arcade Fire before they went on to mainstream success. “This size is really exciting for bands,” says Bhatti. “You’re going to go tell 20 friends who won’t have heard of them about the concert. The idea being that when [the band] takes off more people will know about them.”Off to a Fast StartFinally opening in December after multiple construction delays, The Sinclair has enjoyed early success. It has sold out eight of its last 10 shows, according to Bhatti. “The reaction’s been fantastic,” says Bhatti. “People are really excited about how the room feels, how it looks.”Bhatti partly attributes this positive feedback to the staff’s friendly demeanor. The bartenders are trained to be inviting, he says, and there are no bouncers at the door. Instead, the event staff check ID’s. “People act how they’re treated, and if you walk in and the guy at the door is just a bully or a meathead, it makes you feel you have the ability to act like that too,” says Bhatti.Yet getting to opening day at The Sinclair was not a seamless process. The venue’s many construction delays reached comical levels, preventing the venue’s opening by over a month and leading to the creation of a Tumblr called “The Sinclair is Not Open.” The fact that the restaurant’s opening fell in the middle of January right after the holiday season was not ideal, Bhatti assented, but luckily business has been good thus far.Bhatti chalks up the delays to the widely held desire to get everything absolutely right in both spaces. “We wanted a space that would last, we plan on being here for a long time,” Bhatti says.Affordability MattersIn order to attract students, the Sinclair has worked to provide affordable concerts and meals for its patrons. According to Bhatti, 80 percent of the concerts at the Sinclair cost below 20 dollars. “We wanted our prices to be accessible so that people can come back multiple times,” Bhatti says. In addition, very few concerts have a 21-plus age restriction, making it easier for students to attend.The Bowery Presents also worked to keep the restaurant “elevated, yet accessible.” The menu, designed by executive Chef Michael Schlow, features dinner entrees that hover around 20 dollars, as well as a less expensive late night menu. “Our price points were huge to us,” Bhatti says, “We try to keep ticket prices really low, and serving food that felt overpriced just felt disingenuous.”The restaurant has a transportation theme, complete with custom subway tiles and maps. Bhatti says he wanted the design of the space to have a connecting thread while avoiding “kitsch.” The Sinclair also sought to distinguish itself from the tavern feel of Grafton Group restaurants, and went with a more “bunkery” vibe, he says. The Sinclair will also be able to utilize its outdoor patio in the spring: take that, Charlie’s Kitchen!Bhatti pitches The Sinclair as a place to spend an entire evening—moving from the restaurant to the concert space—or to just stop by as one fun part of your night.Either way, Bhatti says, “You’re going to come here and be treated well. Better than any music venue in town—I guarantee it.” He continues, “Hopefully it’s that place that two years later, 10 years later you’ll be able to say, ‘Oh yeah, I saw that band at the Sinclair.’”

6:35 p.m.An old man sits and hums to himself in the Pit by the Harvard T-stop. Resting on his shoulder, a full-sized Tibetan flag flits and flutters in the wind, its sunny streaks of red and cobalt lighting up the January night.A woman in her mid-20s wearing high-heeled boots and a black coat emerges from Dunster Street to sit beside the old man. They fall naturally into conversation and are soon joined by another young Tibetan in a blue hoodie. The older man passes a worn composition notebook to the younger one, who pens his signature at the bottom of a long list of names. He is number 2,354. Next to his signature he scrawls a note in the margin: “Free Tibet!”This composition notebook logs all of the guests who attend the weekly Tibet Freedom Vigil in the Harvard Square Pit. The tradition began in March 2008 in response to a significant Tibetan uprising, in which those living in Tibet broke out in riots protesting Chinese occupation of their homeland. Demonstrations began in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, then spread throughout the country and the world. Fueled by the renewed urgency and spirit of the Tibetans back home, a group of young Tibetan activists in Boston decided to stand in solidarity with their compatriots.“For a lot of young Tibetans it was the first time [in their lifetimes] that something dramatic had happened inside Tibet. It was happening today—not in historical context,” says Tsepa Bayul, one of the founding organizers of the Tibet Freedom Vigil in Harvard Square who was 22 at the time of the 2008 protest. “We figured we would go out in the streets, talk to other Tibetan supporters, and figure out what to do.”
Tibetans chose the Harvard Pit as their demonstration local because of its visibility and tendency to attract tourists from all over the world. Ever since Harvard Square’s first vigil on March 14, 2008, a core group of Tibetans has gathered every week with banners, flags, and a microphone to educate passersby on the Chinese government’s human rights violations in Tibet. They have not missed a single Wednesday.6:57 p.m.Vigilpala steps up to the microphone.  His real name is Tsering Dongshi, but he goes by Vigilpala, or “vigil father” in Tibetan, due to his perfect attendance at the Harvard Square Vigil.  Vigilpala begins with traditional Tibetan chanting: low, reverberating tones that to foreign ears sound like the deep gurglings of a tape recorder on half speed. He will chant until around 8 p.m. and then close the vigil with the Dalai Lama’s prayer, the Tibetan Uprising Song, and the Tibetan National Anthem.Bayul and his fellow organizers, Ngawang Jorden and Dhondup Phunkhang, began the Wednesday vigil tradition as a way for the Tibetan community in Boston to participate in the international Lhakar movement.  Derived from the Tibetan words “white Wednesday” to celebrate the purity of the Dalai Lama’s soul day, Lhakar embraces the power of strategic nonviolent resistance against China. As part of Lhakar, Tibetans pledge to preserve their culture every Wednesday, by wearing traditional Tibetan clothing, mentioning Tibet on social media, shopping at Tibetan-owned stores, or attending a Tibetan protest. In doing so, Tibetans strengthen and perpetuate their culture, one that many believe China is trying to dilute in its occupation of the region.For Tibetans, complaints concerning the Chinese occupation abound: According to many in Boston’s Tibetan community, China imposes religious restrictions on Tibetans, closes Tibetan schools to wipe out use of the language, tortures and kidnaps Tibetans, and incentivizes wide-scale Han Chinese migration to Tibet as part of what some call an “ethnic cleansing” project As a result, many Tibetans living in Tibet have responded with self-immolation, the practice of setting oneself on fire. Nearly 100 self-immolations by Tibetans within Tibet have been reported since February 2009, according to Tibetan rights organizations.“Tibetans inside Tibet have been so oppressed by the Chinese government that they see self-immolation as the only resort for a speaking voice. These self-immolations have been done strategically, so that the outside world can act upon them,” argues Tenzin Yangchen, a board member of Students for a Free Tibet and the Secretary General of the Tibetan Association of Boston, which has over 600 members. “Their sacrifices will go in vain if we as Tibetans, as human rights supporters, don’t do something to carry on their voice.” According to Havard Divinity School student Joshua Eaton ’10, an activist and journalist who specializes in Tibetan issues, those within Tibet have heard about the existence of the vigil in Harvard Square, and they know others are speaking on their behalf.Ngawang Jorden, another of the vigil’s founding organizers, believes the vigil has helped alter the perspectives of many locals. Jorden says that a Chinese man once slipped him a $100 bill at the vigil, explaining that he strongly supported the Tibetan community but that he could not admit so in China without consequences. Jorden also remembers a three-year-old toddler, a boy who was not Tibetan, who demanded to be taken to the weekly vigil by his parents.“Our struggle is not something we can just look at. If you are creating a shoe, you see the result.  Our struggle is not like that—ours has lasted 50 years,” explains Jorden. “It’s a slow process, but little by little I think we do change people’s minds.”7:02 p.m.The shine of headlights from Mass. Ave commuters appears like bright stripes across the faces of the 20 or so Tibetans who have assembled for this Wednesday’s protest. They have come prepared with signs and artwork. One hand-written poster demands “Human Rights for Tibet.” Another sign depicts a baby blue cloud with the text: “Tibet Freedom Vigil—Every Wednesday 6-8 p.m. Harvard Sq.—Until Tibet is Free.”

Three times a week Charley M. Falletta ’16 beats the sunrise awake. Physical training at 6:30 a.m., an early-morning military science class, a weekly leadership lab: These commitments frame the rhythm of Falletta’s weeks here at Harvard in her position in the U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. The terms of Falletta’s ROTC scholarship will require her to complete four years of active duty, plus four on reserve. None of these roles would necessarily bring Falletta into combat. But beginning in January 2016, for the first time, they could.Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Leon E. Pannetta announced that the Pentagon would overturn the military’s official policy banning women from serving in combat forces. The ban has been in effect since 1994. Pannetta’s announcement was met with widespread acclaim from those who say that reversing such policies promotes equality and fairness and recognizes of women who have already served in de facto combat roles in the past. Detractors claim that differing physical abilities and the danger of sexual crimes perpetrated by the enemy, for example, will threaten the security of the armed forces abroad.For the ROTC cadets at Harvard interviewed by FM, the issue of serving in combat is often not a personal one. “It’s not what I want,” says Madison L. Coveno ’14, an Air Force ROTC cadet, referring to entering combat. The force’s brassy blue uniforms have always been comforting to Coveno, reminding her of her childhood: Her father was in the Air Force for 20 years. In general, according to Coveno, Air Force pilots play a relatively indirect role in combat. “Personally,” she adds, “I want something a little more intellectually stimulating.”While women make up around 14 percent of all armed forces, Coveno estimates her field training group to be about 25 percent women. Falletta, meanwhile, says that her battalion—made up of cadets from Harvard, Tufts, and MIT—is about 40 percent women. “Not everyone is going in who wants to be in infantry,” says Falletta. Infantry, or combat roles, are far from the only possible path for women in ROTC, whose roles could include public relations, leadership positions on American bases, or other non-combat duties.But as the number of women in the armed forces continue to grow, and as the terms of the Pentagon’s announcement continue to be debated, other lingering questions are being dredged up: What is it really like to be a woman in the military? To what extent has an older, male-dominated norm remained?
None of the students contacted for this article claim to have felt discriminated against as women in ROTC. “I’d speak very highly of all the cadets, especially the Harvard cadets,” says Falletta. She acknowledges that physical differences do exist between males and females in ROTC, but hasn’t felt any kind of prejudice (despite her petite five-foot frame).Coveno agrees, at least with regards to Harvard. During a summer training camp, though, she recalls an incident involving a leadership simulation, in which some cadets were required to move sand bags and others patrolled the surroundings. The male leader immediately set the three women present to be the guards. “We took offense against that,” says Coveno. “We said, ‘hey, we can carry sandbags. We’re not weaklings.’”Nevertheless, Coveno doesn’t see this kind of event as a major roadblock. “You run into things,” she says, “it happens, but you can solve it—you can talk about it.”Carolyn F. Pushaw ’16, a member of Naval ROTC, has experienced similar instances of tension. Pushaw completed a program similar to but unaffiliated with ROTC in high school. “There was surprisingly a lot of sexism,” she says of the program.  Pushaw claims that on one carrier, for example, the officer in charge treated all of the females present differently from their male counterparts. He wouldn’t let the women go anywhere without being in a group, and would bar them from certain activities, Pushaw says. “I’ve found that in ROTC it’s a lot more equal,” she adds.Pushaw has also become frustrated with the distinct physical standards to which male and female cadets are held. While a woman can pass the required run—a mile and a half—with a 13:30 time, a man must complete it two minutes faster. For Pushaw, all members should be held to the same standards—even, and especially, as women join in combat. “If only two women can pass through to infantry,” she says, “that’s what should happen.”“They shouldn’t change standards to encourage women to do it,” she adds, “because that will compromise their overall operations.”In reality, as multiple news sources have reported, women have been in positions of direct combat since the 1994 ban. More than 280,000 women have been deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, 800 have been wounded, and over 130 killed, according to The New York Times. The armed forces’ definition of “combat,” however, rests on a delicate web of bureaucracy in which language can make or break a promotion.""I think it’s been a real slap in the face to women who were, frankly, serving in combat, to say that these positions were barred to women,” says Falletta. Without holding one of these positions, opportunities like going to ranger school or infantry training, in addition to being promoted, were also closed to women. “So essentially,” Falletta adds, “women were serving alongside men, but men were receiving this training that women hadn’t received.”“So I think,” she concludes, “this is hugely important.”Coveno agrees that some of the greatest impact of the change will involve women who have already served. “Even though they’re functionally there, being put in under-fire situations,” she says, “they’re not getting credited for it.”Pushaw, despite her frustration with different physical standards between men and women in the military, fully supports the introduction of women into combat roles. Particularly in the current conflict, she says, women will be of direct use on the front lines. In many Middle Eastern cultures, she says, “There’s such a gender divide that we need women to associate with Middle Eastern women in situations where men can’t really do that.”Pushaw acknowledges that the gender relations in the military are far from perfect. Sexual harassment and sexual assault are worryingly high in the armed forces now, according to the media. Yet she says she believes that introducing women into combat could be fundamental to addressing this issue. “If men had to rely on women in situations in which they might protect their lives,” she says, “they would see them less as objects of sexual desire and more as equals.”“This is one of the last bastions of a really gender-segregated institution,” Pushaw says. “How will that ever change unless we start now?”Note: All those interviewed for this article agreed to speak in their capacity as individuals, not as official representatives of any ROTC.

The tutorial system is a recognition of this truth. The most important benefit conferred by the direct contact between a student and a tutor is just this: that the student may receive a new stimulus to intellectual development and respond to it by what is truly an awakening of his more or less dormant powers. The tutorial system not only is a powerful instrument for effecting such a transformation, but is helping to bring it about earlier in the student's career than was formerly possible.February 7, 1953:<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1953/2/7/corporation-ups-college-tuition-to-800/"">Corporation Ups College Tuition to $800; Sports Fees, Tickets Included; Costs Hiked In GSAS, Education, Public AdministrationProvost Buck's tuition recommendations were approved in full, the Corporation revealed yesterday.

Dunster House Dining HallDirected by Katherine Moon '14Music Directed by George X. Fu '13Produced by Stephanie A. Havens '14 and Marina P. Chen '15
   The Dunster House Opera is notable for being completely run by Harvard undergraduates—this winter, from head to glass slipper. Opening in Dunster Dining Hall on Saturday, this rendition of Jules Massenet’s “Cinderella” (“Cendrillon,” in itsoriginal French) uses an enormous cast, over a dozen named parts, and a shortened script to tell the classic fairy tale.Director Katherine E. Moon ’14 says the DHO team chose “Cinderella” because it involves as many undergraduate performers as possible: the opera has many main parts and a chorus that is on stage for more than half the production. “We knew the talent that existed on campus, and we wanted to make sure that there were roles to fill and then some,” she says.The two leads will be played by Adams House roommates Amelia H. Ross ’14 (Cinderella) and Allison A. Ray ’14 (Prince Charming), a casting that is in keeping with Massenet’s double soprano singing parts. “[Ray and Ross] have such chemistry together because they’re roommates and best friends. We had to choose them,” co-producer Stephanie A. Havens ’14 says. Because of Ray’s strong vocals and connection with her roommate on stage, Havens decided to maintain the original score’s soprano, and therefore female, Prince Charming.“It was a no brainer,” Havens says.In addition to including many of Harvard’s talented opera singers, DHO’s “Cinderella” is meant to be an audience-friendly modern adaptation. The script itself is accessible because it both maintains the intended comedy of Massenet’s “Cendrillon” and is comically enhanced by the opera’s sometimes spotty translation, Havens says. “We think the audience would enjoy something more comic,” Havens’s co-producer Marina P. Chen ’15 says. Also in an effort to make the opera accessible, Moon and music director George X. Fu ’13 cut DHO’s version of “Cinderella” to a short two hours (including intermission). “If you don’t know anything about opera, this is a great one to come to because we reduced it to make it really digestible and watchable,” Moon says.

The course enrollment statistics <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/4/stat-104-enrollment-spring/"">published on Friday show that exciting classes can attract new students and appeal to broad audiences. This semester, 642 students enrolled in Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics.” Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the US: Medicine and Disease in Social Context” grew from 265 students last year to 408 this year. The diversity of popular courses demonstrates that engaging and relevant material, combined with great teaching, can encourage students to investigate new fields that they would not otherwise discover.Introductory classes are often the gateway to concentrations, and interesting classes have the power to give new life to smaller, less considered fields. Back in 2003, we <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/2/24/computer-science-classes-see-dipping-enrollments/"">reported that enrollment in computer science courses had plummeted. Before David J. Malan ’99 took over instruction for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” the course still enrolled just <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/9/16/students-course-cs50-courses/"">132 students. But the pedagogical strength and reputation of CS50 led to its renewal. In fall 2012, CS50 <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/9/10/course-enrollment-ec10-cs50/"">drew 651 students, and the class has <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/13/cs-greatest-growth-seas/"">inspired students to pursue further studies in the field. Enrollment in Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” has been rising steadily, with 240 students registered this spring. Without a popular class like CS50, students may never have discovered their interest in computer science. While genuine interest in a subject may survive a boring, dry class, it takes an engaging class to make students aware of interests they never knew they had.But even when these classes are taken on their own merit and not as part of a path to a potential concentration, they are a powerful part of the educational experience. Of the hundreds of students per class who take Stat 104, only a small handful will pursue a degree in statistics. Similarly, only a fraction of CS50 students will graduate from Harvard with a computer science degree. But in a world where problems cut across disciplines, the high course enrollments in courses that teach the essential tools of a field are encouraging. Harvard provides the opportunity for students in the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences to apply tools from other fields to their own areas of interest. The enrollment numbers show that students are taking advantage of that opportunity.The key to these courses is often good teaching. While courses like Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” regularly report huge enrollments because of already-prevalent student interest in economics, courses that seek to attract students to new fields need good teaching. CS50 has gained a huge following among undergrads in part because of the course’s commitment to innovative teaching. Any concentration that hopes to attract new students by offering an accessible introductory course needs to think seriously about pedagogy, and the result is courses that raise the bar for teaching at Harvard.Exposing students to new fields and varied modes of thought should be an objective of the Harvard experience. This is especially crucial for fields like computer science, where it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of innovation in both technical and humanistic spheres lies. This spring’s most popular courses indicate that students are pursuing fields that will allow them to explore and enrich themselves.

The week after Harvard made an announcement intended to put to rest its largest cheating investigation in recent memory, faculty members said they need to do a better job communicating course expectations to students and laying down the groundwork for academic honesty at a time when technology is blurring the lines of right and wrong.Citing a lack of information from the University, faculty members interviewed for this article were hesitant to remark on the administration’s handling of the Government 1310 case, in which about <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/"">125 students were investigated for inappropriately collaborating on a take-home final in assistant government professor Matthew B. Platt’s “Introduction to Congress” course last spring. Instead, in private conversations and departmental meetings, professors said they have begun to examine the source of the problem and the role that they might play in combatting it.History professor Andrew D. Gordon, who teaches a General Education course on Japanese history, said that based on the limited information faculty members have received, he thinks that the professor and students are jointly culpable in the Government 1310 case.Drawing an analogy, he explained that the situation is comparable to the professor who leaves the house each morning without locking the door.“You can say that the professor should have known better than to not lock his door because there are people who do dishonest things,” Gordon said, “but it still doesn’t mean it’s right to go in to steal stuff.”
Gordon added that faculty members need to do a better job accounting for and incorporating the technology that makes widespread information sharing possible. For a course he taught last fall, Gordon said that, with the help of a teaching fellow, he encouraged students to start a group Google document to share definitions and pose questions.“I thought that was a fabulous type of group work. It should be encouraged,” Gordon said. But, he added, “we’ve got to be attentive to how we design courses and how we deal with an evolving landscape of information.”Systematic biology professor Donald H. Pfister said that professors have become particularly mindful of collaboration policies in their own courses in the wake of the scandal.“I think everybody that I know is trying to be as explicit as they can be about expectations about how [students] work with other students,” said Pfister, the one-time chair of the Committee to Review the Administrative Board, which convened from 2007 to 2009.“I think it’s the faculty’s role to set out expectations, and that includes how students anticipate being in a course,” said Pfister, who is teaching a Science of Living Systems Gen Ed course this spring. “Good syllabi, good outlines—that’s all part of the job of teaching.”Government and sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol said she assigns a take-home exam in her own United States and the World Gen Ed course, but has never had a problem with widespread cheating. She said she worries that the University’s handling of the case will cause faculty to lose sight of the value of collaboration as they tighten restrictions on group work.“We cannot discourage people from talking, no matter what we do,” Skocpol said. “Teamwork is often a good thing in learning, and I just feel like a vague thing launched out there was causing people to forget about the basics.”Rather, Skocpol said, faculty should redirect their attention to those basics—clear communication among students, teaching fellows, and faculty about course expectations and policies.“Vague statements that there is a general crisis are not effective in encouraging people in learn to be better,” she said.PRESSING RESET

If you're lucky enough to have a significant other to impress this Valentine's Day, or if you simply need a break from the back-to-school rush, consider checking out an exhibit at one of the many art galleries around Boston and Cambridge. The Arts Blog has found four local galleries that are open to the public and free, so they're the perfect way to spend an afternoon if you've just dropped your last pennies on an Ec 10 book.<!--more--><a href=""http://mobilia-gallery.com/exhibits/maggie-tennesen-2013/index.html"">Maggie Tennesen at Mobilia GalleryMaggie Tennesen's paintings are composed of straight lines and crosshatching in bold, complementary colors, with Asian symbols etched into the paint. Somewhat reminiscent of computer circuit boards or street maps, they inspire at once a sense of vibrant energy and inner peace. The gallery will be hosting a special reception with the artist on Saturday, February 16, from 3-5 p.m. On display until February 28; 358 Huron Avenue, Cambridge.<a href=""http://www.chaseyounggallery.com/index.html"">John Dempcy &amp; Alicia Tormey at Chase Young GalleryBoth John Dempcy and Alicia Tormey use lively colors to blend science and nature in their paintings. While Dempcy's abstract pieces, composed of concentric drops of paint, evoke images of wildflowers, seashells, or even cells under a microscope, the networks of color in Tormey's landscapes and floral paintings are reminiscent of the nerves or capillaries in the human body. On display until  February 24; 450 Harrison Avenue, No. 57, Boston.
<a href=""http://www.barbarakrakowgallery.com/visible-merge-exhibition-2013"">Visible Merge at Barbara Krakow GalleryThis exhibit features portraits by Frank Egloff and John Stezaker, both of whom combine multiple photographs in their pieces. Egloff's pieces use printers to overlay images on top of one another, producing a ghostly photo-negative effect, and Stezaker's disconcerting collages splice separate portraits into single images. On display until March 9; 10 Newbury Street, Boston.<a href=""http://www.gallery263.com/artist.php"">Winter Residency at Gallery 263Gallery 263's Artists-in-Residency program allows emerging local artists to use the gallery as a shared studio for a period of six weeks. The work produced by the artists during their term is then placed on display in the gallery for two more weeks. The current roster for the winter residency comprises three painters—Stephen Hamilton, Sirarpi Heghinian-Walzer, and Youngsheen Jhe—and photographer Pia Ward. On display from February 28 until March 9; 263 Pearl Street, Cambridge.

                        Around the Ivies
                    
</h2>
Though our Eli friends haven’t lacked for bad press in the past couple of years, I would like to open the spring term’s first edition of Around The Ivies with the, well, bad press currently coming out of New Haven.Last Friday night, Yale’s men’s basketball team traveled to Cambridge to take on its sworn enemies in Lavietes Pavilion and left predictably humbled. As Crimson fans reveled in the Bulldogs’ defeat, punctuated by Yale forward Nick Victor’s thunderous failure of a dunk attempt, I wondered what my compatriots at the Yale Daily News had to say about the affair.Not much of anything, as it turned out. The Yale Daily News produced one article for the basketball team’s two weekend games against Harvard and Dartmouth. The author of the article, Alex Eppler, did a fine job concisely capturing each of Yale’s faceplants over the weekend, but come on, YDN, you couldn’t get the guy a train ticket? Perhaps they’re onto something; eschewing coverage of “popular” sports like football and basketball, they will be better able to focus their pens on trendy, buzz-generating topics like yoga competitions or Ph.D. funding policy.This brings me to that curiosity of the Ivy League social media world that is @YDNsports, the Yale Daily News sports section’s Twitter account. Its live coverage of Friday night’s rivalry showdown between Harvard and Yale consisted of retweets of the Harvard Athletics, THC Sports, and Ivy Hoops Online Twitter feeds, all occurring in the final five minutes of regulation. I imagine the good people at the YDN were adhering to one of their two cardinal rules of basketball coverage: “we step up when it counts” or “what time is the game?""But the most thrilling moment of the week in @YDNsports was undoubtedly its performance on Feb. 5, when it officially went rogue. Astutely noting the lack of Tuesday midday Ivy sports activities, the P.R. wizard operating the account deemed it prudent to “live tweet [his or her] field trip to the Yale cogen plant.” For those of you who didn’t receive this month’s issue of Electrical and Thermal Energy Quarterly, a cogeneration, or “cogen,” plant is a power plant where electricity, heat, and steam hang out and save energy, or something. Inexplicably, the phrase “cogen plant” did not begin trending worldwide, despite the broad appeal of such a topic with all of @YDNsports’ 234 Twitter followers. I can assure you that the six current Crimson staff writers that proudly count themselves among the “Lucky 234” were riveted.
HARVARD V. CORNELLIt’s Tommy Amaker’s annual challenge: how to keep his players away from the sensual attractions of the Ithaca nightlife, most of all Kuma Charmers, the premier gentleman’s club in all of the Finger Lakes National Forest metropolitan area. There are even dark rumors of one Harvard team’s boozy late-night trip to the Women’s Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls. Ithaca, baby.Pick: HarvardDARTMOUTH V. COLUMBIAAccording to Ken Pomeroy’s college basketball rankings, which are based on Pythagorean expectation, Dartmouth is the 286th best team in Division I basketball, the worst in the Ivy League. Yet the Big Green has performed relatively not awful in conference play thus far, playing Harvard tough twice and defeating Yale by nine. I’m giving this one to the Lions, but don’t think I’ve forgotten you, Gabas Maldunas. Your delightful fragility at the free throw line helped preserve the Crimson’s undefeated Ivy record.Pick: DartmouthYALE V. PENNFor me, the most stunning moment of Harvard’s triumph over Yale on Friday was when I glanced at the game program and noticed that the Bulldogs featured a player named Armani Cotton on their roster. I guess it’s most likely that this was an intentional move on the part of his parents, but I choose to believe Mr. and Mrs. Cotton put their son’s christening in the hands of a random word generator and were blessed with a smooth, cosmopolitan-sounding name. Their other children, Minute Fertilizer and Stampede Moustache, were not nearly so fortunate.Pick: YaleBROWN V. PRINCETON

Somehow, someway, the Harvard men’s basketball team has made it through the first four games of its conference season unscathed.Despite facing late deficits in its first two contests against Dartmouth and nearly blowing large second-half leads in its subsequent games against Brown and Yale, the Crimson sits atop the league as it heads into its first conference road trip of the season this weekend.“The victories have been very encouraging and inspiring in a lot of ways,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It’s given us a lot of life, a lot of spirit to [be] in first place.... But we also have to remember the journey and the process that’s taken place thus far to be there and some of that has been very good and some things have been disappointing.”This weekend, no longer will the Crimson (12-6, 4-0 Ivy) be fortunate enough to face the Big Green, the league’s consistent bottom-dweller, nor will it be playing in the comforts of Lavietes Pavilion, where it has won 37 of its past 39 games.Instead, Harvard travels to New York to play talented yet inconsistent rivals Cornell (10-11, 2-2) and Columbia (9-9, 1-3).
“There’s no question that both teams are good and they’ve always played us very tough,” Amaker said.The trip will bring back positive memories for the Crimson’s upperclassmen, who clinched the program’s second Ivy title by sweeping those two teams in the season’s final weekend 11 months ago.But the Big Red’s Newman Arena and the Lions’ Levien Gymnasium both proved to be extremely challenging environments for a veteran team that went 26-4 during the regular season.Last year, Harvard squeaked out an overtime win over Columbia before edging the Big Red by four. Now, a far less experienced squad that has already lost more games than its predecessor is tasked with achieving the same result.“You’re never comfortable on the road [with a] hostile environment, the crowd going against you,” freshman point guard Siyani Chambers said. “The first time that you’re doing this, you’re really nervous, but you’re also really excited.”The Big Red will come first, highlighted by its long, athletic forwards, Errick Peck and 2011-2012 Ivy Rookie of the Year Shonn Miller.Peck missed all of last season due to injury but has slowly re-found the form that made him a breakout player as a sophomore. The forward had his best game of the year in Cornell’s most recent contest, scoring 20 points on eight-of-eight shooting from the field in a 71-69 road win over Penn.Miller leads the squad in scoring with 10.1 points per game, is third in the conference in rebounding (7.0 per game), and is second in blocks (1.6 per contest). Senior guard Johnathan Gray provides leadership in the backcourt as well as 9.3 points.“We have to make sure we get back in transition with all their guys because I think they’re pretty athletic on the perimeter as well,” Amaker said. “We have to see if we can keep them off the backboard...and [we need to] make them work on the defensive end. We’re hopeful that we can get them to expend some energy there.”On Saturday, the Crimson faces the Lions, who along with Harvard and Princeton were expected to compete for their first league title in 45 years. But Columbia has struggled in league play thus far and has been upset by the Big Red at home and the Quakers on the road.

The Harvard men’s basketball team withstood a late Cornell run on Friday night, hanging on for a 67-65 win in Ithaca, N.Y.The Crimson, which led by 21 with 16:55 left and 15 with 4:21 to go, failed to score the rest of the way, and the Big Red came within a single shot of handing Harvard its first Ivy League setback of the season.But Errick Peck’s three-point attempt at the buzzer bricked off the glass, and the Crimson held on for the two-point win.“We did some wonderful things, and it’s really disappointing to see how we let that lead get away from us and had to battle right there to the end,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.Friday’s contest marked the Crimson’s fifth straight conference win by 10 points or fewer and the third straight in which Harvard nearly coughed up a sizeable lead.
With the win, the Crimson (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) remains atop the Ancient Eight standings, a half game ahead of Princeton (11-8, 4-1). Every other team has at least three league losses.But Harvard did all it could in the final 4:21 to cede its position atop the conference standings.Harvard shot 0 of 3 from the field, 0 of 1 from the free throw line, and turned it over twice down the stretch. Cornell shot four of six during the same stretch, closing out the contest on a 13-0 run.“When the pressure turned up and the crowd got involved in it, we came unglued again,” Amaker said.Following a Christian Webster three-pointer with 4:21 remaining, Peck got the run started for the Big Red with a pair of free throws. Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers missed a step-back jumper on the other end, and sophomore Jonah Travis was whistled for a foul going for the rebound, sending the Big Red back to the line.Cornell’s Galal Cancer knocked down both free throws, and Amaker opted to take a timeout with 3:34 to play.Facing intense Big Red pressure, sophomore Wesley Saunders coughed it up near midcourt, and Cornell’s Shonn Miller cashed in a breakaway dunk to pull the Big Red within 10 for the first time since the first half.The Crimson got the ball to forward Steve Moundou-Missi on the other end, but the sophomore was rejected by Miller. Johnathan Gray collected the rebound and pushed it up the court, where he converted a layup to pull the Big Red within seven, 67-60, with 2:34 remaining.Miller came up with another steal, this time taking the ball from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, and Gray knocked down a triple from the left wing to make it a four-point game.Coming out of a timeout, the Crimson put the ball in the hands of Saunders, but strong Cornell defense forced a miss with the shot clock expiring.

The Harvard men’s hockey team (5-15-1, 3-12-0 ECAC) will look to break an eight-game losing streak on national television against No. 17 Dartmouth on Saturday night at the Bright Hockey Center, which is still on schedule despite the incoming snow storm.The Crimson’s last victory came in early January against Boston University, whom Harvard will play in the upcoming consolation game of the Beanpot tournament on Monday evening.Coming off a 4-1 loss at the hands of No. 5 Boston College in the opening round of the Beanpot, Harvard will briefly resume league play against the Big Green (11-8-3, 7-6-2 ECAC), which started Harvard’s lengthy losing streak with a 3-2 defeat of the Crimson at the Thompson Arena in Hanover, N.H several weeks ago.""I think we're at a spot with the group that we want to get rewarded with some victories,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It's been a tough stretch, but the attitude of the group has been positive. The work ethic is good. We are making some improvements, [and] there are certainly some things we can do better. We're working on those.”Dartmouth’s strong season so far has come as bit of a surprise, with the Big Green slotted at seventh and tenth in the pre-season ECAC Coaches’ and Media poll, respectively. With wins over Yale, Union, Vermont, and New Hampshire, Dartmouth reached the top ten in national rankings earlier this year.
Led by sophomore Tyler Sikura and junior Matt Linblad, who lead the team with 26 and 23 points respectively, the Big Green will look to sweep the season series and move up in the ECAC standings, where it currently sits in third place ahead of the last-place Crimson.Harvard has not finished in last place in recent memory, and at least up through the last 50 years of its league play.""It's definitely been difficult, we've faced a lot of adversity,” captain Danny Biega said. “It takes its toll as losses add up. We're all sticking with it and showing up to the rink with a good attitude. No one is feeling bad for us, we just got to dig ourselves out of this hole we're in right now. I really think we're making good steps and strides towards doing that.""Leading the Crimson as it counters Dartmouth, which has only one road win on the season, will be freshman Jimmy Vesey. The Harvard forward is first on the team with 10 goals and 14 assists, was recently named the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Week for the third time, and is second in the nation among first-years with a 0.56 goals-per-game average.The freshman was also recently selected as a semifinalist for the Walter Brown award. The oldest nationally recognized college hockey honor, this award is presented to the best American-born college hockey player in New England.Despite the difficulties the Crimson has faced so far this season, junior goalie Raphael Girard has been able to rack up saves and is now just six shy of 600. He had a 42-save performance against the Eagles last Monday, two shy of his season high.In the last couple of years, the Beanpot has been somewhat of a jumping off point for Harvard into the final stretch of the regular season and playoffs. The team will look to replicate this trend this season as well.In the 2010-2011 campaign, the Crimson, after a poor start to the season, scored two late goals to overcome the then-No. 15 Terriers. Harvard went on to win seven of its next eight games before falling to Dartmouth in ECAC quarterfinals. Last year, the Crimson defeated Northeastern, 3-2, in the consolation game and then continued its momentum into the ECAC finals.This year's consolation match will again be against current-No. 13 BU, which lost to the Huskies, 3-2, in the semifinals of the Beanpot and has struggled since its collapse to Harvard at home, where it gave up a three-goal third period lead to eventually lose in overtime. Since the loss at the hands of the Crimson, the Terriers have gone 2-4-1.BU’s leading goal scorer is senior Wade Megan, who has 12, while sophomore Cason Hohmann and freshman Danny O’Regan—brother of Crimson sophomore Tommy—lead the team in total scoring with 23 and 22 points, respectively.“The Beanpot consolation game, it's never a fun game to play in, but it can be a little bit of a springboard for the stretch run,” Donato said. “We're going to be playing a very good BU team, so that can give us some confidence moving forward.""--Staff writer David A.

Saturday marked the third annual Ivy League Chinese Spring Festival Gala, hosted by the Harvard Chinese Students and Scholars Association to commemorate the traditional Chinese New Year. The event, however, was anything but traditional. Featuring acts ranging from a hip-hop interpretive dance to Chinese folk music to a Hungarian singer’s take of “Toreador Song” from the opera “Carmen,” the Gala didn’t focus, as might be expected, on the Year of the Snake. Instead, says HCSSA President Xu Zhang, a research assistant in SEAS, the Gala was meant as a celebration for a diverse group of students and attendees, many of whom are living far from home. “The main idea is to make [the student performers and spectators] feel at home while studying overseas, to gather together and celebrate with family and friends,” Zhang says.As audience members poured into Sanders Theatre, the excitement in the air was palpable, as the Gala itself marked the beginning of the holiday festivities. “I think Chinese New Year is like the U.S. Christmas,” says Wen Xie, a student in the School of Public Health and choreographer and dancer for the Student Dance Club at HSPH. “People get together and watch a really huge gala that happens in Beijing every Chinese New Year Eve. I think it’s very hard to recreate this scene in the U.S., since we don’t have any relatives around us, so friends are the ones we want to go to this festival,” Xie said.The Student Dance Club performed an original dance, “Love in the Source of the Yangtze River.” As the choreographer, Xie’s hope was to convey a universal feeling, love, through a distinctly Chinese narrative. “I’m going to tell a story about a Tibetan lover who falls in love with a boy at the end of the Yangtze River. [They’re] over a thousand miles apart, but it’s the same river they’re looking at every day,” she said. Her dance featured costumes of  her own design, and the twirls of the dancers mimicked both the running river and a Buddhist tower.Xie, who began dancing at the age of five, says she is eager to share her passion for choreographing and dancing, but the HSPH Dance Club is not limited to experienced dancers or even Chinese students. According to Xie, many of the dancers were first-time performers, and two members of the group are American students. For her, the experience is more about making friends and giving back to the community. “Everybody actually gets a lot of [joy] from the experience during our group dance, and we feel like after the Spring Festival Gala our group is more unified,” she says.The Gala also reaches beyond the Harvard student body. To create a greater sense of cultural unity among Chinese students studying in the United States, the HCSSA has reached out to its sister organizations at other Ivy League schools. “Harvard hosts the event each year, but the other organizations recommend different programs,” Zhang says. “Everyone is sacrificing time for study to do this entirely for the community,” she adds. “We feel like we have a responsibility to plan to gather together.”
Even for the students who prepared solo performances, the theme of unity and celebrating with family is paramount. “Usually people get together to celebrate this festival, but now I am away from my family, so the Gala is kind of a gathering together of all Chinese students,” says GSAS student Jingyi Yu. Yu presented an original magic show, “A Musical Dream,” featuring a series of CDs that she made disappear to the beat of popular American songs. “This performance doesn’t include much about Chinese culture, but I prepared it specifically for Chinese New Year,” she says.  “Chinese New Year is the most important and most traditional day in my culture, so that’s why I spent a long time preparing this performance.”The emcees, bedecked in dazzling formal dresses and dapper tuxedos, performed most of their introductions in Chinese. Many of the acts celebrated overcoming the language barrier through an international dedication to the arts. Violinist Julia L. Glenn ’11-’12 showed her knowledge of Chinese as she introduced her violin act. Later, Hungarian opera singer Attila Dobak wowed with his skill in singing French opera, but was met by applause when he sang a humorous Chinese duet concerning traditional wedding vows. Hui Weng needed no language at all to reach the audience with the haunting melodies of her instrument, a stringed zither used in traditional Chinese music.“I feel it is very important to glorify our Chinese culture in some way, especially in the Chinese community,” says Xie. The Gala not only drew attendees from the Chinese community, but also attracted a diverse audience in an international celebration. Whether understood in Chinese or in English, and whether viewed with friends or with family, the Ivy League Spring Festival Gala marked the beginning of the new year and the strengthening of new bonds.—Staff writer Devony B.

Kaia Stern, a lecturer at Harvard Divinity School, called the Harvard Interfaith Prison Education program an invaluable step towards fixing a prison system in “crisis” at the program’s official kick-off event Thursday evening.HIPE, which was founded in November through a partnership between the Harvard Episcopalians and Harvard Hillel, pairs mentors with incarcerated individuals working towards their Bachelor’s Degrees at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Norfolk.Stern, co-founder and director of the Prison Studies Project, first began  interest in America’s penal system began in college, and she has been involved in educating inmates ever since. Speaking to HIPE’s volunteers at Hillel on Thursday, Stern, who is also an ordained interfaith minister, shared her personal experiences witnessing the many opportunities and challenges faced by prisoners.Stern spoke about mass overcrowding and longer imprisonment sentences due to increased commercialization and profit-seeking within the prison system. The issues she touched on, said Harvard’s Episcopal Chaplain Reverend Luther Zeigler, will help HIPE become “sensitive to the overall context” within which it will work.“While a huge part of this project is building relationships with incarcerated individuals and mentoring them as they pursue their bachelor’s degree, you can add different components such as educating people outside of the program [and] educating ourselves about the prison system in America,” said HIPE co-founder and Divinity School graduate Hilly Haber.
HIPE’s 21 members come from across the University, including the College, the Graduate School of Education, Hillel, the Episcopal Chaplaincy, the Divinity School, the School of Public Health, and the Law School. And unlike other education programs, HIPE emphasizes its interfaith platform.“There is a theological dimension to what we are doing,” said Zeigler. “We are not only trying to be mentors and friends to these prisoners, but to understand that relationship in the context of our own religious traditions.”—Staff writer Zohra D.

February 14-16, 8 p.m.Written by Mark RavenhillDirected by Joshua McTaggart '13Produced by Simon De Carvalho '14 and David Manella '14“pool (no water)” is an unconventional drama that is meant to be slightly different each time it is performed. Opening in Adams Pool Theater on Thursday and directed by Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts editor, “pool (no water)” is not told as a linear narrative but through the recollections of the actors as they act out past events.
The story blurs the line between past and present as the actors narrate the breakup of five artists after one actor becomes famous and invites her four colleagues to her enormous home. The climax of the plot centers around an empty swimming pool, which makes the Adams Pool Theatre the perfect venue.“It’s unlike a lot of scripted shows in that it pushes the actors and the director to make a majority of the decisions,” actor Alistair A. Debling ’16 says. Though there are five characters, there are only four actors in the cast. The fifth character is created through description and referenced by the other actors; the very existence of this fifth person is dependent on the actors themselves. “There aren’t even stage directions—essentially it reads just like a piece of narration of a story,” said Debling.The play is written as a long piece of text which leaves much of the interpretation to the director and actors; it is at their discretion to divide the block of text into individual lines for each actor. For McTaggart, this play is different from the previous productions he has directed; this show is meant to change with each new cast that performs it. “This piece is written as an ensemble piece…what I’m really trying to encourage and foster in this.... is letting [the actors] play and then I kind of jump in and fix,” said McTaggart.According to actor John L. Pizzato ’16, “pool (no water)” is not about the story. “What really it’s about is these four artists remembering this information, remembering this story, processing it, and kind of transforming it into an art piece in real time for the audience as they’re performing it.”—Staff writer Bryan S.

Ninety-four years after women won the right to vote, 64 years after being formally allowed in the armed forces, and 16 years after the release of GI Jane, women can finally fight on the front line of battle. It is a truly historic occasion.The <a href=""http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=5183"">announcement came at a press conference on Thursday, January 24. Pentagon Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin E. Dempsey formally rescinded the 1994 ban on women serving in combat roles in the military.As far as contemporary civil liberties go, it is one thing to fight for free birth control, unisex bathrooms, or genderless pronouns. However, it’s an entirely different ballgame to fight for the right to live in a muddy hole while being shot at. There is no ulterior motive to be employed in the world’s most dangerous profession. The right to fight on the front line is a right won completely without pretense; it is a right to protect America and the freedom it represents.It is important to note those who opposed the inclusion of women on the front line are not all curmudgeonly Archie Bunkers in uniform. These are people genuinely concerned with the safety of the troops.  Sure, their reasons can be occasionally misguided and even misogynistic (re: all that <a href=""http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/menstruating-women-do-not-attract-bear-attacks"">drivel about menstruation and bears). Some are concerned about romantic relationships and the heightened risks of rape. However, both risks must be viewed in perspective. It takes a somewhat dubious stretch of the imagination to imagine seriously disruptive trench gossip about who likes whom when people's lives are at stake. Moreover, women who enter the military at all know there is a higher risk of rape just as they know there is a higher risk of combat-related death by being in a combat zone. There is also a higher chance of harassment, but women should not be punished for it.Yet most arguments about why women should not be on the front line were ruled out 64 years ago when women were allowed in the armed forces at all. All arguments made about the physical capabilities of women are irrelevant because women will still have to pass the same physical standards. The front line is the most dangerous position one can take. The inclusion of women does not come as a courtesy. There is no mulligan in the military. There are no handicaps or chivalry when the stakes are life and death.
However, it is important to note, the admission of women to the front line comes a little late. The term “front line” is somewhat past its prime, and women have already been fighting on it for many years. In modern warfare, threats are ubiquitous. The use of biological and cyber terrorism facilitates remote attacks. The “front line” is not necessarily in “front,” nor a “line,” nor “ontli,” for that matter. Though I suppose, “combat orbs” probably didn’t get far in Defense Department meetings.Subsequently, women have been fighting on the front line for years. John McCain, who publicly acknowledged his support of Panetta’s decision, <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/24/panetta-opens-combat-roles-to-women/"">noted, “The fact is that American women are already serving in harm's way today all over the world and in every branch of our armed forces… Many have made the ultimate sacrifice, and our nation owes them a deep debt of gratitude.”As far as we’ve come, there are still many places to go. Secretary Panetta, in addition to repealing the ban on combat, <a href=""http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=5183"">stated, “we are moving forward with a plan to eliminate all unnecessary gender-based barriers to service.” Women are still barred from elite Special Operations, including the Navy SEALS, Army Rangers, Delta Force, and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment.Moreover, 80 percent of generals have served in front-line combat. Clearly, experience on the front line is important for leadership. It is harder to follow orders when there is doubt that the person giving them has not experienced firsthand what those orders might entail. Opening up the front line can move women up the chain of command.Women make up only 14 percent of the 1.4 million American military personnel. However, it is not the percent but the principle that counts. Each and every woman has the right to work, though many choose to stay home.As a woman who plans to join the Navy after graduation, I am proud of the Secretary’s decision. It’s a milestone for the extension of civil liberties. In the words of the president, “valor knows no gender.”Sarah R. Siskind ’14 is a government concentrator in Adams House.

How far do you agree with this statement?"" please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday, February 13 at 6 p.m.  Diversification Is Not Always a Sign of Progress
To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army.However, I still find myself uncomfortable with the prospect of actively supporting this decision for a few reasons. First, it does not address some of the fundamental, underlying issues that make equality within the military impossible. For instance, sexual assault happens in the U.S. military at <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/27/military-sexual-assaults_n_2370099.html"">overwhelming rates, and effective measures are not being taken to address this situation. Gender equality is entirely impossible if members of certain genders are living in fear of violence from members of other genders.Secondly, no one should be fighting on the front lines. Let me be clear: I am not faulting soldiers for choosing to be soldiers. Many factors go into making such a decision, and joining the army is essentially the only option for some. I am instead faulting the U.S. military itself for existing, or at least existing in a capacity that involves sending people into combat.The U.S. military is an inherently imperialistic entity. It does not exist, and has long not existed, for defense. The last war fought on U.S. soil against an invading army took place in 1812, and since then the U.S. has been dispatching its troops to every corner of the globe, fighting wars for selfish reasons that usually boil down to a hatred of communism or a desire for oil. Does a fight for equality within such an institution really have meaning?Essentially, as long as we maintain a definition of progress that limits itself to diversification—which often consists of the diversification of oppressive institutions—we lose sight of the real benchmark of progress: the elimination of the institutions that cause oppression in the first place.Reed E.

Steven Soderbergh claims to be done—at least for the foreseeable future. At age 50, the prolific, protean director is tired of film, taking a hiatus to focus on painting. This choice is but one of many surprise turns in Soderbergh’s career; since he broke through with 1989’s “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” his eclectic catalog has ranged from the bleak “Contagion” and “Che” to the groovy “Magic Mike” and “Ocean’s Eleven.” His new—and potentially final—release, “Side Effects,” falls in the former camp, and while it is no monumental last hurrah, the film is a riveting mélange of some of the strongest Soderbergh staples: stylish direction, a star-studded, committed cast, and a thought-provoking story with more twists than the director’s own career.Emily (Rooney Mara) is a young, independent New Yorker whose husband Martin (Channing Tatum) has just finished a prison sentence. It soon becomes clear, though, that their relationship lacks its former spark, and that Emily in particular feels this absence.Mara drains her eyes of life as she did in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo;” however, in portraying Emily, Mara has removed Lisbeth’s fiery spunk. Her Emily seems almost dead, yet alive enough to still suffer, and Emily’s melancholia is magnified by the contrast against Tatum’s Martin. Tatum is all swagger here, and the shallowness of his character is intentional; Soderbergh avoids his debonair, heartbreaking smile like the plague. The director casts Martin in shadow and takes every opportunity to zero the camera in on the ghostly, broken Emily.Enter Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who is as put-together as Emily is in shambles. After surviving a not-so-accidental car crash, Emily begins therapy sessions with Dr. Banks, who, as the modern therapist is wont to do, prescribes her pills, first basic varieties and then, after fervent pleading from Emily, a new, experimental drug called “Ablixa.” For just a second, color returns to Emily’s face; Mara expertly injects bits of warmth into the character as she briefly comes back to the land of the living.Of course, the titular effects have to kick in sometime, and they do so within the first hour of the film: Emily vomits at work, things become fuzzy, and Martin awakes to a sleepwalking Emily blasting rock music and pouring glasses of milk. Ultimately, tragedy strikes. Banks is forced into the spotlight as his credibility as a psychiatrist is challenged, and he starts to grow paranoid and suspect conspiracy. Law, who for the first third of the movie sticks to his usual British charm, is convincingly shaken as his character’s stressors—and beard—grow and his solid exterior starts to dissolve.
The film could have been a simple—albeit gripping—chart of Emily’s fall and the subsequent descent of Banks. But this is a Soderbergh film, in which things cannot simply be how they appear. Just as Soderbergh peppers the movie with upside-down establishing shots, so does “Side Effects” flip its own established order on its head, partially thanks to the enigmatic Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones, here a dynamo of seductive energy barely contained by thick-rimmed glasses and done-up hair). The final revelation, though completely unexpected, might strike some as cliché or absurd, but it effectively sets up an ending in which not even the most heroic character is left with clean hands.“Side Effects” constantly engages, even in its long stretches of pure dialogue—Scott Z. Burns’s script moves remarkably fast for its abundant exposition—as well as lengthy periods of silence. The film lightly comments on Americans’ medication dependency; one of the film’s few moments of humor features a patient signing without reading the contract for an experimental treatment, lured by the promise of free pills. A more prominent success, though, is the way it taps into the fear of that dependency, ultimately using this fear to build up audience assumptions before yanking them all away. “Side Effects” may be more about thrill than social critique, but it feels timely and relevant nonetheless.While the film doesn’t necessarily rise above the rest of his work, Soderbergh is still ending this phase of his career on a high note. Indeed, there wasn’t really a way this film could have felt like an epic finale; it lacks the deep, colorful casts and grandeur of some of his previous work. Soderbergh’s tightly crafted last film, though, still manages to pack his strengths into an effective little thriller, a small creation with powerful effects.—Staff writer Tree A.

If meteorologists are correct, this weekend’s forecasted superstorm could potentially blanket Harvard Yard with more than two feet of snow, and in one blustery white swoop, Cambridge would receive roughly half of its average annual snowfall.The likelihood of such heavy snow, along with projections of strong winds and low visibility, have prompted the University to cancel all classes beginning at or after 12 p.m. Friday.All non-residential University facilities, including libraries, will also close at noon in deference to what the National Weather Service called a “potential historic winter storm” in a blizzard warning it issued.“This is not an everyday occurrence by any stretch of the imagination,” said Alan E. Dunham, a meteorologist with the Weather Service’s Taunton, Mass., office. “I can’t rememeber seeing us issue a snowfall forecast for this much accumulation for so much of the state.”Dunham said the Weather Service anticipates that light snow will begin falling Friday morning and intensify in the afternoon and then evening hours, before blizzard and whiteout conditions prevail overnight.

By Saturday evening, he said, widespread totals could reach more than two feet—and as high as 30 inches in some places.Dunham said that with high winds and costal flooding also expected, he would not be surprised by widespread power outages across the region.Overnight temperatures could dip as low as seven degrees Fahrenheit on Saturday night.Harvard Campus Services, which is responsible for facilities upkeep and snow removal, spent Thursday prepping equipment and buildings for the storm, according to Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin.He wrote in an email that snow-response teams will be “fully-staffed and on-campus for the duration of the storm.”The storm has already led to a host of cancellations on- and off-campus, with area universities and Harvard organizations readjusting their weekend schedules.The City of Cambridge will close Friday at 11 a.m. and Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 has ordered the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to suspend T service by 3 p.m.Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which usually closes each day between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., will keep its doors open all day Friday and Saturday, according the shelter’s administrative director Charles A. Hobbs IV ’13.Many varsity sports competitions scheduled for this weekend have been either cancelled or postponed.In addition, the first-year social committee announced Wednesday that it would postpone the annual freshman formal, which was previously scheduled for Friday night.The storm is already drawing comparisons to the blizzard of February 1978, the last time Harvard cancelled a full day of classes due to snow.That storm dropped 27.1 inches of snow, trailing only a 27.6-inch snowfall in 2003, the Boston record for a single storm.—Staff writer Nicholas P.

Watching too much television can lower a man’s sperm count by up to 44 percent, according to a recent study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health.Published Monday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the study also found that otherwise healthy young men who do not exercise have significantly lower sperm counts than men who do exercise.Researchers at HSPH analyzed the semen quality of 189 college-aged men and recorded data about their average physical activity and TV viewing patterns.“When we analyzed the data, we found that men who watched more than 20 hours per week had 44 percent lower sperm counts than those who watched almost no TV,” said Audrey J. Gaskins, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at HSPH. “Conversely, those who exercised the most at a moderate to vigorous rate had 73 percent higher sperm count than those who exercised less than five hours per week.”Previous studies have found that male sperm counts have declined in western countries over the last 60 years, but none have yet identified such a direct link between sperm count and physical habits.
“So much of the research that has been done in this area has been related to environmental chemicals. What chemicals have been introduced into the environment in the last 60-year period that may be the reason behind the decreasing sperm counts?” said Jorge E. Chavarro, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of nutrition and epidemiology at HSPH.  “But something that has not received as much attention is whether lifestyle factors such as diet, where people live, [and] how people move around might have also influenced these declines in sperm counts.”Gaskins added that previous investigations did not target the average population.“The majority of them have focused on professional athletes like marathon runners and elite cyclists. They generally reach activity levels that most people in the world can’t match,” she said. “So we set out to look at this question in a population of men that is somewhat more relevant to the population.”The mechanism by which a more sedentary lifestyle diminishes sperm is not yet fully understood, researchers said. But Gaskins offered some potential explanations.“Sedentary behavior has been linked to increased levels of oxidative stress, and oxidative stress can damage male germ cells...responsible for producing sperm,” she said. “There’s also the rationale that sedentary conditions have been linked to increased sperm temperature, and spermatogenesis is a temperature-dependent process.”—Staff writer Rachel J.

As its fifth and final application deadline nears, Teach for America is pushing for applicants from the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields—a group of disciplines known collectively as STEM.On Thursday night, a little more than a week before its Feb. 15 deadline, Teach for America executives assembled a group of STEM undergraduates from Harvard and other colleges in the Northeast and spoke to them about the current “crisis” in the American education system—namely, the poor quality of math and science education.“If we don’t have a workforce skilled in math and science, the country and the economy will be in trouble,” Executive Director of TFA in Massachusetts Josh Biber told the crowd.According to a projection from a recent Georgetown study, the number of STEM jobs in the U.S. will grow to eight million by 2018.But, as Biber was quick to point out, the American education system may be failing to meet the demand for skilled workers.
Biber discussed his experience teaching in Phoenix and his shock at discovering that his 10-year-old students had never taken a science class. He said that he took it upon himself to introduce his students to science.“Despite myself and my perceived disinterest in all things science, I said, ‘Someone has to teach them science,’” Biber said.Cambridge Mayor Henrietta Davis also spoke at the event, stressing that improving math and science education was a priority in Cambridge as well as the rest of the nation.“We’re not that different from any place else in the country,” Davis said. “We have the most privileged children—children of Nobel Prize winners—but we also have the poorest children—children of immigrants.”According to Melissa Moritz, an MIT graduate and the Head of TFA’s STEM Initiative, school districts continue to ask for more STEM teachers. But despite the high demand, teachers from the quantitative fields are in particularly low supply.“STEM teachers are the hardest to recruit because they have so many options right after graduation,” Moritz said.Of Teach for America’s 10,000 corps members, one-third teach math and science at the secondary level. Another third teach math and science at the elementary level.The bio-tech firm Amgen hosted the event at its research and development site in Kendall Square. Every year since 2006, Amgen has funded 100 fellowships to TFA STEM teachers, who receive signing bonuses as well as funds to buy classroom supplies.Davis urged the undergraduates present to pursue teaching careers in STEM fields, adding that Cambridge and the rest of country had much work to do in improving STEM education.“You’re the answer to the dreams of no less than the White House,” Davis said to the audience.—Staff writer Sonali Y. Salgado can be reached at ssalgado@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/SonaliSalgado16"">@SonaliSalgado16.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 13, 2013An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that bio-tech firm Amgen has funded 100 fellowships to TFA STEM teachers in the past seven years. In fact, Amgen has funded 100 of these fellowships in each year since 2006.

Remember when you still thought you’d be president someday? I sure do. Perhaps the single greatest privilege slipped in the envelope with each Harvard acceptance letter is the right to keep dreaming of being special for a few more years than most before succumbing to the pressure to settle for normality.I’ll restrict myself to telling the evolution of one particular species of Harvard freshman, the politico, since that is what I know best from personal experience.You arrive as a wide-eyed freshman, thinking there’s nothing you’d rather do with your life than politics. Your acceptance has confirmed to you that you were endowed at birth with intelligence of world-historical consequence. “Remember me when you run the country,” your friends and family tell you before you leave home. Almost all the Harvard grads you’ve heard of (if you had a normal adolescence and had the good fortune not to go to an elite Northeastern boarding school where everyone goes to the Ivy League) went on to be powerful and famous, so there’s no doubt that you will as well. You have yet to grasp the startling fact that there are tens of thousands of no-name Harvard grads out there somewhere, quietly plugging away in careers that will never be newsworthy. Political paralysis is nothing; Washington will regain animation based on the sheer force of your arguments. Senator [insert last name here] sure sounds nice, doesn’t it?The first few months on campus put some major dents in your ego. It’s likely your first time meeting people your own age as smart as or (gasp) smarter than yourself. It stings a little. Those dreams of future importance begin to deflate. You can’t all be president.A year or two later, the sirens of the exclusive and lucrative banking and consulting worlds begin to call. Everyone who showed up freshman year wanting to change the world is now chasing money, your classmates complain. But money is power in the real world, and going into politics or “public service” immediately after college with no real skills is a waste of time, others respond. As a recruiter from a major consulting firm put it last fall, “If you want to save the world, don’t go file papers for some non-profit. Learn how to do things.” But you also wonder if anyone persuaded by these arguments actually remembers to try to change the world later in life.
Jadedness sets in. Politics now seems so hard, and for what? Harvard students are risk-averse and idealistic above almost all else, and politics is nothing if not risky and cynical. Oil and water. Your continued employment is based on the whims of a fickle and distracted electorate and on your fealty to the party and donors who fund your campaigns. If you’re in national office, your hopes of making real change are endlessly thwarted by gridlock and polarization. Who wants to make the sacrifice to become a politician only to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/olympia-snowe-why-im-leaving-the-senate/2012/03/01/gIQApGYZlR_story.html"">resign in exasperation over Washington’s dysfunction?David Brooks <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/opinion/brooks-why-we-love-politics.html?_r=2&amp;"">used the movie “Lincoln” as a springboard to argue that despite all its warts, politics is still the best game in town for those who want to change the world for the better.But the Washington defined by the “marriage of high vision and low cunning” that Brooks lauds doesn’t exist anymore. Today’s 24/7 news cycle would instantly sniff out the dubious tactics used by Abe Lincoln to wrangle together support for the 13th Amendment. The alternative to political shenanigans is (God forbid) public support for smart policies, but that’s a nonstarter for now.Brooks calls politics noble, but the only memorable instance of nobility in American politics in the last decade was the volley of courageous votes for Obamacare cast by politicians (like my own Senator Ben Nelson, who was <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0110/31488.html"">heckled out of an Omaha restaurant when dining with his wife following his vote) who knew a yes vote would likely mean the end of their political careers but were willing to sacrifice themselves for a cause—expanded access to health care—that they believed to be larger than themselves.After this long evolution to disenchantment, only about <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/25/graduates-senior-survey-2012/"">one percent of Harvard students end up going into politics after graduation. They are one of the great enigmas of this college. I can’t tell whether they are drawn by blind hope, selfish ambition, a sense of purpose, or something else entirely. Whatever it is, they are some of the rare few here who defy the seemingly inexorable pull towards the stable, well-trodden path.But maybe Brooks is right. Maybe the Lincolns of history and Harvard are those who, despite all of these well-founded concerns, stubbornly plunge headlong into the jungle of politics out of a desire to make a real difference in the world. At this moment and in this country, that idea seems sadly naïve. But at least they get to keep dreaming.Wyatt N. Troia ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is an economics concentrator in Winthrop House.

A new installation at the Lamont Woodberry Poetry Room commemorates a time in Cambridge history when one could dial ‘617-492-1144’ and hear anyone from Allen Ginsberg to the Pope read a poem out loud.A gathering on Thursday kicked off the spring 2013 season at the Woodberry Poetry Room, whose new gallery features archived recordings and other paraphernalia from the “Phone-A-Poem” service that operated out of Cambridge for 25 years from 1976 to 2001. Visitors can sit down and hear, in addition to the beats and the beatified, Donald Hall ’51, Jane Kenyon, Ifeanyi Menkiti, James Tate, and others. The “Phone-A-Poem” exhibit will be on display until May.“The idea was to liberate poems, take them out of books and libraries,” said Peter Payack, the Cambridge-based poet and writer who first conceived of the project in 1976. “I think some people would be intimidated to go to a poetry reading—I know I used to be. This way, it was like a conversation, and if you didn’t like the poem you could hang up.”The exhibit attests to the relative fame the project achieved. At one point, the project’s coordinators reached an agreement with Out of Town News to have poetry readings and bands perform on the roof, and a scrolling sign that wrapped around the stand displayed poems by local schoolchildren. One week, the service featured a recording from the Pope and received over 25,000 calls.“It seems hard to believe, but at the time all of this technology was completely novel,” said Christina Davis, the curator of the Poetry Room.
Payack and Roland F. Pease, a publisher who became involved in the project, sent out postcards to poets they liked. Each card contained just two checkboxes to indicate whether the poet wanted to be involved in the project or not.“If they said yes, I sent a cassette,” said Pease. “Almost everyone agreed.”GSAS art history student Camran J. Mani came across the poster for the event and attended on a whim. “I liked it,” said Mani. “It feels very intimate to hear [a poem] on the phone.”“Phone-A-Poem” eventually stopped in 2001, when it gradually became redundant because advent of the internet. The resources it had accumulated went to Emerson College, where it soon died out after a few years.“I wanted to put poetry out there for everyone to experience,” said Payack. “Now [the project] is here and I’m thrilled.”—Staff writer Yen H.

The Cambridge Historical Commission has ruled that a Harvard fence is too great a work of art to be adorned with more art.The Commission voted Thursday night to strike down a University proposal that would have affixed decorative panels to sections of the fence guarding entry to Harvard Yard in the Science Center Plaza.The roughly 15 Cambridge residents in attendence for the Commission’s vote voiced sharp opposition to Harvard’s plan, which Cantabridgian Francis E. Donovan ’59 called a “gross misuse of these sacred wrought-iron fences.”Officials in the Harvard University Planning Office had hoped to showcase colorful student artwork on the panels in an effort to foster a vibrant community atmosphere in the Science Center Plaza, which is currently being renovated as part of Harvard’s Common Spaces initiative.But the Commission members who voted down Harvard’s proposal at Thursday’s public hearing said that the plan violated the historical and artistic integrity of Harvard’s wrought-iron fences.
“The fence itself is a work of art that needs to be treated with as much respect as a building,” commission member Chandra Harrington said at the hearing.Cambridge residents in attendance echoed Harrington’s sentiment.“Nothing could be more incongruous than posting signboards on that fence,” Donovan said.Another Cambridge resident who spoke at the meeting, Marilee Myers, was more blunt. “You might as well hang a billboard around John Harvard’s neck,” she said.Harvard oficials had planned to display the four-by-five foot panels on the sections of the fence that run between Meyer and Holworthy Gates during the fall and spring semesters. They had intended to establish a committee, likely comprised of Harvard students and faculty, that would select the art to be displayed.The University was required to seek the approval of the Commission because the Harvard Yard Fence, like the Yard itself, is part of the Old Cambridge Historic District.The Commission’s final vote to table Harvard’s plan, 6-2-1, reflected the abstention of Jo M. Solet, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School.The vote did not close the door on an alternative University plan—which would fall outside of the Commission’s jurisdiction—to set up an exhibition of movable panels that would not directly touch the fence.Cantabridgian James Williamson, who was present at the meeting, criticized what he called insufficient community outreach conducted by the University Planning Office in regard to the plan.“Harvard missed an opportunity in not engaging its students and neighboring communities in the making of this project,” he said. “Hopefully the administration will learn for the future.”—Staff writer Matthew Q.

Emmy Award-winning actor Kiefer Sutherland defused a costumed bombshell Friday night while being roasted as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2013 Man of the Year.Sutherland, best known for his portrayal of counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer on the Fox television series “24,” was required to “disarm” a bombshell—a Pudding cast member clad in a blonde wig and minidress, strapped with three multicolored wires—to earn his traditional Pudding Pot.Sutherland was honored Friday in front of a packed audience in The Regattabar, a jazz club in The Charles Hotel. The festivities had originally been scheduled to take place in Farkas Hall, the home of the Pudding Theatricals, but it was relocated after Harvard shut down operations at noon on Friday due to Boston’s fifth biggest snowstorm on record.As the snow swirled outside, Sutherland disarmed the bombshell with the assistance of a variety of colorful characters, all played by Pudding actors, who instructed him which color wires to snip.First, he planted a kiss on Crimson business editor and Pudding cast member Adam J. Conner ’14, who played Cardinal Richelieu, the villain in Sutherland’s film “The Three Musketeers.”
Next, he helped his “The Three Musketeers” co-star Charlie Sheen, portrayed by Phil M. Gillen ’13, round up a pair of Pudding performers in garb as drugged cows.Finally, Sutherland, an avid guitar player and collector, played a riff on an electric guitar to win the help of the late rockstar Freddie Mercury of the band Queen, played by Pudding cast member Ethan D. Hardy ’14.When he succeeded in defusing the bombshell, Sutherland was presented with his award, though not before cast members donned him with high heels and a bomb-strapped bra.Pudding producers Tyler R. Lewis ’14 and Peter M. Riley ’14 began the roast by poking fun at a few of Sutherland’s early-career films, including “Mirrors” and “The Right Temptation,” which were widely panned by critics.Riley quipped, “[‘24’] marked the point in his career when our Man of the Year began disarming bombs rather than starring in them.”Sutherland took the jabs well. “I could have made more fun of myself than you did,” he said.Sutherland praised the Pudding, saying he was impressed with the performers he had met that day. “The people here have been so gracious, and I have so much respect for all of you to even get into this goddamn place,” he said.The Harvard Krokodiloes also performed for Sutherland after he received his award. Though Pudding members had intended to debut their 165th production “There’s Something About Maui” in Farkas Hall following the roast, they instead gave the crowd a preview in The Regattabar. They performed a few numbers from the show, wearing only the headpieces of their costumes.Sutherland's roast follows that of actress Marion Cotillard, who was <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/1/marion-cotillard-pudding-woman/"">honored on Jan. 31 as the 2013 Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year.—Staff writer Elizabeth S.

Unless you've been under a rock, you probably already know that HUDS and FMO workers basically saved the day today.<!--more-->Essentially, these people are heroes, and we couldn't have made it through Nemo without them. As of lunchtime on Saturday, some dining hall workers had been on campus helping feed students since early Friday morning. Similarly, Harvard Facilities Maintenance Operations staff worked night and day throughout the blizzard to keep pathways clear for us.Be sure to extend your thanks to FMO and HUDS if you haven't already done so. Here's our tribute to their extraordinary efforts to keep us safe and sated.

Let's be real, this is the most snow we're going to have for a while. So ditch your real to do list, bundle up, and head outside. We at Flyby have created your Snow Day itinerary.<!--more-->1. Sled down Widener Steps. We just might have enough snow that the steps will have turned into a perfect hill for sledding—almost as if we have a real hill here at Harvard. Side note: this is probably a bad idea. Be careful and, whatever you do, don't try and stop yourself halfway down…2. Sled down the ramp outside the Carpenter Center. Almost definitely off-limits, but oh-so-fun, and relatively safe at that.3. If you're stranded in the quad, try sledding down the small hills outside Cabot d-hall. You, too, will come to the sad realization that it turns out we have a pretty flat campus.
4. Trek off campus to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw3hfOalG8U"">Fresh Pond or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ah9aXAZljc"">Danehy Park in Cambridge, or head to <a href=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8330648990_80ab85803b_z.jpg"">Corey Hill Outlook in Brookline (admittedly a long haul on a day like today). Worth it, we promise.5. Get creative right here at home. Check out the seam tunnels. Really—there's no better day than today to explore the underground world of Harvard. We don't know where the entrances are, but if you do get in (and avoid the police chasing you), you'll be the warmest student on campus.6. Primal scream. Do it.7. Whatever you do, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/8/photo-contest-flyby-snow/"">we want to see it. Don't forget to tweet and Instagram your adventures using the hashtag #flybysnow!

The Steak + Eggs ($16.95) is the perfect option if you are looking to get protein into your body. The well-done steak, about the size of a small palm, is accompanied by two eggs of any style, home fries, and toasted English muffins with jam and butter.

The Harvard men’s basketball team had been there before.Just as it did in the waning minutes of its Ivy League contest against Dartmouth, the Crimson found itself down by double digits to an underdog opponent—this time Columbia—as the clock wound down in the second half. And just like in each of its four most recent league contests, Harvard was once again in need of late-game heroics.But this time, down 20 with 2:58 to go, a storybook comeback wasn’t in the cards.“We were certainly out of sync,” Amaker said. “We’ll take a look at the film and see where we went wrong. There were a lot of breakdowns in communication, and they took advantage of those.”Led by sophomore Wesley Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who each scored four points in the final 3:09, Harvard tallied seven straight points to cut Columbia’s lead to 75-62 with just under two minutes to play.
But it was too little, too late, as the Crimson (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) eventually suffered its first league defeat of the 2012-13 campaign, 78-63, at the hands of the Lions (10-10, 2-4) Sunday afternoon at Levien Gymnasium.“You’re never comfortable on the road,” Chambers had said before the game. “[It’s] a hostile environment, crowd going against you…. Your whole team needs to be together and play as a unit.”With 2:58 left to play in the contest, Columbia’s Alex Rosenberg knocked down two free throws to secure a sizable, 75-55 advantage for his team at the end of a seven-point scoring streak.From there, Saunders made a jumper off the glass at 2:35 and Chambers scored four points from the line to narrow the lead to 14.With 1:40 left to play in the contest, co-captain Christian Webster stole the ball, was fouled on the steal, and made one of his two free throws to cut the deficit to 13.But that was as close as the Crimson would get, as Harvard gave up three more free throws and scored just one more point—a shot from the stripe by freshman Agunwa Okolie—down the stretch.After a back-and-fourth first half that resulted in a four-point Lions’ advantage, the Crimson scored five straight points after falling behind by 10 at the start of the second frame. But Harvard would not get back within five for the remainder of the game.Columbia stretched its lead to 12 at 7:42 in the second after Rosenberg converted on a wide-open look from three, forcing Harvard to call a timeout and put on the full-court press.But it was to little avail. Columbia point guard Brian Barbour—who was held scoreless in the first half despite averaging 13 points per game on the season—came alive midway through the second frame, adding some much needed cushion to his team’s lead. Barbour—who closed out the contest with eight points and as many assists—finished a layup and a triple and dished out two assists in the subsequent two minutes, leaving his team with a solid 18-point lead at the five-minute mark.On the way to a career-high 27 points on 9-of-12 shooting, Lions’ guard Steve Frankoski put the icing on the 9-1 Columbia run with a mid-range jumper that put his team up, 68-50.

After 30 minutes of dominant play at Newman Arena, it seemed that the Harvard men’s basketball team could finally take a breath.But once again, last minute inconsistency almost handed the Crimson its first Ivy League loss as its lead began to slip away down the stretch. Although Harvard (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) pulled out a 67-65 win over Cornell (10-12, 2-3), the game came down to a deep missed shot at the buzzer that would have put the Big Red on top.With Harvard up by 20 midway though the second half, two straight turnovers and a Jonah Travis foul handed the Big Red the momentum, and Cornell held Harvard to only one score in the next four minutes.The Crimson fought back and built its lead back up to 15 but found itself shut out as time wound down. With 4:21 on the clock, co-captain and guard Christian Webster scored Harvard’s final points of the night, and from then on it was all Big Red.“We stopped working to get the ball,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Whether that’s fatigue or whatever it is, we didn’t work to get open… They turned up the pressure and since then we were a little tentative.”
As Harvard struggled to find the bottom of the net, Cornell—which shot 49 percent from the field on the night—made clutch baskets down the stretch. The Big Red scored on its next five possessions and pulled within two before time ran out.The Crimson was its own worst enemy down the stretch, committing seven turnovers in the last ten minutes and continuing its trend of playing into close games against Ivy League opponents. Of the five conference games Harvard has played this season, two have gone into overtime—most recently against Brown, when the Crimson blew a 22-point lead at Lavietes Pavilion last weekend.“It’s been something that’s happened to us, being a very young team,” Amaker said. “We came out [strong] at the beginning of the second half, and I thought we were growing up right there, but we reverted back.”THREE FOR ALLAfter posting a season-high 16 points against the Bears last weekend, Webster topped his record by one, sinking five threes and adding two points from the paint.Webster continued to show consistency from behind the arc when it mattered most, hitting back-to-back treys in the closing minutes of the second frame. The senior’s last minute heroics, which fueled Harvard’s comeback against Dartmouth in the team’s home opener, once again proved to be a deciding factor in the Crimson’s victory.Shooting 46 percent from behind the arc, Webster notched a new season high with the five treys and continued to solidify his reputation as one of Harvard’s strongest shooters.As Webster has heated up from behind the arc, the Crimson has relied less on its traditionally strong three point shooters—freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and junior co-captain and guard Laurent Rivard.Rivard—who leads the team with 2.8 made threes per game—went 1-for-3 from deep on Friday, while Chambers accounted for two of the team’s 10 threes. When asked if the shifting roles on the team were by design, Amaker explained that scouting is a large factor.“You can imagine how people are going to try to guard against Siyani and Laurent, so it’s going to be other guys who are going to be open for us,” Amaker said.

The Harvard men’s hockey team (5-15-2, 3-12-1 ECAC) snapped its losing streak in anticlimactic fashion Sunday evening, tying No. 17 Dartmouth (11-8-4, 7-6-3 ECAC), 1-1, at the Bright Hockey Center.With just over three minutes left in regulation, it looked like Harvard would skate away with its ninth straight loss.  Dartmouth senior Dustin Walsh appeared to give the Big Green a late 2-1 advantage as it looked as if he had put back a rebound from classmate and captain Mike Keenan. But officials waved off the goal as a video review tagged Keenan with crease interference.“We thought, seeing it on the replay and live, that their player interfered with our goalie’s ability to make the save to get across,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought they made the right call. I’m sure that the other side would see it a different way, but I thought our guys battled all game… It would have been unfortunate if that goal had counted.”The Crimson would force overtime. After five minutes of extra time, the conference rivals remained deadlocked at one. It was a fitting conclusion to an even 60 minutes of hockey over which neither squad managed to gain a solid upper hand.Defender Andy Simpson provided Dartmouth an early lead less than 10 minutes into the opening frame. A close-angle shot from the right wing slipped past the pads of junior Crimson goaltender Raphael Girard for the Big Green sophomore’s second goal of the season.
“I don’t think we started our best, but I think we built up through the second and third period,” senior forward Marshall Everson said. “I felt that at that time [of Dartmouth’s goal] we had more of the momentum… In the past we haven’t really dealt with those types of back-breaker goals so well, so it was tough to give up, but I was pretty proud of the way the guys battled back the rest of the game.”With less than nine minutes left in the second, Crimson co-captain Danny Biega drew a trip from Dartmouth freshman Connor Dempsey—brother of Harvard women’s hockey co-captain Jillian Dempsey—to earn Harvard’s third power play of the game.The Crimson had entered the match with an NCAA Div. I-worst 9.52-percent success rate (8-for-84) on the man advantage. This time, Harvard capitalized on its opportunity.More than a minute into the power play, Everson received a tape-to-tape centering pass from senior forward Alex Fallstrom and laced a close-range equalizer over the right shoulder of Dartmouth goaltender Cab Morris.“We won a battle in the corner, which is big. We haven’t been winning as many as we need to this year,” Everson said. “[Sophomore forward Colin] Blackwell made a good pass down to Fally, and Fally really made a patient play and found me in a nice area.”While Dartmouth threatened to strike in the closing minutes, Harvard also had its fair share of opportunities to seize the lead late.“We missed the net five or six times that really negated a couple of great scoring chances,” Donato said. “I thought a couple of our best chances never made it to the net, probably three or four in the third.”In the final frame of regulation, Dartmouth freshman defender Geoff Ferguson covered up the puck in the Big Green crease after a slap shot from Harvard junior blueliner Dan Ford bounced loose. Officials declined to award the Crimson a penalty shot.“Our guys thought he used his hand to cover the puck in the crease,” Donato said. “But the refs are down there, and it’s one of those things where there’s not much you can do about. We just wanted to keep playing.”In overtime, Dartmouth outshot Harvard, 3-0, but failed to break through. Girard finished with a game-high 26 saves on the night as the Big Green edged the Crimson in shots, 27-22.With the tie, Harvard picked up its first point in conference play since a 4-1 win over Cornell on Nov. 16. The last-place Crimson trails the 11th-place Big Red by three points in the ECAC standings with six games remaining in the regular season.Because of the weather postponement, Harvard now faces a quicker-than-expected turn around as it prepares to face Boston University in the Beanpot consolation game Monday evening.“We’re positive coming out of this game. It’s always fun to play BU, and it’s always a big moment if we can beat them,” said Everson, who will be competing in his last Beanpot game. “We [seniors] want to make an impression or at least go out on top as much as we can.”—Staff writer Michael D.

With its past success and talent on the roster, it’s not all that surprising when Harvard’s men’s squash steps up and performs outstandingly.Still, the No.3 Crimson continues to impress, as it rolled over No. 17 Brown in a 9-0 win in which all the Harvard players blanked their foes 3-0. The lopsided victory is Harvard’s fourth time sweeping its opponent in all nine matches this season.The Crimson (14-1, 5-1 Ivy), which met the Bears (7-9, 0-6 Ivy) on Thursday night at the Kate Brodsky Memorial Squash Pavilion in Providence, was playing in one of its last conference matchups of the year, with only rivals Yale left on the  regular season schedule.“We won in total 27 games and didn’t drop any,” junior Ali Farag said, “which is just a huge win for the team. I know that looking at our two teams we were the stronger team on paper, but no one cashed it in and everyone played really hard and competed to get the win.”The match was moved up to Thursday from Friday due to the snowstorm anticipated to rock the Northeast.
Three players from the Crimson squad reached 10 wins on the season. Junior Brandon McLaughlin was the fastest to the benchmark, and teammate Sam Goldberg and Tommy Mullaney soon followed suit.Goldberg has shined as one of a handful of freshmen to see extended playing time in the varsity lineup. Playing at the eighth position, he beat out Charles Lebovitz, 11-3, 11-5, 11-8, to become the first freshman to reach ten wins.“It feels good [getting ten wins],” Goldberg said. “It’s great to help out the team. I don’t care much about my personal record, what’s more important is that we’re all striving for the same goal and that I can contribute to the team.”McLaughlin, playing second singles, got there first after winning one of the more lopsided matches of the day against Oliver Booth, 11-3, 11-1, 11-3. Mullaney was the third player to hit 10, with a straight-game win in the six slot, 11-3, 11-4, 11-3, over Michael Snower.Farag and co-captain Jason Michas are both undefeated at 9-0 on the season. Farag, who has played at number one for most of the year and is the defending national champion, defeated Blake Reinson, 11-9, 11-8, 13-11, in one of the closer matches of the day to keep his unbeaten streak alive.  Michas won a hard-fought second game and cruised through a third to win against the Bears’ Michael Snower, 11-3, 13-11, 11-3.“It wasn’t our hardest match of the season,” Farag said, “but they still played very well and we had some hard matchups. But in the end we prepared well for them and we were ready for what they had in store.”Junior Nigel Koh, playing at the third position, cruised through the first two games before winning a hard-fought decider to beat out Brown’s Eamon O’Connor, 11-3, 11-4, 12-10. At the fifth spot co-captain Zeke Scherl defeated Christopher Holter 11-2, 11-6, 11-8.The team is looking forward towards its matchup next weekend against Yale, the last Ivy League match-play of the season. With national play still on the horizon, Harvard has the chance to grab a share of the Ivy title with a win against the Bulldogs.“Our co-captains [Scherl and Michas] came out in the huddle and told us to use this match as a tune-up and confidence-booster for Yale next weekend,” Goldberg said. “And we’re ready, you know. We’re ready for our next big challenge, which is going to be going up against our rivals this Sunday.”Farag echoed his teammate’s words.“The only match we lost this season in Ivy League play was against the Tigers,” Farag said. “But now we have the chance to come back and take a share of the Ivy League title. So we’re going into next weekend with this in mind; that we’re coming out to play for a piece of the Ivy League title.”The rest of the Harvard squad held up their end of the bargain, with players all pulling through for straight-set wins.Walker Evans, the other freshman in the lineup on the day, played at the ninth spot and won out against his opponent, Alexander Hsu, 11-7, 11-4, 11-7. Alexander Ma, playing at seven, defeated his opponent in a shootout despite fierce competition from Brown’s Tod Holberton. Every game came fairly close, but Ma was able to hold off Holberton to win 11-9, 11-7, 11-8.—Staff writer Alex L. Saich can be reached at asaich@college.harvard.edu.

In its second match of the day, sophomore heavyweight David Ng secured a victory for the Crimson over Princeton with a 4-1 win in the day’s final bout. Harvard clinched eight out of ten matches in a 27-6 win over the Tigers.It was a strong finish to a day that began poorly for the Crimson (4-5, 2-4 EIWA), which fell, 24-6, to Penn (7-3, 4-1 EIWA) in its first leg of Saturday’s dual meet.“Penn was a tough match for us—it was tough for the team,” co-captain Walter Peppelman said. “What happened at Penn was we lost the close matches. The score doesn’t show it, but we were really in that match, and we had many opportunities to win that match.”Freshman Jeffrey Ott opened the day’s bouts at 125 when he matched up against the Quakers’ No. 20 Mark Rappo, who topped Ott with a 6-3 decision.The Crimson had similar luck in the second bout at 133, with senior Shay Warren falling, 8-5.
Co-captain Steven Keith secured Harvard’s first win of the day. Keith defeated Penn’s No. 9 C.J. Cobb for the second time this season. The decision brought the score to 6-3 in favor of the Quakers.“Obviously Steven had a great, great performance against C.J. Cobb, who was ranked ninth in the country at that time,” Peppelman said.Harvard’s Peppelman snagged the second and final Crimson win over Penn at 157, a 6-0 shutout.Harvard lost the following five bouts, but allowed only a combined 10 points for the Quakers.“I just think things didn’t come together for us at Penn,” Peppelman said.Sophomore James Fox almost edged out No. 9 Micah Burak, leading Penn’s All-American in the second period, but Fox eventually fell to Burak, 6-3.“We lost a lot of close matches,” Keith said. “Their whole lineup is tough, but if we had taken a few of those close matches back with us, then I think we would’ve been right in there to beat them.”After falling to Penn, Harvard wrestling shifted its attention to the Tigers and rebounded with a resounding victory.“We were able to talk about [the loss] as a team,” Keith said. “We realized we didn’t perform our best against Penn, and, you know, we decided to come together to try to turn it around.”Ott opened the meet again, this time with a 9-3 decision over Princeton’s Max Rogers. The freshman’s win gave the Crimson needed momentum after the preceding loss to the Quakers.

Following the Harvard track and field team’s first meet of the indoor season a few weeks ago, coach Jason Saretsky predicted that the school record board would undergo “a pretty major facelift” in 2013. With their performances on Saturday, three members of the women’s team provided the scalpels.In the team’s most crucial meet to date, junior thrower and co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu, sophomore sprinter Danielle Barbian, and co-captain pole vaulter Sydnie Leroy broke Crimson records in their respective events. Ekechukwu’s performance was most impressive, as she also broke the Ivy League record by becoming the first woman in conference history to eclipse 20-meters in the weight throw.Despite these stellar individual outings, the Harvard women finished second at the annual HYP meet, which was held at Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium. The Princeton women took home the team title, tallying 79 points to Harvard’s 55. On the men’s side, the Tigers topped their rivals for the 22nd consecutive time, outscoring Harvard and Yale, 88-59-23, to earn first place.“Obviously, I’d like to come away from that meet with the two wins, but more important was the work we got in,” Saretsky said. “Throughout the season, we continue to rewrite the record books…. I think we’ve got some real momentum and some real excitement going into the [Heptagonals] in two weeks.”The women’s weight throw was perhaps the premier event of the weekend, as Ekechukwu battled Princeton’s highly touted freshman Julia Ratcliffe, who was expected to challenge Ekechukwu for Ivy supremacy. Ratcliffe, a native of New Zealand, currently holds the record for the weight throw in her home country (19.69 meters).
But it was Ekechukwu who ruled the day, throwing 20.03 meters on her first attempt and 20.11 on her third to break the record. Ratcliffe also turned in a personal-best performance by throwing 19.74 meters, but it was not enough to top the junior, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor.“[Ekechukwu] has been ready for this for a while now, so it was fantastic to see things finally click,” Saretsky said. “I still think there’s more to come [from her].”Barbian and classmate Ashley Collinsworth teamed up to take the top two spots in the 60-meter dash. Barbian, who already held the school record in the event, ran her personal-best time of 7.59 seconds. Collinsworth was hot on her teammate’s heels, finishing in 7.78 seconds to give Harvard eight total team points in the event.“About a quarter of the way through the race…it wasn’t going as well as I hoped,” Barbian said. “But I was able to make some adjustments and finish the race really well.”“I was happy [with my performance],” Barbian added. “It’s a confidence boost to see that I’ve been running pretty well, but there are still some things I can change before Ivy League Championships to hopefully run faster.”Leroy, the final Crimson record setter, tied for first place in the pole vault with Princeton’s Tory Worthen. Both women cleared every height up to 3.91 meters, the new Harvard record, but were unable to clear the bar at four meters.“She did a really great job of backing up the pre-meet talk that we had about really getting after it and leaving it all out there,” Saretsky said. “Just like with Adabelle, there’s even more to come [from her].Senior Mary Hirst also had a strong showing on Saturday, taking home the high jump with a clearance of 1.80 meters.On the men’s side, junior Maksim Korolev dominated the mile run, finishing in 4:05. The junior, who was recently named next season’s cross country captain, finished nearly four seconds ahead of the Tigers’ James Shirvell, who finished in second place. Crimson junior Ryan Romain and senior Sean Pohorence also placed in the event, coming in third and fourth place, respectively, to give Harvard eight team points.“Maks is in great shape,” Saretsky said of Korolev, who beat his personal record by six seconds. “He just went out there and kind of did his thing. It was fun.”The men’s throwers provided a preview of the impact they will have at this month’s Indoor Heptagonal Championships, finishing 1-2-3 in both the shot put and the weight throw. Junior Dustin Brode took home the top spot in the shot put with a heave of 17.41, with sophomores Ben Glauser and Igor Liokumovich rounding out the top three. Glauser took over in the weight throw, just missing the 18-meter mark by throwing 17.98 meters.“I think this meet definitely showed that we’re a force to be reckoned with,” Barbian said. “In other years, we’ve been content with taking third, or being in the top half [of the Ivy League], but this year, I think we’ve come in with this attitude that we can’t settle for anything less than first.”—Staff writer Dominic Martinez can be reached at dmartinez@college.harvard.edu.

Coming off a big win over No. 4 Trinity the night before, the No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team (11-1, 5-1 Ivy) picked up another win against a top-tier opponent. The Crimson took down No. 9 Brown (11-6, 1-5 Ivy) in a Thursday night contest at Brodsky Memorial Squash Pavilion.“We were really excited [about the win],” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “After coming off [the win against] Trinity, we were kind of on a high. We have just been keeping that momentum going.”The match was originally set for Friday but was moved up a day early due to inclement weather. The schedule meant that Harvard played matches on back-to-back nights, but fatigue seemed to be a non-factor in the Crimson’s 9-0 routing of the Bears.“Physically, we are a little run down, and mentally, you [have] to keep the fire going,” Kingshott said. “The season is really long. It’s back loaded with our Ivy matches now but we’ve been playing since September and have had matches since November. We want to stay focused.”It was back to business as usual for sophomore Amanda Sobhy, who won her match 3-0. The sophomore entered Thursday’s contest coming of a match in which she dropped the first game of her collegiate career to Trinity’s Kanzy El Defrawy.
“Trying to stay undefeated and 3-0, I definitely put a little more pressure on myself in the match against Trinity,” Sobhy said. “But after I lost the first game, I realized you can’t always have a perfect streak. Going into Brown, there was no need to be nervous or put any extra pressure on myself.”Sobhy had little trouble taking down Dori Rahbar of the Bears. Playing in the No. 1 spot, the reigning national champion had the most dominating performance of the night, dishing out 11-1, 11-2, 11-5 wins to move to 5-0 on the year.“She’s just a top class competitor,” Kingshott said. “She handles both her wins and losses in the game with grace. I think she’s in a great place, mentally and physically.”Senior Laura Gemmell picked up another convincing win in the No. 2 position. Gemmell took down Brown’s Mina Shakarashy, 3-0, with 11-5, 11-4, 11-5 victories. With the win, the senior is now 9-0 on the season.Kingshott picked up her tenth win of the season by posting another 3-0 victory in the No. 5 slot with 11-3, 11-8, 11-5 wins over Isabel Pitaro. Classmate Eliza Calihan, playing in the No. 9 position, recorded the only game loss for Harvard on the night. But Calihan still rolled to a 3-1 victory after going 11-5, 2-11, 11-9, 11-6.Playing in the No. 3 spot, sophomore Haley Mendez handled her opponent with 11-4, 11-8, and 11-6 wins to pick up another point for the Crimson. Classmate Julianne Chu, who was out due to injury for much of the season’s earlier matches, remained undefeated on the year with a 11-5, 11-7, 11-3 victory in the No. 6 slot. Sophomore Megan Murray also picked up a win for the Crimson, topping her opponent 11-9, 11-7, 11-7 in the No. 7 slot.First years Saumya Karki and Isabelle Dowling rounded out the matches in the top nine. Karki had an easy time at No. 4, boasting 11-3, 11-7, 11-4 wins, while classmate Dowling had a similarly took care of business in the No. 8 slot, posting a convincing 11-7, 11-7, 11-5 victory.“We played really solidly,” Sobhy said. “Everyone pretty much came out there to play. We wasted little time and did our best.”Coming off back-to-back wins at the end of the week, Harvard will have little time to rest. The team will hit the courts on Sunday afternoon for its regular season finale against Yale. The contest will be a rematch of last year’s CSA Team Final, in which the Crimson rolled to an 8-1 victory to take the national title.“It’s Harvard-Yale,” Kingshott said. “It’s always an exciting, fun match to play. They’re great opponents. It’s competitive. It’s really great to have the home court advantage.”The Crimson’s strong play of late against top-ranked opponents bodes well for Harvard as it looks down the line towards the CSA Team Championships, to be held next weekend in New Haven.“We all realize how important the end of the season is,” Kingshott said. “Staying mentally up for these matches is relatively easy. We’re excited to finally be here.”—Staff writer Brenna R. Nelsen can be reached at brennanelsen@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter at @BrennaRaeN.

In its second weekend of competition, the Harvard women’s water polo team started off with two straight losses, but righted the ship the next day with a pair of victories.Playing in the Princeton Invitational in New Jersey, the Crimson took on two of the best teams in the nation on Saturday in No. 4 California and No. 10 Princeton. Although unranked Harvard competed with both teams for stretches, the Crimson fell to the Golden Bears, 14-5, and lost to the Tigers by a score of 11-7.Harvard took on easier competition Sunday and bounced back first against the New York Athletic Club, cruising to a 20-9 victory. The Crimson ended its road trip on a similarly strong note with a 19-4 win against Villanova.“I thought it was a really good weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “Cal and Princeton are two top-ten teams, and they were both close games in the third, so I thought we did really well. We don’t want to be playing our best water polo in February. We made some mistakes, and we have some things we can go back and work on.”HARVARD 20, NYAC 9
Facing off against the New York Athletic Club, the Crimson dominated from start to finish and coasted to an 11-goal victory.The team outscored NYAC in each quarter, and every Harvard player who entered the pool registered at least a point in the contest.“I think that’s what makes this team so special, is that all ten of [the players] are going to produce this year and do something,” Minnis said. “And I think that’s fun, to watch them go out there and support each other and play hard for each other.”The Crimson was led by freshman Charlotte Hendrix, who posted a career-high seven goals to spearhead the Harvard offense. Hendrix also contributed on the defensive end with a team-best three steals.""I think I performed decently,” Hendrix said. “I still think I have things to improve on, but I was just the one to finish the play; it was really all of us working together to get to that point.”Freshman Yoshi Andersen and sophomore Victoria Frager posted solid offensive numbers with three goals each, and two other players followed with a pair apiece.The Crimson capped off the weekend with a 19-4 win against Villanova. Harvard took advantage of five goals while up a player to record its largest margin of victory on the season.PRINCETON 11, HARVARD 7The Crimson failed to get anything going in the first half against the Tigers, and went into the break trailing, 6-2.Although the Harvard offense kept pace with Princeton in the second half, with each team scoring five goals, the Crimson could never overcome the early deficit.

From Coca-Cola to the literary genre of Southern Gothic, the South has laid some of the most important bricks in America’s cultural foundation. But possibly the most important—at the least, the most widespread—product of the lower states is their music. Even in a modern musical world of mixing forms and aesthetics, the sounds of Dixie are unmistakable, and on their self-titled debut album, the Lone Bellow bring all these sounds together into an irrefutably “Southern” release.While the group officially formed in Brooklyn, the band’s core trio all grew up in small Southern towns. They’ve been lumped in with the current wave of acoustic suspender-snappers like Mumford &amp; Sons and the Lumineers, but the Lone Bellow’s awareness of the genre’s breadth sets them apart from the rest. These three songsters are equally comfortable with country twang as with roaring gospel, and the album showcases their versatility while retaining a sense of intimacy. While it meanders in places—the band’s sound is not yet focused—the album is a promising debut, an array of songs that fit together as heartfelt chronicles of the trials and thrills of romance. Even within one song, primary songwriter and vocalist Zach Williams is able to encapsulate a wide spectrum of emotion. The anthemic “You Never Need Nobody,” a waltzing power ballad, stays soulful as it alternates between pleading, praising, and scorning a loved one. It is a successful exercise in genre-blending, with gentle acoustic strumming and glistening steel guitar highlights that give way to a faux-gospel shout at the top of the rousing chorus. Williams and his fellow vocalists, Brian Elmquist and Kanene Pipkin, have much to show for their two years of close collaboration; even while belting full-bore, they are perfectly synced on every inflection. 
When the subject matter is brighter, Williams’ lyrical style remains substantive, walking the thin line between storytelling and poetry. On ""Green Eyes and a Heart of Gold,"" the exuberant opener, Williams pairs the sparely realistic “All our money’s gone and the house is cold / And it's alright,” with the abstract “We're losing blood with every beat / Our song is not a dying dream,” simultaneously telling the story and capturing the feelings of two people whose mutual love is all they need to build their lives. From the beginning, though, the album is not without its lapses into mundanity. For most of “Green Eyes and a Heart of Gold,” the marching snare drum keeps things bouncing alongside sustained power chords and sprinkles of mandolin. But everything collapses when the guitar solo kicks in; the drums fall into a vapid rock beat, and the ebullience that has been building is lost to overpowering guitar fuzz. The moment is brief, but jarring—even some of the album’s more successful songs tend to take drab left turns.  These unwelcome detours emerge on a larger scale, too. On “Bleeding Out,” the trio's explosive vocals—usually a strong suit—are just one of many elements cranked up to excess. The track abandons the group’s rural blend of acoustic guitar, mandolin, and violin for the sounds of soft rock radio, with layers of electric guitar that in this context become extraneous noise. The highlights of the album are lyrically and musically intimate—the wavering acoustic texture that predominates matches the sensitivity of the album’s themes—and by comparison, “Bleeding Out” rings hollow. The lyrics, too, are lofty and hard to grasp—with lines like the cryptic “Breathing in, breathing out, it’s all in my mouth / Gives me hope that I’ll be something worth bleeding out,” the trio seems uncomfortable dealing in abstractions, especially in contrast to the album’s more successful songs of personal dramas. The only truly effective departure from comfortable territory is the album's closer, a lazy swinger called “Button” that features a sultry Pipkin and a horn section unafraid to jazz things up. The rest of the album could have benefited from more daring asides like “Button,” but the Lone Bellow do enough already to push likely fans to the edges of their comfort zones. Indeed, those seeking the next Fleet Foxes—or conversely, the heirs to Hank Williams—might be disappointed. The album is a smorgasbord of Southern comfort from an omnivorous band, and only fans with broad palettes will eat it up.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.WHAT IT ISIn the wake of the Great Recession, formal college education and its ever-increasing price tag has been under scrutiny from the popular media. To make higher education accessible for all, Bill Gates, Florida governor Rick Scott, and others have proposed the implementation of a $10,000 bachelors degree program. Is it possible? A recent <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/opinion/my-valuable-cheap-college-degree.html?hpw&amp;_r=0"">op-ed in the New York Times details Arthur C. Brooks' flirtation with traditional college, followed by what his parents fondly dubbed a ""gap-decade,"" and finally a return to academia by correspondence. Brooks managed to complete his undergraduate degree as well as two graduate ones without obtaining a cent of debt, and most importantly, all for less than $10,000.<!--more-->  WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
Everyone knows the jab at the price of college (specifically, the cost of Harvard) from ""Good Will Hunting"": most of us are paying $150,000 for an education that, with a bit of determination and and a membership card, we could have gotten for $1.50 in late fees at the library. Unfortunately, the worn-down strip on a library card doesn't replace the increasing need for a B.A., or even an M.A., if we want to get jobs in this competitive economy (unless, of course, you create the most popular social networking website of all time out of your dorm room and eschew a degree entirely).  SO WHAT?Brooks specifically notes that at times his ""college education has been the target of ridicule,"" and that he is ""no Harvard man."" Is a Harvard education the antithesis of the move towards education on a budget?  It is an undeniable fact that the high price of residential four-year colleges in the U.S. shuts out many students who cannot pay; others who are willing to take out loans graduate with crippling debt in an already uncertain job market. Some of the <a href=""http://www.teachthought.com/higher-ed-2/20-ridiculous-us-college-cost-statistics/"">most recent statistics about the cost of college are almost comical: with two thirds of college grads facing an average debt of $20,000, those who work at the ubiquitous Starbucks would have to make 228,000 cups of coffee to pay off their (seemingly useless) degree; 1 in 5 grads must accept a job that doesn't even require a degree; while the average family income grew 147% from 1982-2007, the cost of a bachelor's degree rose 440%. With staggering numbers like these, it's hard to not see the incredible appeal of a $10,000 education. Brooks' tale is one of enormous success—to support a family while simultaneously earning a degree is nothing short of a herculean effort. But his method is not the only newly innovative way to earn an education on a budget; massive open online courses, or <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/education/public-universities-to-offer-free-online-classes-for-credit.html?ref=education"">MOOCs, have gained recent popularity (see, for example, Harvard and MIT's own <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/19/edx-announces-spring-courses/"">edX initiative). Community colleges, long since a more wallet-friendly method of earning a degree, <a href=""https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/college-costs/college-costs-faqs"">cost approximately $3,000 a semester for a two-year associate's degree; city or state universities cost more than twice as much for a four-year bachelor's degree.  The graduation rates for these programs is what is sobering. According to <a href=""http://collegecompletion.chronicle.com/state/#state=ma&amp;sector=public_four"">The Chronicle of Higher Education, only 35.4% of all students in Massachusetts public colleges graduated in 4 years; 56.4% did so in 6 years. The rates plummet to 16.4% for 2-year programs, while private colleges have nearly double those graduation rates.  THE TAKEAWAYThe $10,000 degree is a wonderful idea—get a degree that would have otherwise put you into debt, graduate with no loans and burst forth into the job market a newly minted college grad. But what the idea doesn't address is the reason why so many students fail to graduate from college in the first place. As a college student just entering her second semester, I know I could have never done what Brooks did—I've come to rely on the extensive advising and support systems offered at Harvard through academic advisors, PAFs, proctors, and most importantly, fellow students. Yes, living and studying at Harvard and other four-year residential colleges costs a lot more than $10,000. But most college-age kids I know wouldn't be able to have the discipline or wherewithal to complete their coursework through correspondence. Will a $10,000 degree provide advising and counseling? Could the student conceivably speak to a professor, or discuss a paper and study for an exam with a fellow degree candidate? Or will it, like so many of the more expensive degree programs in place today, yield low graduation rates? Unfortunately, Brooks' experience seems to be the exception, not the rule.  The main problem with the gross discrepancy between cost and success in the U.S. collegiate system is one that digs deeper than a price tag—it has roots in the delicacy of our economy, issues with public elementary, middle, and high school systems, as well as scholarships, grants, and continuing advising programs. States such as <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/florida-colleges-10000-degree_n_2576510.html"">Florida and <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443493304578039040237714224.html"">Texas are currently on their way to implementing such a program in their public universities system. Only time will tell if their soon-to-be-matriculated students will be as successful at education on a budget as was Arthur C. Brooks.

The women’s basketball team took a page out of the men’s basketball playbook this weekend.On Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion, where the Crimson has not lost all season, Harvard (13-6, 4-1 Ivy) squandered a first-half 13-point lead before eking out an overtime win over Cornell (10-9, 2-3 Ivy), 69-60.“I’m very proud we toughed it out and won,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “There were things that happened that I was a little surprised by, and I think our team needs to learn how to extend the lead rather than lose the lead. Unfortunately, that’s been happening too often, and for the kids that we have and the experience that we have and the talent that we have, we have to find the mental fortitude to extend a lead.”After going 8-for-13 from the charity stripe during regulation, the Crimson rallied during the extra period and sunk all 10 of its free throws, including four from senior forward Victoria Lippert, to pull away from the Big Red.“It’s all about that pressure free-throw shooting in practice,” Lippert said.
Overtime was dominated by fouls, as 10 of Harvard’s 16 points came from the line, and free throws accounted for all of Cornell’s points except for an unguarded three at the end of the period.Sophomore forward Erin McDonnell hit a pull-up jumper to give the Crimson the first points in the extra period following a drought that had lasted since there was 1:35 left in regulation. Harvard would not relinquish the lead again.After two converted free shots by the Big Red’s Allyson DiMagno, McDonnell grabbed an offensive board off her own miss and fed it to Lippert, who tossed in the ball to push Harvard out to a three-point lead. Junior guard Christine Clark then drove in for a layup to give the Crimson some breathing room.DiMagno, who netted 20 points and 14 rebounds to be the only player on the day with a double-double, scored all but three of the Big Red’s points in overtime and hit two jumpers near the end of the second half to knot the game at 51-all. Harvard struggled all day with stopping the junior, who averages 13.4 points per game.“That wasn’t the game plan, to let [DiMagno] have that many,” Lippert said. “It’s definitely something that we’re going to correct for next time, pay more attention to her. That’s just too many points and rebounds for somebody to have against us. We’re not too pleased about those stats.”Delaney-Smith called a timeout immediately after Cornell senior forward Clare Fitzpatrick drove in for a layup to tie the game at 53, but the Big Red, with fouls to give, fouled sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle with 1.6 seconds remaining, and the Crimson couldn’t get a clean inbounds pass in to take a shot with the time remaining, sending the game into overtime.“[I told them before overtime that] this is our gym,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s all about defense for five minutes.”Harvard jumped out to an early 9-2 lead and never trailed in the game. Clark paved the way for the Crimson’s quick beginning, scoring eight of her 15 points in the first 10 minutes of the game. The Crimson dominated inside in the first half, outrebounding Cornell 24-12 and scoring 14 points in the paint to the Big Red’s four.Cornell went on a 7-3 run to close the first half, and a layup from DiMagno at the beginning of the second half closed the lead to four before Lippert sunk a shot from downtown. The senior broke a four-minute drought with three consecutive baskets to return the lead to double digits after missing all four of her shots in the first half.“Vic wasn’t playing particularly well in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were all telling her to catch and shoot some. She’s a senior—she generally doesn’t have to be told that, but I do think that our team is trying to share the ball, move the ball, and get easier shots, and so in her effort to maybe do that, she passed up shots I don’t want her to pass up. I thought she did much better in the second half.”The Big Red reversed the advantage on Harvard in the second half, pulling down 20 rebounds to Harvard’s 13 and besting the Crimson in points down low as well. Fitzpatrick, who hit the final shot of the half, contributed 13 points to shrink Harvard’s lead.“They came back off of second chances,” Lippert said. “They were kind of getting more attempts offensively and getting their own rebounds and put backs, and I think that may have contributed to them coming back.”Lippert recorded 19 points to lead Harvard’s offensive effort while Clark and Fagbenle joined her in double-digits with 15 and 12 points, respectively.—Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samanthalin@college.harvard.edu.

Three years ago this month, on Feb. 1, 2010, a highly-touted freshman and sophomore went head-to-head for the first time at TD Banknorth Garden.The rookie, Boston College’s Chris Kreider, scored a goal to help lead his Eagles to a dominating 6-0 Beanpot semifinal win over Harvard, whose own talented forward, Alex Killorn ’12, registered three shots on net in the loss.The pair would not meet again until Sunday night, when they faced off once more in an NHL Arena.But this time, at Madison Square Garden, the intracity rivals were no longer collegiate stars. Instead, they were representing their professional teams—Kreider is on the New York Rangers, and Killorn, making his NHL debut, was playing for the Tampa Bay Lightning.The right wing was called up by the Lightning on Sunday, marking a rapid ascension to hockey’s highest stage for the former Crimson standout who graduated just nine months ago.
“We’re happy for him,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He's a great kid, was a great player for us, a great person and he's worked really hard. We’re very happy to see his dream coming true, having a chance to play in the National Hockey League. And what a great venue, Madison Square Garden. So we'll be pulling hard for him and we're very proud of how far he's come.”Under the lights at the world’s most famous arena, wearing No. 17, and playing on the road team’s third line, Killorn made an immediate impact, registering an assist and two shots on goal in a 5-1 Rangers win. He also accumulated two minutes in the penalty box for high-sticking Kreider, who left Boston College during his junior year to join the Rangers late last season.“I think I got the jitters out of the way in the first period,” Killorn said. “I felt a lot better in the 2nd.”His parents—who postponed a vacation to Puerto Rico—as well as other family members and friends were in attendance to see the game. Killorn told The Syracuse Post-Standard that his mother cried when he told her the news of his call-up.“It's a really good feeling,” Killorn said. “You don't know when it's going to come.”The feeling finally came on Saturday, when Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman—a former hockey star in his own right—made the decision to waive wing Dana Tyrell and promote Killorn, a third round pick by the team in 2007.""He's a big body that protects the puck extremely well,"" Lightning coach Guy Boucher told The Tampa Bay Times. ""He's got a great shot and is extremely smart.""The Harvard grad said he received the news from Syracuse GM Julien BriseBois, who woke him from a pregame nap.""He asked me if I was ready to come help Tampa beat the Rangers,"" Killorn told The Tampa Bay Times.Though he was unable to do that, the wing’s promotion nonetheless represented a rapid rise to the NHL for the former All-American, who ranked in the top five in the country in goals and points per game as a Crimson senior.

Since its release on January 15, the book Total Frat Move by W.R. Bolen has rocketed into the New York Times Best Seller list. Hailed as the next Animal House, TFM glorifies everything that makes Greek life one of the most stereotyped parts of American college culture. According to the jacket cover, TFM is a “national update on college fraternities” where “the amount of alcohol that is being consumed, promiscuous sex that is being enjoyed, and intense drug-induced raging that is taking place on campuses across the country has quietly reached ridiculous new heights.” While the accuracy of W.R. Bolen’s representation of fraternity life at American universities is certainly debatable, the book’s rapid ascent through the bestseller charts testifies that the public continues to be fascinated by the prevalent, yet mysterious culture that exists on over 800 <a href=""http://studentorgs.gwu.edu/greekspeak/extras/nationalstatistics/"">U.S. and Canadian campuses including Harvard’s.Though the final clubs at Harvard have long dominated fraternities because of their histories and more prominent real estate, Greek life is becoming increasingly visible at Harvard in the form of sororities. In 2011, recruitment numbers for Harvard’s sororities reached a peak of 268 women. While that number dropped slightly last year to 250 women, the consistently large numbers of potential new members has caused Harvard’s Pan-Hellenic Council to add an additional sorority to campus. This year Alpha Phi will join Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma in recruiting new members. Even with this growth, Harvard remains staunch in its refusal to recognize Greek life on campus.Despite the lack of recognition, on February 2 potential new members flocked to the first night of recruitment for many reasons. Some like freshman Julia Kee were looking to “find a group of like-minded people.” Others were seeking a family away from home, philanthropic opportunities, or a broader social scene. No matter what their reasons were, that night they entered into a world that may not breed success, but from which successful individuals certainly spring. According to George Washington University’s “<a href=""http://studentorgs.gwu.edu/greekspeak/extras/nationalstatistics/"">Greek Speak” website, though only <a href=""http://www.whygogreek.com/stats.html"">3 percent of Americans were once involved with Greek life, 76 percent of the United States Congress were once involved. All but two U.S. Presidents and Vice-Presidents since 1825 have been fraternity members. On a more feminine note, the first female senator and the first female astronaut were sorority members, and they are joined in Greek life by 71 percent of the “Who’s Who in America.” Harvard women have decided that the benefits of Greek life, in addition to its correlation with future success, outweigh Harvard’s lack of support.Of Harvard College’s approximately 6,700 students, <a href=""http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/harvard-university-2155"">3,350 are female. Delta Gamma has <a href=""http://www.dgzetaphi.com/aboutus/index.php"">135 members; Kappa Kappa Gamma has 125; and Kappa Alpha Theta has 108. Two hundred and fifty women went through recruitment again this year, which means that 618 Harvard women were involved or were interested in becoming involved with Greek life on campus. That is almost a fifth of Harvard women.Eighteen percent is a number that rivals some of the largest student organizations on campus. At <a href=""http://pbha.org/about/history/"">1,400 volunteers, the entire PBHA program makes up 21 percent of campus. In 2010, Harvard reported having <a href=""http://www.fldcu.org/massachusetts/harvard-university/"">1142 athletes playing 42 varsity sports, which is about 17 percent of the student body. These numbers demonstrate clearly that Greek life is a prominent and, arguably, a dominant part of women’s’ lives on campus. By not recognizing Greek life, Harvard ignores a powerful segment of the student population.
I can understand Harvard’s qualms about Greek life. I would imagine that college administrators have watched Animal House, and the recent success of Total Frat Move certainly confirms the belief that Greek life is a breeding ground for immoral and illegal behavior. Perhaps Harvard does not wish to associate itself with such negative stereotypes—despite the many benefits of Greek life, such as scholarship, service, networking and philanthropy, which have been called “some of the most rewarding parts of Greek life” by sophomore and Kappa Kappa Gamma council member Anna Menzel.Recently, Harvard has chosen to associate itself with both a BDSM sex club and a group that promotes premarital abstinence and a traditional view of marriage, the Harvard College Abscombe Society. In recognizing socially controversial and contradictory groups, College administrators have clearly shown that though they may not agree with the values or actions of particular student groups, they still believe that these groups should have the right to exist on campus. Additionally, though allegedly Greek culture promotes underage drinking and other illegal activities, most students could easily name many Harvard recognized student groups that also engage in such behaviors. With this in mind, and in the light of recruitment season, Harvard needs to lay down its copy of Total Frat Move and reexamine its stance on Greek life and social organization recognition.Tessa A.C.

The Harvard Divinity School announced a $10 million gift from James R. Swartz ’64 and former Divinity School artist-in-residence Susan Shallcross Swartz last Wednesday. The donation—one of the largest in the school’s history—will fund the creation of the Susan Shallcross Swartz Endowment for Christian Studies, supporting new professorships, fellowships, and programming at the Divinity School.“My hope is that the endowment will inspire scholarship and reinvigorate debate, service, and teaching for generations to come,” Susan Swartz said in a press release.The gift comes as Harvard plans to embark on a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/3/capital-campaign-university-wide/"">University-wide capital campaign as soon as late 2013.Swartz said she hopes the endowment will “allow [Divinity School] Dean [David N.] Hempton to take the School into the future, and to improve the currency of the leadership that HDS exercises.”The donation is the first notable gift received by the school since <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/31/divinity-school-dean-new/"">Hempton became its dean in 2012.
“The Swartz Endowment will expand our ability to assemble the leading scholars and thinkers in the field—and to draw the talented students that they attract. We are deeply grateful to Susan and Jim for their generosity, and for their continued faith in our mission,” Hempton said in the press release.Susan Swartz served as the Divinity School’s first artist-in-residence in 2005 and has also served on the school’s Dean’s Council. She now works as a professional American landscape painter, working from studios based in Massachusetts and Utah.According to her website, Swartz is ""inspired by the natural world and the intersection of spirituality and art” in her paintings.Swartz, who served as artist-in-residence at the Divinity School under former dean William A. Graham’s tenure, said in the statement that she was impressed by Graham’s commitment during his leadership to “keeping the oldest divinity school in the country a vibrant place of scholarship and reflection” and hopes that the $10 million donation will help keep this energy alive and flourishing.James Swartz is active in venture capital, serving as a founding partner of Accel Partners—a global venture and growth equity firm that funds companies from their inception and throughout their growth.The last major donation to the Divinity School prior to Susan and James Swartz’s donation happened in Oct. 2011, when the Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/11/divinity-school-receives-donation/"">gave $2.7 million to support the founding of The Buddhist Ministry Initiative­—a program to foster the training of Buddhist ministers at the Divinity School.The school has a history of attracting substantial donations, dating back to January 1954 when <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1954/1/12/john-d-rockefeller-gives-1-million/"">John D. Rockefeller Jr. gave $1 million towards the Divinity School’s endowment.The Divinity School and Susan and James Swartz could not be reached for comment Sunday.—Staff writer Zohra D.

In a new weekly series by The Back Page, Harvard beat  writers will discuss topics about a Crimson athletics team. In this  edition, basketball beat writers Hope Schwartz and David Freed discussed  the men’s basketball team’s future in the Ivy League as well as their  frontcourt rotation and ability to close out games.
 
David Freed: What worries me about this  team is that they always seem to play down to the level of its competition and that they can't hang onto leads. It happened in the  first game of the season against UMass and again this weekend against  Brown. Luckily, the Bears aren't as good as Chaz Williams and co. but it  did cost them against St. Mary's and they needed a huge comeback against  Dartmouth just to win that game. I see Harvard having trouble when it  can't push the ball or Siyani needs to take a rest just because the  offense really revolves around his drives. Also, free throw shooting has  not been up to par recently. Thoughts?<a name=""jump"">
 
Hope Schwartz: On the flip  side of playing down to its competition, we've also seen this team play  up in amazing ways. While it definitely worries me that they needed an  epic comeback and a whole lot of luck to beat Dartmouth (literally the  worst team in the Ivy League... sorry Gabas Maldunas, but facts are  facts), Amaker and co. need only to look back to the end of 2012 to remember what  this team is capable of. In an upset win against Cal, we saw Wes  Saunders step up on defense against Bears top scorer Allen Crabbe, and a  strong offensive showing by the Crimson allowed the team to overcome  Crabbe's 27 points. Against St. Mary's, Jonah Travis came through huge  with 19 points and a dominant post presence, something the team has been  lacking all season. The point is that all the pieces are there, but it  remains to be seen whether it can all come together.
 
DF: Speaking of Travis, to me he's probably the most  interesting players on the team. Catherine Coppinger’s feature on him  last week does justice to the way he hustles and scrapes for loose  balls, even though he's a six-six center. However, down the stretch  Travis rarely will see the floor. Against Dartmouth, the entire comeback  was essentially made with Steve on the floor and Travis riding the  pine. I get that Steve is a better defensive player and compensates a  little bit more for Harvard's lack of length on the outside, but Jonah is a  more polished offensive player and, crucially, he shoots 65% from the  line against Steve's 57%. Especially looking forward against Princeton  and Ian Hummer, one of the two has to step up for Harvard to take down the  Tigers in two games that will probably decide the Crimson's season. On that note,  what do you make of Princeton? They were really underwhelming in  nonconference play—they could only score 42 points in 45 minutes against  Wagner—but they've gotten out of the gates strong with three straight  wins. Hummer leads them in literally every offensive category (points,  boards, assists, etc.) but is he good enough to beat  Harvard—essentially—on his own or will they need other players to step  up and make room? Hummer matches up with the weakest part of Harvard's team,  interior D, so moving forward it'll be important to try and make other  Tigers beat the Crimson.
 
HS: The Travis vs  Moundou-Missi debate is one of the most underrated story lines of the  season so far. After starting Mondou-Missi in the first five games of  the season, Amaker didn't seem too impressed with him averaging fewer  than five points per game. Travis is clearly the more powerful post  presence, but--and here I would disagree with you--he lacks the polish  necessary to be a consistent impact player down the stretch in close  games. Travis' scrappy style of play puts him at risk for foul  trouble, and he's fouled out three times this season. Moundou-Missi, on  the other hand, seems to be the more balanced player, coming down with  nine key rebounds against Brown and averaging more than twice as many as  Travis during conference play. However, going up against a player like  Hummer, it may be necessary to take a risk with Travis to compensate  with power on the other end. What would you do in Amaker's situation?
 
DF: Much like what the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics did  against Howard, it might be worth it to start with Travis and let him  get fouls and then just sub in Steve and Kenyatta as needed. Between  them there are 15 fouls Harvard can use to bother Hummer. That might be the  most effective strategy since the Crimson can try and tire him out of the course  of the game and take him out of the action. With Missi being the less  foul-prone of the two, I agree that it probably makes sense to use him  to end games, especially in close games where fouls can really harm us.  With Princeton losing Saturday, if Harvard can win the game at home  Saturday, it doesn't even need to win in Jadwin. But that only makes  this game—and Amaker's strategy going forward—that much more important.

The Harvard men’s tennis team emerged victorious on all fronts this weekend: not only did it avoid the blizzard that swamped Cambridge with a trip to Evanston, Ill., but it also earned two wins this weekend at the Combe Tennis Center at Northwestern University.On Saturday, the No. 47 Crimson (4-3) squeaked by the host No. 33 Wildcats (9-3), 4-3, after two doubles tiebreakers gave the decisive doubles point to Harvard. Then, on Sunday, the Crimson defeated No. 40 Vanderbilt (5-3) by the same score.“It was a great weekend,” co-captain Andy Nguyen said. “We fought hard and it was definitely good to get these big wins against good [major conference] schools.”HARVARD 4, VANDERBILT 3Although the Crimson beat the Commodores by the same margin as it did Northwestern, it was a much more comfortable 4-3 victory.
Fish spoke well of his team’s play relative to its play against Northwestern.“We were even better [than on Saturday],” he said. “We came at them from the beginning.”Unlike in Saturday’s tiebreakers in the doubles matches, Harvard earned easier doubles victories against the Commodores. On the second court, freshman Nicky Hu and Andy Nguyen scored an 8-3 victory over Vanderbilt’s Gonzales Austin and Suresh Eswaran, and the No. 1 team of sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster took an 8-4 win to give the Crimson the doubles point.In singles, sophomore Alex Steinroeder and Andy Nguyen both won easily—6-1, 6-2, and 6-1, 6-1, respectively—to give Harvard an early 3-0 lead that would ensure they would not have to come back as they did against the Wildcats.The Commodores made things interesting by winning three singles matches, including No. 17 Ryan Lipman’s fifth straight match victory. He beat the Crimson’s Denis Nguyen 6-2, 6-3 at No. 1. But Harvard sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri pulled away in the third set for a 7-6, 2-6, 6-0 win to give the Crimson its fourth point and the victory.HARVARD 4, NORTHWESTERN 3Although Northwestern entered the weekend with an 8-1 record, Harvard was able to produce a dramatic and narrow 4-3 triumph.The Wildcats started things off with an 8-4 victory over Steinroeder and Chaudhuri in No. 3 doubles, but the Crimson struck back when the No. 2 team of Andy Nguyen and Hu edged Northwestern with a 8-7 (7-2) victory.Harvard completed the doubles comeback when the first team of Denis Nguyen and MacMaster survived a challenge from the Wildcats’ Sidarth Balaji and Raleigh Smith, winning 8-7 (13-11) to give the Crimson the doubles point.That comeback would prove pivotal in giving Harvard victory.

                        How To
                    
</h2>
You may have heard of the new dating app Tinder, in which you look at the name, age and profile picture of local singles and swipe left or right based on your approval. If the feeling is mutual, it's a match, and you can start communicating immediately.In the name of scholarly research and objectifying men, I downloaded the app. Two days later, I have over fifteen matches and only one restraining order. Now an expert at Tinder, I've decided to provide you all with a few of my tips for success.<!--more-->1. Add an animalIt's a well-known fact that a man with a group of women, or a woman posing next to a man, makes him or her psychologically more desirable. What is less of a known fact is that animals have the same effect. If you put an animal in your profile picture—be it a cat, a dog, or a starfish—people are more likely to like you. 39-year-old Dave just used a picture of a bear. Damn! I'd swipe that.2. Always assume the worst
When you are looking at a photo with multiple people (or multiple animals), always assume that the single person in question is the least attractive of the lot. If it is a pair at the beach with one member shirtless, your potential match is probably the fully dressed and less toned of the two. When looking at large group photos, don't be surprised if your match is the one with the paper bag covering his or her face, or, as in many cases, the person taking the photo. But don't let this stop you from liking them; a good photographer is hard to come by!3. Use emoticonsWords can be awkward. So if you do get a match it is best to start the communication with emoticons. When someone says ""heyyy,"" try responding with a winky-face or an Emoji of a bowl of Ramen. I always like using the chicken-hatching-out-of-the-egg emoticon to get the conversation rolling. There is nothing sexier than subtle allusions to cage free produce. Only use the English language when it becomes completely necessary, which would be to clarify your absurd use of emoticons.4. Blame a friendIf things get out of hand—if a random food emoticon goes unanswered or a match refuses your job offer to photograph your sister's wedding—blame it all on a friend. ""Sorry,"" you should communicate with a bashful-looking smiley face emoticon, ""my friend took my phone."" Not only does this save face, but it also creates the impression that you have a friend.

America’s invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were predicated upon the notion that a safe haven for terrorists anywhere threatens America’s national interests. This idea made sense when a mostly Saudi group of terrorists managed to murder nearly 3,000 Americans in the September 11, 2001 attacks. <del> </del>The world has grown only more interconnected since. <del> </del>The U.S. was largely successful in driving Islamic militants out of much of the Middle East, a result of a decade of ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a continued use of unmanned drones as far away as <a href=""http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/us-makes-a-drone-attack-a-day-in-yemen"">Yemen.Many of the Islamic militants driven from the Middle East moved into Africa, particularly Mali, and managed to take over an area <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/france-us-helping-in-mali-86104.html"">larger than all of mainland France.<del> </del> Allowing any safe haven for terrorists, President George W. Bush would have argued, goes against our national interest, and, as such, we have a right to use military force to stop them. <del> </del>France’s President François G. G. N. Hollande seems to have used this rationale when he decided to send the French military into Mali to combat the militants there.Bear in mind that the French president that decided to involve the military was not Nicolas Sarkozy, the right-wing leader who further entangled France in Afghanistan, Libya, and the Ivory Coast. <del> </del>No, the President who engaged militarily in Mali is Hollande, the Socialist politician who was widely perceived to be <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/world/europe/francois-hollande-moves-away-from-his-image.html"">softer than flan and more indecisive than Hamlet. One could conceivably claim that Hollande needed to play the part of a warrior to toughen his image at home, but I have a difficult time believing that a Socialist leader who would cut government spending by <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9574067/Hollande-launches-austerity-budget.html"">€12.5 billion in the interest of fiscal health would engage in a costly military conflict without good cause.France’s decision to invade Mali in many ways vindicates the Bush Doctrine.<del> </del> France has sent its military into sovereign territory in order to protect itself from perceived threats, emulating one of the hallmarks of our last administration’s foreign policy. <del> </del>The United States, Bush maintained, had the right to use force against countries harboring terrorist groups. <del> </del>At the time, France was one of the most public critics of America’s aggressive foreign policy stance. <del> </del>In a largely unnoticed role-reversal, America has become the tepid partner <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323301104578253824061131556.html"">trying to avoid the costs of war.Some key differences do persist between the wars of Bush and Hollande. <del> </del>France is doing everything in its power to leave Mali as soon as possible and turn over military control to African forces.  Furthermore, France has limited its actual combat as much as possible rather than take over all of Mali in one fell swoop. <del> </del>These welcome policies do mark a shift from the more troop-heavy, longer-term wars of the Bush Administration. <del> </del>However, the inescapable fact remains that France committed ground troops in order to fight terrorists on another continent in the name of national interest.
President Barack Obama is not an adherent to Bush’s foreign policy. <del> </del>So why is Hollande?  Perhaps the war in Mali was orchestrated as a political move of sorts, in which the primary motive has more to do with perception than the reality on the ground in northern Africa.  More likely, though, is the probability that Hollande simply determined that allowing Islamic militants to control much of Mali posed a national security threat to France. <del> </del>The Bush Doctrine, it seems, is alive and well—in France.The past four years have seen an eclectic mix of American foreign policy maneuvers.  While Obama has embraced and drastically expanded the use of unmanned drones to target individuals, he has assiduously avoided committing troops to any conflict. <del> </del>He eagerly embraced democratic change in his speeches as the Arab Spring swept the Middle East<del>,</del> but refrained from more actively supporting democratic agents, such as those in Syria. <del> </del>With the exception of Obama’s widely lauded commitment to keeping our troops out of combat, no unified doctrine seems to be guiding his decisions, for better or for worse.Obama has not quite rejected Bush’s foreign policy, but he certainly hasn’t embraced it, either. François Hollande, on the other hand, has caught critics flat-footed in his seeming emulation of George W. Bush’s foreign strategies. <del> </del>A year ago, few would have guessed that Bush’s legacy would be carried on by a socialist French administration. <del> </del>But Hollande has in large part justified Bush’s foreign policy with his own intervention in Mali. We’ll call it the Hollande Doctrine, because Hollande is probably not the biggest fan of Bush.Jacob R. Drucker ‘15, a Crimson editorial writer, is an economics concentrator in Mather House.

Twenty-two years is a long time for anyone to stay dormant. Even before My Bloody Valentine announced “m b v,”—their first album since 1991’s “Loveless,”—2013 seemed to be destined to be the year of the comeback for artists who have long been out of the limelight. But David Bowie has released six albums in the past 22 years. It’s only been seven years since Justin Timberlake’s “FutureSex/LoveSounds.” Entire careers of other shoegazing artists, such as Lush, would have been born and dissolved in the span of 22 years—twice.My Bloody Valentine’s first album in two decades is and probably will remain the biggest drop of 2013, an already promising year in which Skrillex was featured on an A$AP Rocky track. Perhaps the quietest My Bloody Valentine album yet, “m b v” lacks the teeth of “Isn’t Anything” and fails to match the stunning innovation of “Loveless.” But thanks to the band’s newfound level of intimacy and its inspired style, “m b v” is a universally accessible album that showcases the band’s expertise, even after an extended hiatus. The opening track, “She Found Now,” defines the sound palette for the rest of the album. As the guitars buzz and frontman Kevin Shields croons soft, indecipherable sounds, My Bloody Valentine immediately establish “m b v” as more intimate than “Loveless.” Instead of making the album seem unadventurous, however, this closeness is welcoming. The familiar blanket of sound knit by “She Found Now” instantly brings with it memories of the murky guitars on “Loveless,” albeit in a more understated manner. 
Part of the intimacy of “mbv” comes from the meticulously recorded drum track that was cut first by Jimi Shields, removed, and then redone by their original drummer, Colm Ó Cíosóig. With the exception of the tracks “In Another Way” and “Nothing Is”—which feature brazen drum tracks that share center stage with the usually uncontested sound of guitars—“m b v” explores a wide array of unobtrusive drum tracks, most parts sinking into the blanket of sound rather than providing their own distinct timbres. Even the more upbeat “Who Sees You” uses Cíosóig’s track in a textural way, the repetitive beat eventually becoming the wheels on which the song churns forth.  The finest example of this understated sound comes in the minimalistic and daring “Is This and Yes,” a meditative amalgam of ringing synthesizers and seemingly wordless vocals. The track sounds almost like a tone poem in that the interest lies in the transition between one tonal quality to the next rather than in the details of any particular instrumental or vocal tracks. As the fourth track on the album, “Is This and Yes” comes a little too soon to feel like a truly introspective oasis within the framework of “m b v,” but it still makes its point: My Bloody Valentine are no longer defining shoegazing—they’re exploring it.  Although “m b v” is deeply personal, it also stands as a much bigger album than the sum of its parts, thanks to its experimental nature and its relationship to My Bloody Valentine’s larger discography. It has all the makings of what would have been a classic album had it been released in the 1990s, when much of its development occurred. But today, it is evident that in My Bloody Valentine’s two silent decades, the album has only aged well. My Bloody Valentine’s “m b v” rounds out their trio of full-length LPs perfectly. “Isn’t Anything” arrived in 1988 with a sound that was explored and tested through “Loveless.” But it is only on “m b v” that My Bloody Valentine really master the shoegazing sound. On this album, Shields proves that he is comfortable enough to take risks with unconventional song structure and compositional choices.  A prime example of this experimentation is the track “Nothing Is,” which features Shields and Cíosóig jamming on a single chord, creating a broken-record effect that tempts listeners to check their discs for imperfections. “Nothing Is”—along with “In Another Way”— rounds out “m b v” with confidence as they carve a new facet of noisy, driving energy into the classically mellow genre of shoegazing.  This daringness contributes a sense of honesty to My Bloody Valentine’s latest album—shoegazing isn’t new anymore, and embracing this revelation seems to have untangled all the reservations in My Bloody Valentine’s sound. “m b v” is the frank work of a master who understands his genre better than anyone. Shoegazing still isn’t a genre for perfection, but by acknowledging this, “m b v” comes closer than ever before. This new album doesn’t herald a heroic return of classic My Bloody Valentine, nor does it feel like a simple regurgitation of their previous material. Rather, “m b v” provides an immersion into Kevin Shields’s 22 years of silence. The quiet, closed-doors approach of the album makes it seem as though Shields is pointing a satellite dish at these lost decades, picking up the faint echoes and remnants of noise left by “Loveless” and rearranging them in both familiar and innovative patterns. The result is equally personal and remarkable—an album that finally cements My Bloody Valentine’s lasting legacy. Staff writer Se-Ho b. Kim can be reached at sehokim@college.harvard.edu

Twenty-four hours before its tipoff against the Columbia Lions (10-10, 2-4 Ivy), the Harvard men’s basketball team (13-7, 5-1) remained one of two undefeated teams atop the Ivy League. After Yale pulled off a stunning upset at Jadwin Gymnasium Saturday night, defeating previously undefeated Princeton, the Crimson entered its Sunday matchup as the sole Ancient Eight squad without a loss.It wouldn’t last.The Lions gave Harvard its first loss in February, 78-63, and performed well in every facet of the game. Columbia’s performance was arguably its most complete of the season. The Lions shot 51 percent from the field—including 53 percent from behind the arc—outrebounded Harvard by eight, and boasted 18 assists against 10 turnovers (the Crimson finished with six assists against 13 turnovers).“Certainly an outstanding performance by Columbia,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was obvious how well they played this afternoon.”No opponent in Ivy League play had eclipsed the 50 percent mark against Harvard from beyond the three-point line before Columbia’s outburst on Sunday. The Lions scored more than any other Ivy League opponent had against the Crimson, boasted the largest rebounding margin (+8) of Harvard’s Ancient Eight opponents, and shot the highest percentage (50.9 percent) of any Crimson conference opponent this season.
FRANK(oski) AND SIMPLEA large portion of the Lions’ damage was done by junior guard Steve Frankoski, who led the team with 27 points Sunday. Frankoski nailed five of the seven three-pointers he took, with many coming in transition as point guard Brian Barbour found him time after time as the trailer.“I thought Frankoski was an amazing offensive weapon that they had today,” Amaker said. “They shot the ball well, got  him out of the blocks early and kept us on our heels throughout the game. We had no answer for him and I thought they played off of him really well.”A 6’2” guard, Frankoski shoots nearly 46 percent from three-point territory. He stole the ball from Harvard co-captain Christian Webster on the first play of the game and a minute later started off the Columbia scoring with a three-pointer from the wing. Thirty-eight minutes later, he finished the night with two free throws from the line.In the first half, Frankoski was the difference. Although the Crimson trailed by one or two for most of the half, the New Jersey native took over with five minutes remaining in the period. Nailing two free throws, Frankowski proceeded a minute later to nail back-to-back three-point jumpers from the corner. That brought the lead from one to seven and gave Frankoski 20 points at the break.SHINING IN A LOSING EFFORTDespite the loss, Harvard had a pair of stars submit noteable performances against the Lions. Sophomore Wesley Saunders had his most effective game of the season, missing only three total shots on the night. Saunders ended the day with 27 points on only 11 shots, earning himself 10 trips to the foul line and knocking down long jumper after long jumper in the first half to keep the Crimson in the game.Saunders was the lone Crimson player to shoot over 50 percent as the rest of the team staggered to poor shooting nights. Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers made eight of 10 from the line but missed four of six shots and had five turnovers against only three assists. Webster missed five of his seven shots, including four of five treys, and sharpshooter junior Laurent Rivard connected on only two of his six attempts from behind the arc.In total, the team hit only four of its thirteen shots from three for a 31 percent clip, 10 percent below its season average.On the defensive end, sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi gave Harvard valuable bench minutes. With a small rotation in place (Harvard’s other bench players combined for 13 minutes, one point, and no rebounds or assists), Moundou-Missi is the Crimson’s key reserve. On Sunday, he put up six points, seven rebounds, and six blocks in just 27 points of action.“I thought Steve gave us great energy and effort,” Amaker said. “He made up for mistakes on dribble penetration. He protected the rim as much as he could. I thought he did as much as he possible could do. Looking at his stat line, we can’t ask for much more from Steve.”—Staff writer David P.

For more than 40 years, Oona’s Experienced Clothing has cultivated a reputation as an old-fashioned vintage clothing seller tucked away on Mass. Ave. in Harvard Square. But since it came under new ownership two years ago, the store has begun to move in a new, more modern direction.Young business owner Eleanor “Ellie” Mueller, who took over the store in August 2010, has already made changes to the interior of Oona’s and is looking to introduce new modern merchandise and expand the store’s online presence in the coming weeks.This month, Mueller is launching an online store on Oona’s existing website, where she will sell current and designer brands in addition to the store’s vintage stock.She plans to also begin selling current and designer brands inside the store by mid-March.“When I started thinking about someone else taking over, I thought of its potential and all of the things someone could do to hold on to what was great about it, but reinvent it a little bit,” Mueller said.
To celebrate the launch, Mueller is hosting a fashion show, which will be open to the public, on Sunday, Feb. 17, at UpStairs on the Square. The runway will hearken back to the store’s vintage roots by featuring approximately 20 models wearing some of the store’s most unique and high fashion pieces.“I think there will be a pretty good mix of different eras on our runway, but they all have that unusual and refreshing quality to them,” she said.To go along with her product changes, Mueller has also looked to transform the physical appearance of her store. She has undertaken several store renovations, such as redecorating the shop with rugs and furniture to give customers the sense that they had entered someone’s home.“Most people react to the space a lot now,” she added.Mueller said she believes the store’s new direction will create opportunities for creative and business success.“I’m always just looking for interesting designs, and I think by not taking modern clothing, we’re really cutting ourselves off from offering all these amazing pieces to people,” Mueller said.Still, Mueller said she sees value in her store’s traditional vintage merchandise. Mueller said that while modern fashion is dominated by a specific trend each season, vintage clothing offers people a broader variety of styles and allows them to decide for themselves what to wear.“For me, [vintage] is not about recreating a different time period, but more just valuing what they did well,” she said.—Staff writer Nikki D.

It is the start of a new semester, which means shopping week frustration, frantic book purchasing, and, for a growing proportion of students on campus, rushing one of several social organizations that fall under the umbrella of Greek life on campus. This past week <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/5/sorority-recruitment-numbers-constant/"">marked the beginning of sorority recruitment, a process whose spiking interest has forced the school’s Pan-Hellenic Council to add another group, women’s fraternity Alpha Phi. While we have previously <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/9/29/social-organizations-harvard-greek/"">bemoaned the increasing prevalence of Greek life on campus, we now recognize that students who look to the sororities or fraternities for vibrant social life are responding rationally to the College’s stringent drinking policies. Greek organizations are an ultimately positive force for the Harvard community.Our earlier critique of the Greek system noted its genesis as an outgrowth of Harvard’s abject failure to create a satisfactory social scene for those interested in fraternizing with classmates outside of section. We also lamented the gender division present in Greek life, which we still find regrettable. However, the positives of Greek life, such as added social vibrancy and a relatively inclusive rush process, appear to outweigh the negatives of gender exclusivity. And while we still sympathize with the College’s interminable crusade to promote campus community, it is unfair to expect current students to sit by the inoperative fireplaces in their dormitories and wait patiently as the Office of Student Life brainstorms how to improve social life. Harvard has thus far been stunningly bad in making progress on this issue. At the moment, the school’s <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/15/crimson-harvard-alcohol-pong/"">paternalistic alcohol policies make students feel unwelcome even in their own environs, a situation that inevitably creates the natural curiosity about friendships possibly attainable outside the confines of in loco parentis.Harvard creates a particularly demanding environment, both academically and socially, and the average student should have the inalienable right to, as Supreme Court Justice and Harvard Law graduate Anthony M. Kennedy ’61 put it, “define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” In writing the decision for Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he went on, “People have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society.” The College should let students organize the relationships they please by recognizing Greek organizations, especially considering the overbearing policies the College imposes upon its residents.Most graduates of Harvard College emerge with impressive résumés and extensive LinkedIn profiles. Yet while Harvardians may enter the world with thick Rolodexes full of future contacts, we believe the administration’s regime begets a fundamental deficiency in the development of a meaningful life on campus outside of academia. It is up to individual students to define their own concept of existence here, a daunting task for a sizeable portion of the population. Some students are able to find fulfillment in a capella groups or cultural clubs, while others seek it within their House Committees or sports teams. We see no reason that Greek organizations should be maligned or stigmatized for filling a similar role on campus.

It couldn’t be much worse for the Penn men’s basketball team.
After an underwhelming 2-12 non-conference record, the Quakers came into Ivy League play looking to silence the critics. The potential was there, with guard Miles Cartwright and forward Fran Dougherty combining as the league’s highest scoring duo. But Penn couldn’t get it done, falling to Cornell and Yale at home as the team played itself out of contention.<a name=""jump"">
The Quakers haven’t just lost conference games; now they have lost key players as well. Dougherty—the team’s second leading scorer with 13.8 points per game despite missing eight games with mononucleosis—went down against Cornell with a dislocated elbow. He will likely be out for the rest of the season.
Junior guard Steve Rennard didn’t last much longer, reportedly tearing his plantar fascia in practice last Monday in Penn’s second season-ending injury of the week. Although he has averaged only 4.2 points per game this season, Rennard has been the Quakers’ most efficient scorer in conference play, shooting 60 percent from the field—including 57 percent from the arc.
Last time out, Penn was able to overcome the absence of the two juniors against Brown, and the Quakers picked up their second conference win of the season on Saturday. Penn started slowly but gradually accumulated momentum on offense, taking the lead by the break and closing out the game with a convincing 71-48 victory.
The Quakers looked towards Cartwright to get it done, and he stepped up, putting up a career-high 28 points and adding seven rebounds. Penn’s defense held the Bears to 23 points in the second half.
As the Quakers look to adapt to the new starting lineup, it remains to be seen whether Cartwright can continue to carry the team. Penn will need another source of offensive production, and the team is looking towards freshman guard Tony Hicks—averaging 12 points per game in conference play. Hicks, who has started three of Penn’s five Ivy League games, was the only other scorer in double digits against Brown with 15 points.
For the next two weekends, the Quakers will be on the road—starting with a stop at Lavietes next Friday.

Originally a 2009 Teach For America Mississippi Delta Corps Member, I am now a fourth-year teacher of low-income and minority students at a public charter high school in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. I would not be a teacher today without the support of TFA, and the majority of my incredible colleagues are Teach For America alumni. My principal—the most effective school leader I have ever witnessed as a teacher or a student—is a TFA alumnus.But February 15 marks the final deadline to apply to be a 2013 TFA Corps Member, and you should not click “submit.”Unfortunately, many TFA alumni (including myself) allow sentimentality to blind us to the harsh practicalities of TFA and its place in the education reform movement. The truth is, TFA teachers within their two-year corps commitment window do not, by and large, have tangible positive impacts on their classrooms. The natural extension is that if you join TFA, you will most likely have a neutral or negative impact on the academic gains of the students that you teach.TFA paints a rosy picture for its prospective applicants when it <a href=""http://www.teachforamerica.org/why-teach-for-america"">glows that TFA corps members enable “students in high-need communities [to] make the academic progress that expands their opportunities.” But this statement isn’t bolstered by fact. TFA is not a traditional teacher-education program. In lieu of obtaining extensive preparation in multi-year undergraduate teacher credentialing programs, TFA corps members complete a five-week training program called “institute” in the summer immediately before they begin teaching. One study on the subject has <a href=""http://www.greatlakescenter.org/docs/Policy_Briefs/Heilig_TeachForAmerica.pdf"">shown that when compared a relatable cohort, teachers in the same schools who are untraditionally prepared and less likely to be certified, novice TFA teachers perform equivalently—but not superior—to those colleagues.This seems disappointing but not terrible. You might not be the next Jaime Escalante (Stand and Deliver, anyone?), but surely you’re not going to de-learn your students as a first-year corps member, right?
Not so fast. Compare the performance of Teach For America corps members to another cohort: credentialed, non-TFA corps members. The same study <a href=""http://www.greatlakescenter.org/docs/Policy_Briefs/Heilig_TeachForAmerica.pdf"">indicates that novice TFA teachers actually perform significantly less well in reading and math than credentialed beginning teachers at the same schools. Keep in mind that to “perform significantly less well” as a teacher is quite literally to have a group of 10, 100, or even 200 students learn less than they would had you not been their teacher.A <a href=""http://www.teachforamerica.org/our-mission/a-solvable-problem"">professed mission of Teach For America when it was founded was to “provide an excellent education for kids in low-income communities,” especially in classrooms staffed by permanent or non-permanent substitutes and “emergency hires.” (My own students’ Algebra I teacher died in the fall before I came, and the students did not see a licensed or credentialed teacher for the rest of the year. Every child was passed on to geometry, yet 91 percent of them failed a low-rigor state Algebra I assessment.) In situations like that, a TFA teacher can be an injection of energy into a “failing” school. In those schools, TFA teachers are no more inadequate than their alternative, and the chance that these corps members might stay past two years and develop into strong teachers is small but worth taking. Unfortunately, these scenarios are becoming less and less frequent.According to the <a href=""http://nepc.colorado.edu/files/PB-TeachAmerica-Heilig.pdf"">study, TFA has been placing teachers outside of those roles that cannot be filled by certified or experienced candidates, in positions that could be filled (or in some cases, were previously filled until rounds of layoffs) by effective, veteran teachers. Although an initial skim of <a href=""http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/pol/tsa.doc"">data released by the U.S. Department of Education reveals a large number of regions suffering from teacher shortages, a closer look reveals that TFA placements are “largely outside” of those highest-need areas. Therefore, the fact that TFA teachers are equally or more effective than their unqualified colleagues becomes irrelevant as we realize that the teachers who were once the inadequate alternative are, in fact, no longer the alternative at all.There is some limited statistical evidence that TFA can be at least marginally impactful. But <a href=""http://www.greatlakescenter.org/docs/Policy_Briefs/Heilig_TeachForAmerica.pdf"">so few TFA teachers stay in the classroom beyond three years (more than 50 percent leave after two years and more than 80 percent leave after three), that the potential positive impact of TFA is rarely felt by the people who matter most—the students. In short, TFA may be pumping alumni who “understand” the achievement gap firsthand into various professions and fields outside of direct instruction, but it is doing so at the academic expense of the highest-risk kids who have the greatest need for effective teachersIf you feel inspired to teach, I beg you: teach! There are young people who need “lifers” committed to powering through the inevitable first three years of being terrible at teaching sinusoidal curves to hormonal 17 year-olds. I encourage you to pursue an alternative route to licensure and placement: one that encourages and actively supports longevity in the classroom and does not facilitate teacher turnover by encouraging its alumni to move into policy or other professions. If you feel compelled to Teach For America instead of teaching for America, please preference a region that has demonstrated a high need for novice teachers due to verifiable teacher shortages. And then stay in the classroom. For a long time. Feel at home teaching, and feel even more at home learning how to get better. Sit. Stay a while. Then stand and deliver.Emma M. Lind '09, an editorial chair emeritus, is a public charter high school teacher in Brooklyn, New York.

Teams of volunteers worked around the clock to keep Cambridge’s homeless population out of harsh weather conditions during a weekend when more than two feet of snow fell on the city of Boston.The student-run Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which is normally open only at night, housed 30 individuals all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, according to Kelly A. Sullivan ’14 and Charles A. Hobbs ’13, who are both administrative coordinators at the shelter.Sullivan said that starting on Thursday night, teams of volunteers from the shelter and government agencies began combing the streets for homeless individuals, warning them of the oncoming storm, telling them where they might find shelter, and distributing passes for the MBTA. Sullivan said that Hurricane Sandy, the last unusually dangerous storm to hit New England, made it apparent that the homeless may be unaware of dangerous conditions even when many are scrambling to prepare for them.“What we realized during Hurricane Sandy was that, even though we had seen Hurricane Sandy all over the news, people on the street may not be hooked up to that kind of information,” Sullivan said.She said that because of building capacity restrictions, the shelter was unable to accommodate extra people, but it did remain open all day. The shelter guaranteed beds throughout the storm for those who stayed on Thursday night and helped arrange transportation for some people to travel to other, larger shelters with more flexible capacities.
“I think it worked fairly well,” Hobbs said. “Nobody came to us in the middle of the night.”Hobbs said that some individuals who were not comfortable staying in the shelter remained outdoors even during the storm.“They’re a whole different challenge,” Hobbs said, adding that volunteers worked to provide those people with blankets, food, and hot drinks. That effort, he said, was based at the First Parish Cambridge Unitarian Universalist Church in Harvard Square.While the shelter’s policy is to stay open all day when the city of Cambridge declares a “snow emergency,” neither Sullivan nor Hobbs could remember a time when it housed people for three full days in a row.“In the four years that I’ve [worked at the shelter], there’s never been a snow event that’s been this large,” Hobbs said. “It was a really crazy weekend for a lot of different reasons.”Hobbs said that he was proud that the shelter was able to keep people out of the storm with “a lot of work from a lot of people.”“Most of the folks who do need shelter—who want shelter—are able to find it,” Hobbs said.—Staff writer Samuel Y.

Harvard’s Office for Sustainability has placed clear, blue, e-waste collection tubes in over 50 locations across campus. The new program strives to increase the degree to which Harvard students recycle smaller, handheld e-waste from laptops, batteries, chargers, and phones that is harder to keep track of than the larger waste already collected by building managers and other personnel.Until now, students, faculty, and other members of the Harvard community have had to submit their smaller e-waste to building managers for proper disposal. The new collection program seeks to imitate e-waste recycling efforts that already exist at the Harvard Divinity School that seek to eliminate the middle man in the recycling process by having easily accessible collection receptacles that quickly fill up with laptop batteries, old phones, and other hazardous waste.“The small, white buckets in building manager’s offices weren’t really conspicuous or noticeable, but we’re hoping that the blue tubes are much more visible and accessible,” said Akshay M. Sharma ’14, freshman yard captain for the Resource Efficiency Program, an undergraduate program under the Office for Sustainability.Once filled, the blue tubes are sent to a sorting facility in Allston where local students from Minuteman Regional High School organize the waste. The students are part of the Career Directions Program of the LABBB Education Collaborative, an initiative that seeks to provide career development skills to students with learning disabilities and developmental delays. In addition to e-waste sorting, the students also help the Office of Sustainability with the organization of books, clothes, and other donated goods, as well as the repair and reassembling of computers.The toxicity of the heavy metals in batteries such as cadmium, mercury, and lead make it illegal to dispose of them in regular trash receptacles.
“If you don’t care about yourself, worry about the birds, bees, and people that are harmed because of contamination in landfills,” said Robert M. Gogan, Harvard’s associate manager for recycling services.Gogan cited the precious metal content of these goods, and the potential to reuse them, as another reason for the program’s importance. Coltan, a material the mining of which is said to fuel the Ituri conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is used to make the tantalum capacitors used in many of the electronic devices collected under the new program.“We need to start collecting the phones because it’s going to be a lot cheaper and better for the people of central Africa if we get Coltan for the new generation of cell phones from the last,” said Gogan.According to Gogan, the e-waste recycling movement at Harvard is set to continue this month with E-cycleMania, a national competition in which Harvard will try to collect more e-waste than other universities. This year, the goal is to collect 500 pounds.—Staff writer Indrani G. Das can be reached at idas@college.harvard.edu.

Nearly two feet of snow coated Harvard’s campus this weekend as winter storm “Nemo” became Boston’s fifth-largest snowstorm on record, with 24.9 inches of snow measured in the city according to official reports.All non-residential University facilities including Harvard’s libraries closed at noon on Friday in compliance with a blizzard warning issued by the National Weather Service. The University shut down all shuttle operations at 3:30 p.m. after Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 declared a state of emergency and banned all non-emergency vehicles from state roads.Harvard Campus Services—which is responsible for facilities upkeep and snow removal—spent Thursday engaged in various activities preparing for the storm, including inspection of energies and utilities, inventory of supplies, and staffing accommodations. According to Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin, employees continued to work throughout the weekend to clear roads and walkways across campus, even during the height of the storm.The statewide road ban, combined with the shutdown of the MBTA Friday afternoon, created a tremendous obstacle for Harvard University Dining Services as staff workers were left stranded on campus and other employees had no way to travel to Harvard and offer relief. As a result many workers who started their days at 6 a.m. on Friday did not leave until Saturday night.According to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin, staff members stayed overnight in hotel rooms and open House dorms to ensure continued service in the dining halls. HUDS reduced its menu offerings and switched to disposable dishware in an effort to cope with the staff shortage.
In many Houses, students and other House residents pitched in and helped out dining workers.In Eliot House, during dinner hours on Saturday, students took shifts volunteering in the back washroom, washing dishes and taking over duties usually covered with ease by a full dining hall staff. Eliot residents Lucy A. Walsh ’15 and Gillian C. Stein ’15 helped sort silverware and stack plates.“The staff has been doing a terrific job and we did not even notice that they were undermanned or struggling,” Walsh said enthusiastically. “But when we heard they could use the help, it was a no-brainer, plus, we thought it could be fun.”Robert W. Lothman ’13 also joined the efforts in Eliot.“Cleaning dishes and taking out the trash are chores I do at home,” he said as he emptied a bag of trash from the dining hall during his impromptu shift. “The dining staff here is so awesome and I would do anything I could to help out.”Others students spent their time during the storm enjoying the snow day in more conventional ways.With intense snowfall and high winds starting Friday afternoon and lasting throughout the night, many students reported that they remained indoors, watching movies, playing games, hanging out with friends, or studying.Though most students could remain warm in their rooms, the heat in much of Ridgley Hall—one of three buildings designated as swing housing during the ongoing renovation of Old Quincy—stopped working on Friday night and was not fixed until the following afternoon, making for a frigid night for its residents.“I noticed it getting pretty chilly in the room early Friday night,” recalled Emma R. Lipshultz ’15. “I didn’t think anything of it until I woke up on Saturday and was freezing, even with two sweatshirts and wool socks on.”Katherine M. Kulik ’15, a Crimson photography editor, told a similar story. Kulik said she and other Ridgley residents tried to stay out of their rooms and enjoy the warmth of the main Quincy House building in rooms like its dining hall and Junior Common Room.

Last Sunday, My Bloody Valentine <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/11/my-bloody-valentine-review/"">released their first album since November 4, 1991, two days before the KGB officially became defunct. The release of ""mbv"" brought them back to immediate relevance, to the delight of their fans. MBV isn't the only band returning to prominence this year, though—here are five other artists coming out of hibernation in 2013.<!--more-->Justin Timberlake—""The 20/20 Experience""Remember when JT was a musician? It seems as though since the release of ""FutureSex / LoveSounds"" in 2006, nobody has really been sure what to call the renaissance man—Musician? Actor? Sean Parker? The recent single ""Suit &amp; Tie"" was a popular success, which bodes well for the album. But the only thing that Timberlake seems to provide with regular certainty is his unfortunate inability to name his tours. ""Justified &amp; Stripped Tour"" and ""FutureSex/LoveShow"" have been the only members of the ""Terribly Titled Timberlake Tours"" list for far too long. We're ready for ""The 20/20 Sexperience.""David Bowie—""The Next Day""The one thing we remember David Bowie doing since his 2001 cameo in ""Zoolander"" is voicing Lord Royal Highness in the Spongebob Squarepants made-for-TV movie ""Atlantis SquarePantis."" This year, though, Bowie is out to prove that he can emerge from a long-kept silence to reassume his iconic role as a controversial, androgynous rock star.
The Avalanches—TBAThe Avalanches released ""Since I Left You"" in 2000 to critical acclaim and have been silent since. The 18-track debut release of weirdly foreign electronic pop left critics and fans desperate for more. Their second album was informally announced in 2005, but it's taken eight years for it to come to fruition. 13 years of silence can change a lot of things—The Avalanches announced via their website that their second album is ""so fuckin' party you will die.""The Knife—""Shaking the Habitual""The Knife haven't exactly been quiet since ""Silent Shout"" in 2006. Singer Karin Dreijer Andersson released an eponymous solo album under the name ""Fever Ray"" in 2009, and she and Olof Dreijer wrote an opera based on Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in 2010. Nonetheless, it's exciting to see The Knife come back together to announce the release of their long-awaited follow-up album. A standout duo birthed from the rich Swedish electronica scene, Karin and Olof often refuse to attend even their own award ceremonies—and when they do appear in public, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymCP6zC_qJU"">they frequently wear carnival masks and creepy makeup.Deltron 3030—""Event II""Deltron 3030 is a supergroup made up of producer Dan the Automator, rapper Del the Funky Homosapien, and DJ Kid Koala. Their eponymous debut, an alternative hip-hopera that detailed Deltron Zero's fight against corporations in the year 3030, was released in 2000 to critical praise. Originally planned for 2007, the release of ""Event II"" has been pushed back countless times—but it seems as though Deltron 3030 is finally ready to release the second installment of their saga. Del has warned fans not to expect an eventual trilogy, so this may be the last we hear of Deltron Zero.

 <span style=""white-space: pre;""> It was an unpredictable road that brought Patrick Douthit––better known as 9th Wonder––from Winston-Salem, North Carolina to lecturing in the Barker Center. That journey took 9th from underground hip-hop darling—via his work with the critically acclaimed group Little Brother—to big-name producer. He has recently worked with Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige. Since 2012, he has held a position as a fellow at The Hiphop Archive at Harvard University, part of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute in African and African American studies department.9th’s talk––entitled “These Are The Breaks,” which comes from the song “The Breaks” by 1980s and 1990s rapper Kurtis Blow––examined the history of hip-hop through the lens of his own relationship to music.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> 9th began by discussing the history of hip-hop culture and also used the music to examine his own life and the songs that inspired him as an artist. Finally, he discussed his own research project, in which he hopes to uncover all the samples used in what he considers the top ten best produced hip-hop albums of all time. To do this, 9th looks at hip-hop like an artist, but also like an archaeologist, examining albums to uncover the samples hidden in plain sight.According to 9th’s lecture, the moment that changed his life forever was when he discovered that the beats behind the hip-hop he loved were based on samples of songs from the 1970s.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> “It is important when you learn that your generation’s music sucks,” he said midway through the talk. This moment of realization triggered a lifelong exploration of the origin of these samples and also prompted a re-examination of the music he listened to as a child.  Most of the talk was biographical, and 9th’s explanation of the history of hip-hop was intertwined with stories from his own life. For example, his description of “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back”––a classic album released in 1988 by the group Public Enemy––was contextualized by his own experience of the album as a 13-year-old. “It introduced me to black leaders. This didn’t come out of the mouth of my teacher, it came out of the mouth of Chuck D,” he said, referring to genre-defining group’s MC.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> In a question-and-answer session after the talk, Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor at Harvard University, likened the act of writers borrowing and adapting from each other to the way hip-hop producers sample from other artists when they construct the beats in their songs. He called this practice “hip-hop intertextuality.” Although 9th didn’t use the same terminology, the theme flowed through most of his talk. He focused a large part of his discussion on “crate digging,” the act of D.J.’s and M.C.’s scouring record stores for songs that contain the best “breaks,” or catchiest bits of the songs. “I am digging for the original tracks that led to the samples in the great hip-hop standards,” 9th said.To illustrate this point, 9th Wonder played the samples––often from soul songs of the 1970s and 1980s––behind some of the great albums of the last two decades, such as Jay Z’s “The Blueprint” and Nas’s “Illmatic,” and examined how the producers used these samples to create the albums’ distinctive sounds.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> However, despite the view often repeated in the media that hip-hop artists are “stealing” the music of their forefathers, 9th explained that what was happening was more of an intergenerational exchange between artists. In fact, he actually has a strong relationship with many of the musicians whose work he samples. “They love us now for sampling, because if we didn’t, the music would die,” he said.For 9th Wonder, the work he is doing makes him more than just a record producer. He sees himself as a not only an artist, but also a mix between educator, curator, and librarian. By joining a growing number of hip-hop artists who have taken academic positions––a list that includes The Roots’ frontman ?uestlove, now a lecturer at New York University––he has a chance to not only validate the artform he loves in the face of generally negative media perception, but to also pay homage to the music that allowed hip hop-to rise in the first place. “We travel the world collecting pieces of history to introduce them to a new generation,” he said.

Au Bon Pain, the bakery and café chain headquartered in Boston, recently <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/22/bon-pain-continues-move-eggs-from-cage-free-hens/A24v6rHsH6DM8ln5hmZmiK/story.html"">announced that it would completely eliminate eggs from hens raised in battery cages and pork from pigs bred in gestation crates from its U.S. supply chain by 2017. The move, along with similar measures announced by prominent companies like McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, and Costco, points to the increasing success of consumer activism in bringing about positive, ethical change and the growing success of the food movement.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Battery cages that house birds in less space than a <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-05-29/lifestyle/35458579_1_gestation-pork-industry-temple-grandin"">sheet of paper and gestation crates so small that the sows cannot even <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/business/pig-farmers-face-pressure-on-the-size-of-the-sty.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">turn around are unnecessarily cruel. In both cases, the severe lack of space <a href=""http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/hsus-a-comparison-of-the-welfare-of-hens-in-battery-cages-and-alternative-systems.pdf"">causes sores, stress, and disease in the animals, making them among the most inhumane practices in factory farming. These intensive confinement systems are so inhumane that they have been banned in a growing number of U.S. states and European nations (in the case of battery cages, in the entire European Union). Additionally, factory farming systems like battery cages and gestation crates are documented environmental hazards. Eliminating the cramped conditions may also enhance food safety, a consideration that has prompted prominent consumer advocacy groups like the Center for Food Safety to oppose battery cages and gestation crates.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Many food retailers such as Wal-Mart, Safeway, and Trader Joe’s have also announced that they will transition to cage-free eggs. Harvard <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/19/eggs-cage-free-huds/"">transitioned to 100 percent cage-free eggs in 2011, but unfortunately, no efforts to eliminate pork raised in gestation crates from its dining menus have been made. In addition, our own Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a <a href=""http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cityClerk/PolicyOrder.cfm?action=search&amp;item_id=18825"">resolution calling on all restaurants in the city to switch to cage-free eggs in 2007. These reforms signal a rapid increase in much-needed consumer attention to the ethics of food production in an era of mass industrialization. In the absence of meaningful regulation from our nation’s notoriously scant federal animal welfare laws, we encourage more businesses, both in the Boston area and at large, to follow suit and end their financial support of unethical farming practices.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> While critics may contend that movements for cage-free eggs and gestation crate-free pork are needlessly costly, research has been <a href=""https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Reports/Documents/sow_housing_tfr.pdf"">inconclusive on the economics of gestation crates. In addition, the increased consumer preference for humanely produced foods will draw more suppliers, attracted by the allure of profitability, that will help to decrease current prices. Most compellingly, the agriculture industry cannot justifiably employ ethically and environmentally indefensible practices in pursuit of additional profit. ABP’s reforms are well worth the small additional costs of their implementation.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> The writing is on the wall for companies and suppliers still relying on battery cages and gestation crates. The impact of the food movement is accelerating, and increasing pressure will be placed on businesses to comply with growing consumer demands for ethically sourced food. If not from their own sense of responsibility, businesses should move toward humane treatment of animals in adherence to the age-old maxim: The customer is always right.

Junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu broke the Ivy League record in the women’s weight throw at the annual HYP track and field meet this past weekend in Princeton, N.J.  Her winning throw of 20.11 meters makes her the first woman in Ivy League history to break the 20-meter mark.Ekechukwu’s performance helped the Crimson to a second-place finish in the meet with 55 points. Princeton won with a total of 79 points, and Yale finished third with 25.The women’s weight throw featured a showdown between Ekechukwu and the freshman standout from Princeton, Julia Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe, the record holder in her home country of New Zealand, set a personal best of 19.74 meters, but it was no match for Ekechukwu, who broke the record on the first of her five attempts with a 20.03-meter toss. The junior’s third attempt was her best of the day, as she turned in her record-breaking third throw of 20.11 meters.“I knew who my competitor was,” Ekechukwu said. “[Julia Ratcliffe], on the Princeton team, who has been having a very good indoor season as well. I just came in with a very competitive mindset. I was ready to go after her.”Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, dominated last year’s HYP meet at Harvard, beating her next closest competitor by more than two meters. However, Ratcliffe held the Ivy League record coming into this year’s HYP meet, having set it at 19.69 meters earlier this year at the Princeton Quad Meet on Jan. 16.
“I knew she was going to be a good competitor,” Ekechukwu said. “But my coach was telling me that it is not really good to be going after numbers…. So while I was expecting to put up a fight against her it wasn’t really my main concern. I was just concerned with doing well for myself and doing well for my team.”Head coach Jason Saretsky acknowledged the competition between the junior and freshman, and was glad to see Ekechukwu get the better of Ratcliffe.“Adabelle has certainly stepped up to that challenge [from Ratcliffe],” Saretsky said. “And she’s done a remarkable job not only matching her, but surpassing her.”First-year throwing coach Andrew Dubs has only been working with the team since September, when he took over for Cathrine Eriksen, who is now the director of cross country and track and field at Northeastern. In this short period of time, Dubs has had a strong impact on the Harvard throwers, Ekechukwu in particular.“I was just really pleased with Adabelle and the way she performed and competed,” Dubs said. “She was very focused all day leading up to the meet and she was on fire once the competition started.”After its performance this weekend, the Crimson now look ahead to the Heptagonal Championships set to take place at Gordon Indoor Track Feb. 23 and 24th.“I think it was good that Adabelle was able to get the first strike in there with her victory.” Dubs said. “Now hopefully we can duplicate that in a couple weeks and come out on top.”The junior is also looking forward to the opportunity to compete at her home track.“I am just excited for the crowds that will be there,” Ekechukwu said. “I am excited for the energy that the women’s team is going to bring, and I am just excited for my teammates to do well in general.”As the competition approaches, Dubs knows Ekechukwu won’t lose focus in practice.“It is a pleasure to come to work everyday, and to go to practice with her,” Dubs said. “She is very dedicated and a very hard worker, just a pleasure to be around.”Though he was pleased with Ekechukwu’s record-breaking performance, Saretsky thinks the future may be even brighter for his junior co-captain.“[Ekechukwu] has been ready for this for a while now,” Saretsky said,” So it was fantastic to see things finally click…. I still think there’s more to come [from her].”While these may seem like lofty expectations, Saretsky believes that Ekechukwu has what it takes to excel both in the Ivy League and beyond.""She’s got all the things you look for in a national-caliber thrower,” Saretsky said. “She’s got a great work-ethic. She’s fast, explosive, and extremely strong. All the tools that you look for, she’s got. And the most important part of it is the heart. She really is passionate about what she does and is really committed to this.""

Adabelle Ekechukwu’s stellar record-breaking weight throw won the junior co-captain of the women’s track and field team our Athlete of the Week honor, but several other athletes also had performances worthy of recognition by The Back Page.
Emerance Maschmeyer, Women’s Hockey
In last week’s Beanpot women’s semi-final, the freshman goalie made a career-high 34 saves, shattering her previous high of 22. Despite her best efforts, the Crimson still came up short as Boston College won by a 2-1 margin.  Maschmeyer had a save percentage of .944, consistent with her season mark of .940, despite the fact that she was under fire far more against the No. 2 ranked Eagles than she has been all season. Throughout the first two periods, the goalkeeper managed to hold Boston College scoreless, quickly racking up more saves than in any of her previous games before the final period even began. In the third period, however, the Eagles managed to score twice to secure the win in a hotly contested game. Maschmeyer is now 7-2 on the season, splitting starts with senior Laura Bellamy (10-1-1).
Victoria Lippert, Women’s Basketball
On Sunday afternoon, the senior led Harvard’s women’s basketball team to an important overtime victory over Ivy League rival Cornell. Lippert was incredibly impressive on the offensive end, turning in an immensely efficient performance while leading Harvard in points with 19. She shot six for 11 from the floor (55%) and six for six on free throws. Thirteen of her points came in the second half, when she scored over half of the Crimson’s points as the game went into overtime. The guard also added four offensive rebounds to round off an 69-point offensive effort. Lippert has started every game this season for the Crimson and is second on the team in points per game (12.5).
Marshall Everson, Men’s Hockey 
The Harvard men’s hockey team ended its eight game losing streak on Sunday with a 1-1 tie against Dartmouth thanks to an important goal by its senior leader. Down by a goal after Dartmouth scored in the first period, the forward came back and scored a power-play goal to tie the game and end the skid. He was assisted on the play by senior Alex Fallstrom and sophomore Colin Blackwell. Everson is second on the team in goals with five and has played in every game this season.

Next weekend, the Harvard community will have the chance to hear a diverse array of talented vocalists. Every year during Black History Month, the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College—a choir that celebrates black creativity and spirituality—host the Dr. Walter J. Leonard Black Arts Festival. While the focus of the celebration is Black heritage and art, those who are neither black nor artists need not despair as the weekend-long festival is intended for a diverse audience. “Black history is American history,” says Tsega Tamene ’15, the chair of the Black Arts Festival and a singer in Kuumba. “You don’t have to be black. You don’t have to come from that story or history to acknowledge and celebrate it. The week and festival are for all students.”This year, the theme of the festival is “Voices,” and Kuumba has taken this to heart in designing their inclusive and celebratory schedule of events. “Black in the Day,” Kuumba’s main concert, will be the centerpiece of the festivities. The performance is a variety show that will feature everything from Kuumba’s signature choral style to hip-hop dances to live jazz tributes. In honor of Black History month, each performer or group will also dedicate their piece to an iconic figure in Black arts. “The goal of the performance is to showcase some of the voices that have existed through history that have made Black art what it is today,” Kuumba President Danitra J. Wansley ’13 says.“Black in the Day” is just one of the many events scheduled for the Black Arts Festival, which also includes “What is Hip-Hop? Black Voice in Popular Media,” a panel discussion, and “Sing It, Sister!,” a showcase of Black women in the arts. “Sometimes I think Black history is made too serious a thing, and obviously there is a certain tone to a lot of Black history. But a lot of it is just about fun, creativity, and getting down, and that’s what this showcase is about,” Tamene says.

Nearly two decades ago, the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra’s critically acclaimed recording of Mahler’s Symphony No. 6 skyrocketed the orchestra to international fame and even inspired renowned Mahler reviewer Tony Duggan to say that the infamous hammer blows at the end of the piece were the best he had ever heard. Nineteen years later, the symphony will once more be brought to life under the baton of BPO conductor Benjamin Zander, this time at Sanders Theatre on Feb. 21 and Feb. 24.For its upcoming concerts, the BPO will use a timpani crate and a plumber’s pipe to create the three terrifying hammer blows that occur towards the end of the piece. These blows represent three premonitions or “great blows of fate” that Mahler had, according to legend, foreseen: the loss of his job, the death of his daughter (who passed away at age four), and the discovery of the heart condition that ultimately caused his death. While most conductors, including Mahler himself, would excise the third blow from his performances because they considered playing it to be a bad omen, Zander plans to include it in the BPO’s performance. “Now that [Mahler’s] gone, I don’t have to be concerned about it,” he says. “I’m not afraid.”The conductor, who considers the dark and dramatic Mahler 6 to be one of the greatest pieces ever composed, looks forward not only to revisiting the piece for himself but also to introducing the symphony to a new generation of listeners. In pursuit of this goal, he will be giving a lecture on the piece before the Sunday performance. “We cannot expect people to be trained in music and understand complicated, long pieces without a little help. I make it my job to explain each piece, since audiences need to be brought into the experience,” Zander says. “The audience has to bring all of their experiences of their own life to the listening…. This could really be a life-changing experience for some.”Understandably, when the BPO announced that it would again perform the very piece that put it on the map, much of the Boston musical community began to buzz with excitement and curiosity. Despite his experience with the piece, Zander feels the weight of this recognition and of the piece itself. “I’m a little scared of the piece,” Zander says. “I’m scared of the emotional intensity and physical effort. I’m in awe of it.” He estimates that over 2,000 tickets have already been sold for the three performances, but he still hopes that more Harvard students will attend the concert and lecture. “People come to Harvard for extraordinary experiences,” Zander says. “This is one of them.”—Staff writer Connie Yan can be reached at connieyan@college.harvard.edu.

In the last decade alone, China has transformed into the site of a dynamic art scene. Adrian Gordon, a photographer who was born in China but now works in New York, has attempted to document the recent social shifts in her native country through photography. A selection of her work entitled, “Zhuaji: Photographs of China,” is on display until the end of April at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> On Wednesday, her photographs were the subject of a frank conversation among art critics and historians about the realities of contemporary China.  Gordon participated in a panel discussion about photographing China with several faculty members from Harvard.  Professor of Asian Art Eugene Wang moderated the panel, which consisted of Boston-based photographer Kris Snibbe, Professor of Photography and chair of the department of History of Art and Architecture Robin E. Kelsey, Professor of History of Art and Architecture and of Visual and Environmental Studies Carrie Lambert-Beatty, MIT Associate Professor of Architectural History Arindam Dutta, and junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows Winnie Wong. Gordon recounted her childhood in China and talked with the panel about the significance of her photographs. She said that she hoped to present an “unpackaged” portal into China through her photographs. “I’m interested in imagined futures [in China] that you can no longer imagine,” Gordon said. Wang agreed that Gordon had a unique desire to photograph China. “[She had an] urge to go there with a camera to look for things that may have vanished, to capture and imagine things,” Wang said.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Gordon said her childhood was spent playing with cameras. One of her playmates was Liu Xiaobo, a currently imprisoned Chinese critic, writer, and human rights activist. “[Gordon’s] unique perspective propelled her to create a documentary and imaginative inquiry into the China of her birth,” Wang said. The panel discussed the original approach that Gordon has taken to China. Neither a tourist nor a conventional foreigner, Gordon says her understanding of China springs from her upbringing and background. <span style=""white-space: pre;""> “I wanted to portray the personal ghosts of a China that doesn’t exist anymore,” Gordon said. The urban-rural dichotomy of China is a major theme in her photographs, which  feature subjects that sweep the gamut from shopping malls and city streets to the open fields of the Dulong River Valley on the border between China and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. “I wanted to juxtapose the whiteness, wealth and luxury of these shopping malls against the rural openness of the country,” Gordon said.  Architecture historian Dutta focused on the use of diagonals in the photographs of urban environment. “[This creates] the feeling of being displaced inside this environment of sheer interiority,” he said. 
<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Professional photographer Wong marveled at the scope of the exhibit. “[Gordon is] showing all of China, and in particular, Hong Kong and Macau, and how it is culturally and politically and socially distinct but of the same China,” she said. Art historians Wang, Kelsey, and Lambert-Beatty spoke of how the work echoed that of other artists, such as photographer Robert Frank, documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman, and pioneering photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson. “There are certain tropes and historical moments embedded in the photographs [of Gordon],” Wong said. Panelists situated the work within current trends of photography and critical interpretation, mentioning how Gordon reflects current developments in participatory photography and shifts away from what Lambert-Beatty called “overly critical gestures.”<span style=""white-space: pre;""> “The [contemporary] critique is losing its valency. What is more powerful in a way are the imagined futures that bewilder and pose questions,” Lambert-Beatty said. Gordon was quick to stress that her photos were not altered or manipulated using digital editing software, launching a conversation about authenticity and the struggle for it in both contemporary China and its art. Wang placed this debate within a sociopolitical context.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> “[The] photographic medium [is] a democratizing force, with the deskilling and availability of easy snapshots,” said Wang. These comments led panelists into a discussion of China’s political future and the effect of increased exposure to mass social media and globalization on Chinese society. When Gordon was asked about her aspirations for the exhibit, she said, “I hope it raises questions and that people can resist the impulse to read into it an overarching argument. I hope it brings up a conversation.”<span style=""white-space: pre;""> At once inquisitive and candid, Gordon’s exhibition evokes the vivid colors of China and harks back to past documentarian images of China taken by Western photogrpahers. It suggests that documentary art can serve as more than an anthropological record for a moment in society, but that it can be an instrument for political activism and criticism.

Disaster was the theme of Monday night’s City Council meeting, as councillors reviewed Cambridge’s blizzard response and recalled last fall’s city-wide blackout.The Council stressed the need for Cantabrigians to be patient this week, as the city embarks on the blizzard cleanup process. Hoping to ease the burden on Cantabrigians, the Council also adopted an order asking City Manager Robert W. Healy to waive parking fees at the First Street Garage this week.Both Councillor Marjorie C. Decker and Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that constituents had contacted them during the blizzard to report streets that the Department of Public Works had not plowed. The two councillors also commended city employees for their diligence during the storm.“Our city employees probably hear more of the complaints that come through rather than the thanks that they deserve,” Decker said.Mayor Henrietta J. Davis also praised the Department of Public Works for its storm response. Acknowledging that the response might have seemed slow to some Cantabrigians, she added, “The crews do have to sleep.”
Decker also expressed her appreciation for Cambridge residents’ patience and cooperation during the storm.“I just would like to thank our residents for doing the backbreaking work of clearing their sidewalks,” she said.The Council also turned its attention to last November’s city-wide blackout as part of a larger conversation about concerns with NSTAR Electric and Gas, the city’s electricity provider. Councillors said that several Cambridge businesses had found the utility company unable to meet their ampage needs.“We ought to be concerned about the adequacy of the infrastructure that NSTAR has,” said Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72. Reeves cited the “bedlam” that ensued in Central Square during the Nov. 29 blackout as evidence of the immediacy of the problem.Kelley deemed it “ironic” that the Council was approving large-scale development plans in Cambridge while problems with NSTAR persisted.“We ought to know more about NSTAR’s capacity before encouraging further building,” he said.The Council ultimately adopted an order requesting that the City Manager meet with NSTAR officials. The order, sponsored by Reeves and Councillor Leland Cheung, called for a “firm timeline for maintenance and replacement plans.”—Staff writer Sonali Y.

The plot of Jules Massenet’s opera “Cinderella” centers around the same elements as that of the Disney movie everyone grew up with: a girl, a godmother, a glass slipper. What people might not recognize from their childhood version, in the opera however, are iPhone selfies, Juicy Couture tracksuits, and the “bend and snap” from “Legally Blonde.” But that is exactly what you get with Dunster House Opera’s production, which runs through Saturday in Dunster Dining Hall. With incredible wit and fantastic musical performances across the board, the show maintains all the charm of the original story while updating the comical theatrics and costumes.Director Katherine E. Moon ’14 gives a modern, playful spin on the classic, providing a tongue-in-cheek parody of modern culture where most viewers are expecting the comfortable familiarity of an age-old fairy tale. The effect is to make the opera more accessible—the two stepsisters (Olivia R. Miller ’16 and Julia I. Biedry ’16), are armed with a brace of Sephora bags and prance about the stage practicing duck faces, while the group of tailors, with their flowing scarves and deep v-necks, recall contemporary hipsters. By playing up these comic elements, Moon has turned a night at the opera, which can seem stodgy and humorless to those less acquainted with the genre, into a light and fun theatrical experience.Though entirely run by students, the show is marked by the utmost professionalism. All of the elements of the production create a harmonious, balanced whole: nowhere does the orchestra overpower the singers, as so often happens with student productions. Instead, actors and musicians perform in lockstep, working together to convey a dynamic, human side of characters we know so well—after Cinderella flees as the stroke of midnight nears, the prince sings of losing hope that he will ever see his love again, and the cellos echo his despair in their melancholy flourishes.The central pairing—Cinderella (Amelia H. Ross ’14) and Prince Charming (Allison A. Ray ’14)—provides the opera with a solid emotional core. The fact that the prince is played by a woman may seem like a modern twist, but in fact Massenet originally intended for the part to be played by a soprano. While some productions use a tenor instead, DHO’s decision to have a female prince was the right one. Ray is perfectly suited to the part, with a strikingly beautiful, gentle voice that gives depth to her character. The prince is introduced in a scene where he refuses to get dressed, but the next scene, in which Ray sings affectingly of his loneliness, develops sympathy for her character. And Ross, a talented singer in her own right who so affectingly conveys Cinderella’s anguish in her first scenes, is a perfect match for Ray. The dream scene in which they serenade each other, with the Fairy Godmother’s (Liv A. Redpath ’14) voice floating above their intertwining promises of love, is one of the most magical of the performance.As the stepmother, Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 steals the show with her diva-esque take on her role—she chews gum while singing her arias, brandishes a stiletto heel at her harried husband, and even winks creepily at the audience like Lucille Bluth from “Arrested Development.” But Leimkuhler’s theatrics are not designed to compensate for any lackluster singing—she manages to maintain her imperious, sneering air while expertly navigating the difficult notes. At several points during the show, she comically shoves others out of the way so that she can be at the center of attention, but she hardly needs to: her mere presence is enough. If Ray and Ross, with their delicate, heartfelt duets, preserve the essence of Massenet’s original, Leimkuhler’s theatrics give the production a humorous spark and a modern twist.
Redpath, as the Fairy Godmother, gives another exquisite performance. Her voice is sweet and graceful, and she hops with ease from high note to high note. The only hiccup is the floppy, oversized set of wings she wears, which undercut her elegance and distract from her vocal feats. For a production that is otherwise so self-assured in its novel interpretations, this foray into literalism is unnecessary. Costume designer Juliet M. Snyder ’15 dressed all of the other characters in creative modern outfits, so the Fairy Godmother’s garb felt inconsistent with her overall vision.Still, with the only criticism something as minor as a pair of wings, the overall production is a fantastically successful reinterpretation of a classic fairy tale.

The nomination of John O. Brennan as director of the Central Intelligence Agency has renewed a national debate on the role of predator drones in war. Brennan’s nomination reflects President Obama’s steadfast support for these unmanned aircraft. Just last week, a highly controversial Justice Department <a href=""http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf"">memo detailing the legal justification for these drone strikes was leaked to NBC News. The document sanctions the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be a “senior operational leader” of Al-Qaeda, even <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/02/05/justice-department-chilling-drone-white-paper/"">without intelligence indicating an imminent threat to the country. This has led to issues on the potential legality of these killings, not to mention the ethical ramifications of such attacks. But what place do drones have in our society? The public needs to have a serious discussion about a potential legal framework for their use through the establishment of both international and domestic law.It is easy to think about drone warfare as a uniquely American phenomenon, but that is far from the truth. <a href=""mailto:http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/19/opinion/cortright-droneshttp://www.cnn.com/2011/10/19/opinion/cortright-drones"">According to CNN, up to 50 nations currently have or are developing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, in addition to a number of non-state actors such as Hezbollah. As the U.N. Charter already <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/392756/Legality_of_Targeted_Killings_by_Drone_Attacks_in_Pakistan"">outlaws “arbitrary killings,” not to mention civilian ones, drone strikes constitute <a href=""mailto:http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un"">a severe threat to the integrity of international law. It is the responsibility of the United Nations, which has a unique ability to enact a system of international accountability, to curb the use of drones. While it may seem an unenviable task to convince the world’s most powerful nation to disarm itself of a crucial weapon, it should be no more difficult than convincing the United States to sign nuclear non-proliferation treaties (<a href=""mailto:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons"">1968) or chemical weapons treaty (<a href=""mailto:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention"">1997), especially if other nations continue to expand their own rival programs.Of course, any international deal would be far easier if the United States were to first develop legal guidelines of its own, which could possibly serve as a framework for international negotiations. The U.S. needs to develop an effective balance between efficient systems of eliminating targets and respect for the constitutional rights of terrorists, whatever they may be. Setting current legal issues aside, it is clear that Americans <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2013/02/07/liberals_love_drones_too/"">support the use of drone strikes to target terrorists. However, it is also clear that <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/233175-house-republican-proposes-ban-on-use-of-armed-drones-in-the-us"">bipartisan support does exist for its regulation. Though neither Democrats nor Republicans will support total prohibition on the use of armed drones, both would <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/drone-support-poll_n_2647051.htmlhttp:/www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/drone-support-poll_n_2647051.html"">support regulations on their use against American citizens, specifically through judicial or congressional oversight of the program.The first thing that Congress needs to do is establish a legal framework for the constitutional rights of terrorists. Though U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-03-05/eric-holder-killing-us-citizens-terrorist-threat/53374776/1"">maintains that the Constitution does not cover terrorists, the Supreme Court <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamdi_v_rumsfeld"">declared in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that U.S. citizens have the right of due process under law. Currently, the government is making the case that this only <a href=""http://billmoyers.com/2013/02/06/breaking-down-the-drone-memo/"">applies to detained terrorists rather than those on the battlefield. Therefore, congressional Democrats have some leeway to enact legislation.In exchange for the legalization of the targeting of U.S. citizens, Democrats could concede a system of judicial oversight on specific killings. Though the details of such proceedings—including the names of those on the “kill list”—would not necessarily have to be public, its mere occurrence would go a long way toward maintaining the stability of the legal process. To further ensure transparency and the efficacy of this program, some or all details could be released a certain period after the killing of the given target, either to a congressional committee or to the public at large. This mix of executive orders and congressional and judicial overview would sustain America’s system of checks and balances while still maintaining the confidential nature of the war on terror.
It is also imperative that Congress pass a more general system of regulations on who—specifically, which U.S. citizens—may be targeted through drone strikes. One such regulation could require that targets pose an “imminent” threat to the United States—though <a href=""mailto:http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/obamas-memo-on-killing-americans-twists-imminent-threat-like-bush/272862/"">the meaning of the word ""imminent"" may have to be clarified. Reform of the United States’ internal drone program can lead to leverage with Pakistan, on whose soil America continually targets enemy combatants. Ideally, this would strengthen Pakistan’s tenuous cooperation in the war on terror.The United States has a right and responsibility to eliminate terrorists that pose a threat to our national security. However, we must ensure that first and foremost our Constitution is upheld and that we act within our bounds, specifically when dealing with U.S. citizens. We must also learn to cooperate with the rest of the world on this sensitive issue. Predator drones can be great tools in the war on terror, but it is our responsibility to establish their roles and limitations.Julian Atehortua ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, is an economics concentrator in Leverett House.

Music curator and producer Francis Falceto is best known for having brought late-20th century Ethiopian music to a wider audience. He is the acclaimed producer of the 27-volume “Ethiopiques” CD series that began in 1997, and he is also the author of the 2001 book “Abyssinie Swing: A Pictorial History of Modern Ethiopian Music” and director of the 1996 documentary film “Abyssinie Swing.” Falceto has dedicated his life to sharing and preserving the legacy of Ethiopian music, and he shared his insight on the genre  as the keynote speaker of the “Africa Remix: Producing and Presenting African Musics Abroad” conference at the Mahindra Humanities Center on Friday.The Harvard Crimson: What drew you to Ethiopian music? And what about it led you to bring it to the world stage?Francis Falceto: I’m a music lover. The day I met this music just by chance was…amazing. I knew quite a lot about various music from Africa, but I had never heard that. And because my sickness is to share what I like, I decided to first go to Ethiopia and then invite [internationally recognized Ethiopian musician] Mahmoud Ahmed—it was then 1985—to perform. You enjoy your music, you understand it is not known—it has not reached our shores, to say—and because you are involved with some friends in promoting music, you decide to make it happen.THC: How has the landscape of Ethiopian music changed during your time as a producer?FF: From the 20th century until now, the change in Ethiopian music [has been] tremendous. This builds the question: what is tradition? Something static? Is it something dynamic? Does it evolve slowly? Quickly? Through where and why? And how does it come? Now, it’s been about 30 years that I have been very close to Ethiopian music, and I can see on the traditional and modern aspect the evolution is very impressive. In Ethiopia, there are many, many different kinds of music related to different people from different backgrounds. One of the major musics [of Ethiopia] is the music of minstrels. It used to [be] people wandering over the country. After the revolution, they started to open their own cabarets, instead of passing by and getting money. They became settlers in the city. There was transformation in the music, the costumes, and the audience.The [original] big bands were disbanded when the revolution came in, and the electronic keyboard came in massively. Everybody thought the electronic keyboard could replace the band, for economical reasons. But artistically speaking, it has affected terribly the look and the shape of the music. On the other hand, cassette...is cheap and not very fragile and is very democratic in the sense that you don’t need appliances like a turntable or electricity, where you can only listen in the city; with cassettes, just with batteries, you can listen to music in the deep countryside.... Now [Ethiopian music] is trying to rebuild, to become as exciting as it was a half century ago.THC: Did you expect the acclaim that “Ethiopiques” has received?FF: I had no idea the response would be so nice. For me it is a verification of the first time I listened, that this is great music. And it is one of the last musics of Africa to reach our shores, our ears, [and] our turntables. And I enjoy [seeing] it shared by people of every continent.THC: Given some of the negative stereotypes that exist about the welfare of Africa, do you feel that your work has changed the perception of Ethiopia?FF: That is true that the image of Ethiopia is terrible from abroad. After 1984, everybody began looking at Ethiopia as a poor country with people lining up as refugees. But it is cliché. Probably on a very modest dimension, “Ethiopiques” may have been able to change this a bit. That is why I include pictures [in the volumes]…. When you see the big band of people in very elegant tuxedos…you have to forget about your clichés. I hope I have been able to help change the image, but I’m afraid there is still a lot to do.

As far as much of Generation Y is concerned, only old cranks complain about the rise of online communications and media. Sure, a Facebook message isn’t as personal as a telephone call, nor is Wikipedia as reliable as Britannica. But what took two hours in 1980 often takes only two minutes today. We are infinitely more efficient at many things, and when one looks at the upsides of the computer age, the argument goes, the downsides are trivial. Of course, this theory has its share of dissidents. Among them is author James Ladsun, who writes about his suffering at the hands of an online stalker—a self-styled “verbal terrorist” on whom he bestows the pseudonym “Nasreen”—who wants nothing more than to “ruin him.” Whereas the Internet has become a source of unprecedented convenience for many, for Ladsun it has become a source of infinite torment.In his memoir “Give Me Everything You Have,” Ladsun cleverly catalogs his tormentor’s diabolical methods: her tweaks of his Wikipedia entry, her malicious reviews of his works on Amazon, and her tech-savvy scheme of forwarding inappropriate articles from his email address to academic colleagues, just to name a few. Ladsun also goes on a psychological journey, trying to make sense of his predicament while dissecting Nasreen’s potential motives. The contrast he creates between a victim who wants nothing more than to be left alone and the rage of an imbalanced anti-heroine is compelling; its inherent salaciousness makes Ladsun’s fate salient and effectively warns of the Internet’s dark possibilities. But while the author earns our sympathy through his well-described tribulations, he also abuses it through endless asides, obscure literary allusions, and garish prose that undermine his directive.Ladsun’s tale, to summarize, begins in 2003 when Nasreen enrolled in a college-level creative writing course that he was teaching in New York City. A shy, introverted Iranian-American woman, Nasreen had begun to write a novel following the exploits of an upper-crust family in Tehran in the ’70’s. Her classmates were mildly impressed by the tale, but Ladsun was downright stirred. “Her language was clear and vigorous,” Ladsun writes, and he describes her prose as possessing a “distinct fiery expressiveness…that made it a pure pleasure to read.”After the semester ended, Ladsun and Nasreen became enmeshed in their own writing projects and fell out of contact. Then, in 2005, Nasreen emailed Ladsun with a draft of her novel, hoping to receive some advice on the publishing process. This correspondence quickly transformed into a flurry of online chats, and Ladsun is forthcoming about how he enjoyed the exoticism, the “novelty” of his young, Persian amie de plume. Soon, however, Nasreen’s emails became too explicit and too indicative of psychological imbalance for Ladsun to ignore. She ranted about her colleagues with inappropriate vigor, offered to model her body for Ladsun’s enjoyment, and began sending him flirtatious pictures of herself.He rebuffed her, left her emails unanswered for weeks at a time, and suggested that she seek counseling. Nasreen, in response, grew hostile. At first, she would only prod Ladsun—suggest he’d had affairs with past students or accuse him of disinterest in her literary pursuits. But her hatred of the man soon mushroomed, as did the absurdity of her claims. She came to imply that he drugged and raped her, and she accused him of founding a Jewish literary “cartel.” Soon, she had completed her transformation from a promising young wordsmith into a monomaniacal stalker.
Ladsun could have used this experience to reflect upon the technological conditions that make Nasreen’s “verbal terrorism” possible, and occasionally, he does. But the problem with these reflections is that they often segue into a series of unrelated side-tales that connect only peripherally to the topic at hand. In one of his more lengthy asides, Ladsun details a journey across America by train. He reflects extensively upon the strip sprawl of Chicagoland; he indulges in a long conversation with an innocent Boy Scout who has never left Kansas; he describes his travels in New Mexico as a literary tourist. Later in the novel, he explores Jerusalem on a journalistic assignment, discusses the Six-Day War, and investigates the history of the twice-destroyed Hurva temple. At some points, he strays so far from the core narrative that it seems he needs reminding that his life is not as interesting to the general public as it is to his stalker.These lengthy asides often evolve into discussions of literature. “Macbeth,” “Othello,” “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” and the works of Lawrence, Coleridge, and Plath come up in the course of his introspections. He quotes many at length—even his own poetry at one point—and he dedicates pages to rehashing plotlines. These glimpses into a literary mind are interesting to an extent, but when Ladsun dusts off a collection of Heidegger’s essays while interpreting Nasreen’s enraged references to Rilke, or quotes “Gawain” in its original Middle English while dissecting Isaac Bashevis Singer’s “The Penitent,” the text comes across as too self-important, which detracts from the naturally compelling story of conflict happening in his day-to-day existence. Ladsun continually refocuses the narrative, but not before surveying an esoteric collection of loosely related fictions.However, even when Ladsun does directly discuss his nemesis and her manipulation of technology, the pretentious, pseduo-literary framework of the novel lends itself to equally pretentious prose. Ladsun often indulges in cumbersome adverbial phrases such as “sententiously though, in light of the catastrophe that later unfolded, with odd clairvoyance,” and clunkily strings together adjectives as in “one of those avuncular, rather eunuchy types.” Certain passages, such as those of the Western landscape during his trans-Atlantic journey, are succinct and stirring, but these segments are the exception.“Give Me Everything You Have” is essentially a memoir coated in literary fat. The wearisome prose, the arcane references, and the endless asides too often drown the narrative. The compelling tale of a malevolent, unbalanced antagonist using uniquely modern tools to attack the author is there; uncovering it may be a rewarding experience, but rest assured, it’ll take some digging.—Staff writer J.

Five years after <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/11/hms-professor-files-gender-bias-lawsuit/"">filing a gender discrimination lawsuit against Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School professor Carol A. Warfield has reached a $7 million settlement with the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital. Observers say that the agreement, which also stipulates that the hospital rename its pain center in Warfield’s honor, is one of the largest gender discrimination settlements ever to be publicly disclosed in Massachusetts.Warfield, who sits on the Harvard Medical School faculty and was the first woman with an endowed chair at the Medical Center, filed a lawsuit in March of 2008 alleging gender discrimination and retaliation on the part of hospital leadership.Ellen J. Zucker, Warfield’s attorney, said that along with the settlement payment, the renaming of the pain center, and compensation for lost income, the hospital has also agreed to sponsor an annual lecture series on women’s contributions to surgery. In addition, it will “reaffirm and...clarify its policies and procedures to ensure that all employees have mechanisms available to them to raise concerns about discrimination and retaliation,” Zucker said.A joint statement released last week by the involved parties said that, while they have “resolved their differences,” the defendants, who include former Medical Center Chief of Surgery Josef E. Fischer and former Medical Center president and CEO Paul F. Levy, admit no wrongdoing on their parts. Levy and Fischer’s attorney Richard D. Glovsky both declined requests for comment on the case Monday afternoon.Warfield’s 2008 complaint alleged that over a period of years Fischer disrespected Warfield—who was then the chair of the hospital’s anesthesia department—and her female colleagues, The complaint also claimed that Levy failed to address the discrimination complaints brought forward by Warfield. Despite additional complaints to hospital leadership and an investigation of Fischer’s and Warfield’s relationship which found fault with Fischer, the misconduct allegedly continued, and Warfield was dismissed from her chair position in July 2007.
The defendants attempted to keep the matter in arbitration, but the Suffolk Superior Court denied that request and <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/9/18/harvard-medical-school-prof-gender-bias/"">sent the dispute to trial. The trial would have began last week had the settlement not been reached. In the joint statement, the hospital’s General Counsel Jamie Katz said that the hospital is pleased that the matter has been resolved and looks forward to serving the community—a goal shared by Warfield and the rest of the hospital’s staff.“This case serves as a reminder that, with time and consideration, people of goodwill can learn from one another,” Katz said in the statement.Zucker said that the settlement was “enormously gratifying.”“It’s an unusual resolution, because it was not just about damages, a sum of money, and everyone going their separate ways,” Zucker said.Warfield, who joined the Medical Center’s staff in 1980, called the hospital “an institution I’ve loved for the past 35 years,” and said she hopes the outcome of her case could help other Medical Center staff and faculty.“I’m really heartened by the fact that the hospital has taken this opportunity to move forward and reaffirm their commitment to women, to equal opportunity,” Warfield said.Zucker said that her client’s “courage and willingness to stay the course” was aimed at making a difference for others as well as herself.“As a lawyer, it’s a good day when you get a deserving client a resolution with which they are content,” Zucker said. “It’s a great day when you get a resolution not only for them, but for others.”—Staff writer Samuel Y.

BOSTON—The Harvard men’s hockey team has won only two games in the last three months, but the Crimson continues to have Boston University’s number.Harvard won its first game Monday night since a dramatic overtime win over the Terriers on Jan. 9 by defeating No. 13 BU, 7-4, in the Beanpot consolation game at TD Garden.After falling behind, 2-0, the Crimson scored five of the next six goals in a dominant offensive performance while freshman Peter Traber made 43 saves to earn his first career victory.In its last two wins over the Terriers, Harvard has scored more goals than it did in the nine games in between.“My first comment to [Harvard coach] Teddy Donato is that they should play us all the time,” BU coach Jack Parker said. “They manhandled us.... It was nowhere near the type of effort we need.”
Just over a minute and a half into the second period, BU’s Evan Rodrigues scored a power-play goal to put the Terriers ahead, 3-2.But from there, seniors Luke Greiner and Marshall Everson went on an offensive tear, registering two tallies each during a 20-minute span.Everson scored first, tying things up two minutes after Rodrigues’ goal when he took a behind-the-net pass from rookie Kyle Criscuolo and fired it home from the slot.“We’ve been trying to work the puck down low,” Greiner said. “Tonight we did a good job behind the net and springing some guys in front.”Just a minute later, Greiner snagged a pass from classmate Conor Morrison and beat Maguire to give Harvard a 4-3 lead.At the 16:33 mark of the period, the forward was at it again, this time on the power play. Greiner’s second score of the game, off passes from senior Danny Biega and freshman Brian Hart, put the Crimson up, 5-3.Late in the period, BU’s Alexx Privitera was thrown out of the contest after he kneed senior forward Alex Fallstrom, who remained down for a few moments before slowly getting up.BU was able to kill the ensuing overlapping five-minute power play, but just seconds after it ended, Everson collected a Fallstrom rebound in the slot and fired past Maguire to put Harvard up, 6-3, with 16:47 to go.“Our senior group, I thought, carried the day for us,” Donato said. “It was nice to see them have such a big night.”Cason Hohmann squeezed a rebound past Traber from the left corner of the net with 8:35 remaining to cut the deficit to two, but the rookie was able to withstand heavy pressure and hold the lead the rest of the way. Greiner completed his first career hat trick with an empty-netter with eight seconds to go.

“Sure I’ve heard of the Brattle Theatre!” Steve A. Buschbach ’16 says. “Where is it again?” His response was a typical one. Most Harvard students, it seems, are aware of the Brattle Theatre, having passed it en route to Café Algiers or American Apparel or contemplated taking a date there. But of the nearly dozen students I approached, only one had actually patronized the tiny cinema. Preoccupied with extracurriculars, relationships, and spring classes that are quickly exiting the honeymoon phase, the average Harvard student, it seems, has little time to ponder the state of his neighborhood movie theater. The Brattle is not the only one of its kind. While the number of independent movie theaters in the United States has declined over the years, the Boston area boasts an unusually high concentration of non-chain cinemas. Four such independent cinemas are located within five miles of Cambridge: the Coolidge Corner Theatre, located in Brookline; the Somerville Theatre; the Harvard Film Archive; and, of course, the Brattle. Each of these institutions has a rich and decades-long history, and the success these theaters are enjoying in spite of an onslaught of 21st-century technology suggests that the history behind them will continue to accrue.

 REELS STILL SPINNING It might be expected that the ledgers of local, independent theaters would offer bleak accounts of declining viewership and sinking incomes. But the Cambridge-area independents offer a glorious affront to current trends. Each is comfortably in the black. Ned R. Hinkle has been creative director for the Brattle for twelve years and has been working for the theatre since 1996. His connection to the theater goes back to his high school days, when he was a frequent visitor to the movie house. His account of the Brattle’s financial history since it became a not-for-profit theatre is encouraging. “[The Brattle Film Foundation] took over in March of 2001, then September 11 happened. Corporate money dried up overnight; audiences retreated. But we’ve been able to grow the audience over the years,” he says. “We’ve had three straight years of audience growth.” This is especially impressive given recent patterns for the film industry in general. “While the movies make tons of money, it’s because they keep raising ticket prices. Really, what’s happening is the number of people who go to see movies in movie theaters is declining,” Hinkle says. The Harvard Film Archive has also enjoyed viewership stability. According to Brittany B. Gravely, who studied film at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and has served as publicist for the archive for a little over two years, the archive won’t be in financial trouble anytime soon. “It seems like we have a fairly steady flow of patrons,” she says. “We still have sold-out shows pretty frequently.” The theaters in Harvard Square are not the only ones that have remained solvent over the years. According to employees at both the Coolidge Corner Theatre in Brookline and the Somerville Theatre, audience sizes have remained healthy. “As a whole [viewership] has increased tremendously,” Ian M. Judge, director of operations at the Somerville, says. “We [recently] pushed through to become a first-run movie theatre…. Since then, our attendance has grown.”

Today’s young Americans ages 18 to 29 are more racially diverse than any generation before them, more likely to be unemployed than those older than them, and more politically active than young people of the recent past, according to an ambitious new <a href=""http://www.iopnewsletter.com/news/02052013_NCC_Millennial.pdf"">study co-sponsored by Harvard’s Institute of Politics.At the same time, half of the so-called millennial generation do not vote, and more than 40 percent believe their vote does not matter in a broken Washington.“Millennials are participating in politics—we can see that. But they’re not really participating in governing,” IOP Director C.M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said. “So for us, that’s probably the next step. We’ve learned how to promote political engagement, so how do we promote governmental engagement?”The findings are part of a new index of civic engagement which aims to account for broad educational, economic, and other demographic differences among the country’s 46 million millenials.Among a broad range of findings, the index showed that, though 62.9 percent of young people are employed, 31.2 percent of those people are only working on a part-time basis.
Those with more education are more likely to be civically engaged, though not necessarily more socially cohesive, according to the study.Millennials, who comprised just over 21 percent of the eligible voting population during last November’s election, favored President Barack Obama by more than 20 points—a margin large enough to tip the electoral contest in his favor.“Americans 18 to 29 made a big difference in the 2012 presidential election, but at the same time, only half of them showed up,” said Matthew E. Warshauer ’14, chair emeritus of the IOP’s Public Opinion Project.The unprecedented report is the combined effort of four national research organizations focused on civic participation—the National Conference on Citizenship, Mobilize.org, the Tufts-based Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, and the IOP.“The goal of this report was really to bring together all the knowledge of these different groups to really understand millennial engagement, and, based on that understanding,... use this information to build a stronger civic foundation among Americans 18 to 29,” Warshauer said.The partnership represents a broadening of focus for the IOP, which has traditionally dedicated most of its research efforts to conducting a biannual political <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/11/iop-civic-engagement-voting/"">survey of young voters.The IOP did issue a civic engagement index similar to the new report last spring, but that <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/17/iop-election-survey-obama/"">project was limited to the state of Massachusetts.“We’ve earned a really strong reputation for our understanding of the millennials with the surveys we do every semester, so we really want to be able to go beyond just the survey,” Grayson said.—Staff writer Nicholas P.

In “Paths of Glory,” filmmaker Stanley Kubrick’s 1957 drama of wartime corruption and injustice, an extended tracking shot of runic grace follows Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) along the length of a trench lined with French soldiers. That same shot will one day follow Jack Nicholson’s demented Jack Torrance as he prowls the endless corridors of the Overlook Hotel in “The Shining.” It’s no coincidence that just as the trench will soon be lined with the corpses of Dax’s men, so the Overlook will shortly become Jack’s tomb, enfolding him in its grisly embrace. The glacial, seemingly inevitable progress of the camera, with its lightness and sepulchral calm, is just the kind of filmic memento mori characteristic of Kubrick, the man who knew everything about movies and precious little about human beings.“Paths of Glory” and “The Shining” are perhaps Kubrick’s two most redeemable films in that they are inflected with real emotion. That is not to deny their creator’s genius, but only to suggest that his grandest works, in their fiercely ambitious attempts to confront and understand the universe, lack the human grounding that might have made them cherished as well as revered. The Museum of Fine Arts is showing a Kubrick retrospective throughout February in its excellent Remis Auditorium, and it’s the perfect reminder that while hugely important, Kubrick’s immaculate chilliness—sustained by that particular genius which only lapsed into parody on his execrable late films, “Full Metal Jacket” and “Eyes Wide Shut”—probably has no place in modern cinema.The finest moments in Kubrick’s filmography are usually ones where some passion or pathos breaks through the ice. Douglas’s embittered decency carries “Paths of Glory” to the point where it becomes a cathartic tour de force—the final scene says more about war than anything else in American cinema. Nicholson anchors “The Shining” within the realms of mundanity wherein it becomes far more frightening and intense. “Dr. Strangelove” has Peter Sellers’s improvisatory, comedic talent. The best bits in “2001: A Space Odyssey” are the ones featuring HAL 9000, the self-conscious robot, who displays far more humanity than the virtually anonymous astronauts destroying him.At their worst, though, Kubrick’s practices and idiosyncrasies seem less like inspiration and more like damaging eccentricity. His insistence on shooting in England renders farcical the several haggard palm trees in “Full Metal Jacket,” especially when compared to other contemporaneous Vietnam films like “Apocalypse Now,” “Platoon,” and “The Deer Hunter,” which were on shot on location. The location is also problematic in “Lolita,” supposedly an American road movie, which looks nothing of the sort. Some of Kubrick’s films carry an annoying air of didacticism as well—“A Clockwork Orange” may not actually say anything particularly insightful about violence, but it certainly thinks it does.Watching the films again in a cinema, it’s clear that for all their scope and skill and the many thousands of plaudits they continue to receive, nobody makes movies like this anymore, for very good reason. Cinema is as much about empathy as it is about spectacle, art as much about people as it is about ideas. Kubrick is a reminder that sometimes a filmmaker can be almost too talented, too born for greatness. Watch “Paths of Glory” again, not merely his best but also one of the very best, and recall that when he made it in 1957 he was still just Stanley, still just a man, not the great and godlike Kubrick whose films would one day be shown in the halls of fine art museums like plastic, monolithic monuments to the dead. What an achievement! What a necropolis!

Speaking at a recruiting event for the Harvard Management Company on Monday, HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said she recently has been “more conscious about trying to recruit” Harvard students to work for the Company, which oversees the University’s investments.“What I would like to do is entice some of you into working [for the HMC],” Mendillo told a crowd of about 40 students, including members of finance-related student organizations and supporters of the movement for socially responsible investment at Harvard.In 2009, the HMC—which manages the University’s $30.7 billion endowment—began hiring summer interns from Harvard. Currently, 19 of the company’s employees are Harvard graduates.According to Mendillo, the endowment represents an increasingly large percentage of the University’s operating budget, partially due to decreasing tuition revenue. In this environment, HMC’s portfolio has succeeded in part because of its diversity.“We probably have the most international, the most global, portfolio of any endowment,” she said.
After her presentation, Mendillo fielded questions about financial management and responsible investment.In response to a question about the potential conflict between Harvard’s mission and investment strategy, Mendillo told students that any investment that is not supportive of Harvard’s mission “does not belong in the portfolio.”In the same vein, one attendee asked about her view on the creation of the social choice fund, which the University <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">announced in December.“It’s a challenging area,” Mendillo said. “Not everybody sees social choice and socially responsible investment in the same way.”She added that the the new social choice fund will be “very small” and will not necessarily be able to take advantage of the investment strategies applied for Harvard’s larger funds.Following the talk, Parker G. Clemans ’16, who is in the Veritas Financial Group and the Harvard Financial Analysts Club, said he is “definitely going to consider” recruiting for HMC in the future.Students who did not come to the event for recruiting purposes still said they found the event educational.Casper R. ter Kuile, a Havard Kennedy School student and a member of Responsible Investment at HKS, said that he was “really encouraged” to hear Mendillo’s take on aligning Harvard’s philosophy with its investments.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.

Playing the Terriers may have just been what Harvard needed. Last week, Northeastern defeated No. 13 BU (13-12-1, 10-7-1 Hockey East) in the Beanpot for the first time in 25 years.  Consequently, the Terriers ended up facing off against Harvard in just its fourth consolation game in the last 30 years. Coming into Monday’s contest, the Crimson had only won one game in its last 16–the sole victory coming against BU on Jan. 9, where they came back from two 3-goal deficits to win, 6-5, in overtime.
 The Harvard men’s hockey team (6-15-2, 3-12-1 ECAC) again found itself down on separate occasions, trailing 2-0 in the first period and 3-2 in the second. But in a season characterized by  a number of lows, the Crimson was able to fight back as it did over a month ago against the same Terrier squad.  Harvard scored three goals in the second and two more in the third, capped off by senior Luke Greiner’s first career hat trick, to defeat BU, 7-4, to clinch third place for the 16th time in Beanpot history.SENIOR RESILIENCEThis was a night for the seniors, with six of the seven Crimson goals coming off the sticks of these Beanpot veterans. “I was happy that our senior group carried the day for us today and it was nice to see them have such a big night,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.

Harvard affiliates shared their experiences with discrimination and lack of workplace diversity during a discussion at the Office of Career Services on Monday. Guest speakers—a mixture of Harvard alumni and Harvard-affiliated professionals—provided advice and strategies for identifying and handling issues on the job at the event, entitled “Navigating a Less Diverse Workplace.”One female speaker of mixed minority descent said that new clients often assume her inferiority to male colleagues.Another speaker, the only Latino member of an investment bank summer associate program, said he felt he had to work harder than the average employee to establish himself as a valuable contributor.During audience introductions, a senior voiced her concern over past interviews in which she had been probed about identifying as a gay woman and the implications it posed for her career and family plans.The discussion touched on identifying and responding to subtle instances of workplace discrimination in which individuals are unsure whether they are being discriminated against. Two categories of discrimination were highlighted: barriers to entry and hindrances to success within an organization. The speakers urged students to be assertive and aware that stereotypes can be changed.
“We’ve had students who go into our recruiting [program] and everyone who interviews them is a white male, or has very different political beliefs,” said Robin E. Mount, director of career, research and international opportunities at OCS. How do you approach this situation? How do you decide that this is a place that is welcoming for you?”Speakers emphasized the importance of screening potential employers to find a workplace environment that excites them while also looking good on paper.Event attendee Denise Acosta ’15 said she learned much from the discussion.“[This is] not something you get in the classroom—you learn it by meeting people, talking to people, hearing their stories. Coming from a Mexican-American background, sometimes it’s really comforting to see people like you who have made it,” said Acosta. “Just realizing discrimination exists and having strategies to work around it makes all the difference.”—Staff writer Anneli L.

                        The Rainbow Sign
                    
</h2>
In an earlier <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/10/israel-palestine-statehood/"">op-ed, I wrote that peace is about overcoming history. And that is true. But overcoming history does not mean forgetting or ignoring it. Truth must precede reconciliation.  This is a column dedicated to finding creative solutions to the conflict in the Middle East, exploring a variety of narratives. The Midrash says that one can pursue peace between others after he practices peace in his own life. So before I preach to Israelis and Palestinians, I must make my own peace.At the beginning of last year, I penned an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/11/harvard-orthodox-jews/"">op-ed called “The Hillel Problem.” The piece lambasted Orthodox Jews and their religious practices. Additionally, it derided the Reform movement for its nascent embrace of tradition. For days on end, it was the most read article on The Crimson’s website, the object of pillory and plaudits.A few months later, I regret ever having published it. Looking back, I made facile assumptions about different streams of Judaism, conflating Reform with Conservative and Modern Orthodox with ultra-Orthodox. Depicting the Orthodox as a monolithic group, I proceeded to make grave charges against them, both explicit and implicit. I caricatured them as undemocratic, insular, medieval, threatening, and disloyal. When it comes to some ultra-Orthodox factions, these criticisms clearly hold. However, the application of these descriptions to the whole Orthodox community was fatuous, journalistically shoddy, and intellectually lazy. It also bore the mark of bigotry. It was wrong. I apologize.As I spent time at Hillel last semester, I realized that I had grossly mischaracterized the place. Hillel is not Borough Park on Mount Auburn Street. The only three-piece suits there are ones spun from whole cloth. Sideburns there are the product of an outmoded fashion sense, not a fanatic religious devotion. The members of Hillel’s Modern Orthodox minyan do not want to oppress women or impose their beliefs upon a civil state. Just like me, they seek to steer the ship of faith safely through today’s dangerous waters. Fixated on the shoals of modernity, they advocate a more careful, more conservative course.I question that approach, and I still find certain aspects of Modern Orthodoxy to be objectionable. Men and women are separated at synagogue. Female rabbis are not allowed. Perhaps too much Hebrew is incorporated into the prayer service. Negative attitudes about same-sex relations prevail among religious authorities. These are fundamental disagreements. Since “The Hillel Problem” was published, I have had conversations about these issues with members of the Modern Orthodox community at Harvard. The people to whom I have spoken think deeply about these matters. They are by no means hardened zealots; their love of debate is as legion as any Jew’s.  I am not sure whether our differences can be resolved, or whether they should be. But I do know this: Dialogue is more constructive than diatribe.
I think more critically about what I write and examine closely the language in which I couch my arguments. I am weary of snap judgments. Sometimes, I even pull columns back for further editing and research, as I did this week with an article about the Progressive Jewish Alliance’s Open Hillel campaign. When it comes to Israel vs. Palestine, I know where I stand: I am a liberal Zionist. But “The Rainbow Sign” will not be “The Hillel Problem.” It will engage with opposing points of view instead of straw men. I will talk to everyone, not just those with whom I agree. That’s the sort of journalism that Crimson readers deserve, the sort this subject demands. I expect to bring you nothing less.Shalom.Daniel J.

Waking up for that difficult Monday class after a long weekend, students feel the failures of Harvard University Dining Services more than ever. If they make it to Annenberg for hot breakfast, students might find that the Hawaiian pizza from the other day has been made over (with an egg on top) as “Breakfast Hawaiian Pizza.” At lunch, it would be understandable if they bypassed the overwhelmingly beige and carb-heavy chicken fingers and fries and instead went to make a sandwich. With luck, there might be mustard available. Students looking for dinner after 7:30 p.m., though, should look elsewhere. And anyone entertaining a hope for food that has not already been served multiple times this semester should go to a restaurant.These criticisms are not new. HUDS is capable of turning out top-notch food, as they do at the harvest dinner in the fall, formal dinners, and events like the upcoming Brazilian Brunch, but they are incapable of producing high-quality food consistently. In order to overcome these deficiencies and improve the student dining experience, Harvard should shutter HUDS and outsource dining operations to an experienced contractor.The importance of food quality for students transcends mere nutrition. Dining is a key component of student life. The 2009 <a href=""http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic654957.files/Report%20on%20Harvard%20House%20Renewal.pdf"">Report on Harvard House Renewal concluded that “dining halls are critical to House life” and contained vague recommendations to explore the return of hot breakfast and increased access to after-hours dining options. The USA Today education blog has also noted a speculative <a href=""http://www.usatodayeducate.com/staging/index.php/campuslife/does-quality-of-college-food-affect-student-happiness"">link between student happiness and perceived food quality. Schools that rank more highly on Newsweek’s food rankings also tend to appear higher on the student happiness rankings.In fairness to HUDS, Harvard food is a far cry from revolting. The spring 2012 dining satisfaction <a href=""http://harvarddining.blogspot.com/2012/05/residential-dining-spring-2012.html"">survey revealed overall satisfaction with residential dining was 3.87 out of 5, and College Prowler surveys of current students <a href=""http://collegeprowler.com/harvard-university/campus-dining/"">awarded Harvard campus dining an “A.” Moreover, the meal experience can improve once students begin eating in their Houses instead of Annenberg.HUDS also has to contend with challenges that other schools do not. The tradition of Harvard Houses requires that HUDS operate twelve dining halls plus Annenberg and Dudley House. Across the river, Boston University Dining operates <a href=""http://www.bu.edu/dining/where-to-eat/residence-dining/"">three residential dining halls for an undergraduate population that is 2.5 times larger than Harvard’s. Funneling students to a few large dining halls helps reduce overhead costs so more money can be spent on actual food preparation, but that is simply not an option given Harvard traditions.
Yet the fact remains that Harvard dining should be better. There should be hot breakfast, late night dining options beyond the hit-or-miss brain break fare, and more choice in general. The menu should be varied enough that items rarely appear more than once in a season.Other schools have managed to meet those challenges by outsourcing to third-party contractors. At Washington University in St. Louis, Wheaton College, and St. Olaf College, dining is provided by Bon Appétit, a dining management company that focuses on sustainability. Princeton Review <a href=""http://www.princetonreview.com/schoollist.aspx?type=r&amp;id=683"">ranked those three schools in the top 20 for campus food. Other schools use <a href=""http://www.flik-usa.com/"">Flik or <a href=""http://www.chartwellshighereducation.com/"">Chartwells. (All three of these companies are <a href=""http://compass-usa.com/Pages/Education.aspx"">owned by the Compass Group.) They also have options for <a href=""http://diningservices.wustl.edu/menuslocationshours/Pages/BearsDen.aspx"">late-night dining and even serve hot breakfast.These schools have managed to serve better food while keeping costs low. Board at Harvard is <a href=""http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/financial_aid/cost.html"">$5,264 this year, compared to <a href=""http://diningservices.wustl.edu/mealplans/Pages/default.aspx"">$5,318 for the top-of-the-line meal plan at Washington University. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which uses Bon Appétit, the most expensive plan is <a href=""http://dining.mit.edu/meal-plans/options"">$4,635.The dining issue is not an intractable problem. Yale Dining, which is an in-house operation like HUDS, manages <a href=""http://www.yale.edu/dining/locations/dininghalls.html"">as many dining halls as Harvard, but their top meal plan costs <a href=""http://www.yale.edu/dining/options/mealplan.html"">$5,992 per year. Harvard can either choose to make its students spend more money, on par with Yale and use the additional to improve food service, or even better, it can look to schools that have chosen to outsource their food service.The greatest barrier to outsourcing would be concerns over losing control of staffing and management choices, but Harvard could carefully negotiate its contract to avoid the kinds of pitfalls that Yale <a href=""http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxxi/2001.02.23/opinion/p12aramark.html"">experienced when their dining halls were managed by Aramark. The contract could include incentives for increasing satisfaction with dining to prevent the kind of cost-cutting measures that seem to decrease the quality of food that HUDS serves now. Harvard might also run into opposition from dining hall staff, but Harvard could negotiate re-hiring for all or most of them by the new contractor. The staff is not the source of the poor food quality, after all.More broadly, Harvard has fallen behind other schools in the facilities it offers. In a race to attract students, many universities have <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/business/colleges-debt-falls-on-students-after-construction-binges.html?pagewanted=all"">spent money on amenities. Harvard has never needed to improve its food or renovate its housing to attract students, but that does not mean it should abandon student quality of life. At a time when some question the wisdom of attending college, when students can simply watch lectures on a computer screen, the value proposition of a school like Harvard is the outstanding student experience. Harvard should not forget that.Chris B. Farley ’16 is a Crimson editorial writer in Grays Hall.

Speaking to an audience in Sanders Theatre that included University President Drew G. Faust, a panel of professors from Harvard and the University of Michigan on Monday night urged both citizens and businesses to make environmental activism their top priority.During the event, panelists stressed the importance of building a consensus that motivates individuals and corporations to act, rather than just passively voicing concern about climate change.According to panelist and Harvard government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere, polls show that most Americans say they are concerned about climate change, but are reluctant to do anything about it once costs are mentioned.“People are of two minds about global warming,” he said.By way of a solution, Ansolabehere suggested that the climate change discussion be framed in the context of deeply personal local issues, rather than as an abstract concept. Panelist and Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92 said that environmental activist movements need to create a sense of both urgency and hope in order to get people to act.
He cited other social campaigns, like the Civil Rights Movement, that worked at “changing people and how they thought.”University of Michigan professor Andrew J. Hoffman argued that today’s public must fundmantally shift its attitude regarding environmentalism, just as the 19th century public shifted its views on slavery during the abolitionist movement.Harvard Business School professor Rebecca M. Henderson stressed the importance of getting businesses involved as well as individuals. She said that some firms are following investment guidelines that take sustainability into account while preserving returns. She added that universities would be wise to “ally” themselves with this type of investment.At the end of the panel, Faust stepped out of her seat and onto the stage. She wrapped up the event by saying that activism necessitates “mobilizing universities” in order to “support the best of human life.”Audience members said that they generally appreciated the panelists’ discussion of environmental activism outside of a scientific framework.“I think it was really interesting to see Harvard faculty involved in different areas we wouldn’t normally associate with the issue,” said Alli J. Welton ’15, who is a board member of Divest Harvard, Harvard’s chapter of environmental activism group Students for a Just and Stable Future. “In terms of really making a difference, we need the political scientists to be talking about it.”

Harvard Divinity School professors reacted with surprise—and, in some cases, comprehension—to Pope Benedict XVI’s historic announcement Monday that he will resign as head of the Roman Catholic Church at the end of this month.In an announcement delivered in Latin to a crowd of cardinals, the 85-year-old German pontiff said that he no longer has the strength to carry on in his position. He will officially step down on Feb. 28, ending an eight-year papacy that was often rife with controversy.For many, including Divinity School professor Kevin J. Madigan, the news came as a shock.“I do not think anyone saw this coming, including bishops and archbishops around the world,” Madigan wrote in an email.Yet other faculty members were less surprised. Divinity School professor Francis S. Fiorenza, who is a former student of the pope, said that his old teacher had “dropped hints” of an impending resignation in previous public statements.
“In several interviews, he said if he felt he was too frail or too sick to do the job that he would resign... So for him to retire at 85 makes perfect sense,” Fiorenza said.Divinity School professor Francis X. Clooney wrote in an email that, although Benedict’s decision to step down seems shocking and novel, the act of resignation was “not in itself very significant.”“There was/is no rule that a pope has to serve for life. Benedict is a sober and sensible man; we all live longer these days, and he seems to have recognized his mortality, and the limits of his strength,” Clooney said.Though Benedict is the first pope to have stepped down in almost 600 years, many—including Benedict’s late predecessor Pope John Paul II—have faced deteriorating conditions in their final years. Madigan speculated that this history may have influenced Benedict’s decision.“I am sure that, having witnessed John Paul II’s slow physical and mental decline, even as he continued to hold the office of pope, he did not wish to decline in the same way, publicly and while holding the highest office in the church,” Madigan wrote.Professors also said that Benedict’s resignation inevitably raises questions about the path of succession.While Fiorenza voiced doubt that an American will fill the position, saying he believes that the next pope will be someone who has had extensive Vatican experience in the last few years, Clooney suggested that the transition could prompt renewal.“It is always notable when there is the prospect of a new pope coming into office, since this makes possible new ideas and change in the Church,” Clooney wrote.Clooney added that he expects that the swiftly approaching selection process, which slated to be complete before Easter Sunday on March 31, will leave the Vatican in flux.“That the election of a new pope will happen on relatively short notice, without much preparation, creates an uncertain situation, possibly a dramatic one,” Clooney said.—Staff writer Zohra D.

With its main character considering the endlessness of death, “the realm of wonder and disillusion so sad,” only two pages in, it is immediately clear that Jamaica Kincaid’s latest novel has taken on a promisingly profound set of themes.  Yet for all its sprinkled insights on destiny and the passage of time, “See Now Then” is a case where the sum of the parts performs better than the whole. Kincaid proves able to characterize subtly if unevenly, to make brilliant observations, and to limit her focus to a comparatively small group of recurring leitmotifs. But despite Kincaid’s technical fluidity, the book’s delivery is marred by a miscalculation on Kincaid’s part that casting time as the focal character could eliminate the need for more relatable human ones; ultimately, her attempts to bolster her characters—inserting mythology, gifting them with elevated description—fail as she is unable to control her own superseding, temporal creation.The ironically named Mr. and Mrs. Sweet, with their son Heracles and their daughter Persephone, have lived undistinguished and unhappy in a rural Vermont house once inhabited by Shirley Jackson—famous for her horror stories that take place in the innocent American suburbs. Mr. Sweet, a white man and sometime aspiring classical musician, has long hated his Caribbean-immigrant wife and desired to kill her, as well as their son, in various gruesome ways: strangling, beheading, blowing their brains out. His charges against her are small in themselves—failing to appreciate his values, laughing too much, giving birth to his children, being uneducated—but over the years have accreted as innocently and irreversibly as a deposit of snow. A kind of Earth-mother Everywoman, Mrs. Sweet struggles in her unappreciated role as a housewife and eases the pain by writing in a journal.In keeping with Kincaid’s plan to make time “the main character,” as stated in an interview with The New York Times, the novel begins with Mrs. Sweet looking out the window at the rushing waters of a river, reliving old memories of “then” in the moment of “now.” In the end, Mr. Sweet decides to devastate his oblivious wife by more conventional divorce, and Mrs. Sweet is flooded by an internal river of loss, echoing the famous Pythagoras passage in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses”: “Right now will be replaced by another right now: and right now is all there is and all there is over and over again.” Mrs. Sweet’s thought that “my lips that are the shape of chaos before the tyranny of order is imposed on them is where I find myself” suggests Ovid’s cosmogony, where all being is generated from Chaos.Kincaid has been successful, too successful, in achieving what she wanted with this book: to stylistically subordinate all human identities to the greater presence of time. Kincaid’s style embeds common images from contemporary life (McDonald’s happy meals, Verizon phone bills, Ninja Turtles) in the patterns of ancient history; however,  a third-person narrative voice shifts among the Sweets’ pop-culture-ridden internal monologues with a medieval tone affected through phrases like “benighted” or “in the thrall of.” Enfolded in this bizarre multi-temporal voice,  her characters’ internal monologues become muffled and indistinguishable.  The Sweet family members are too Everywoman-Everyman to be believable as individuals as well, and instead of driving a plot, they passively let the story happen to them. The running gags about Heracles’ Twelve Labors, Persephone’s beauteous beauty, and so on are explicitly and cheesily mythical, and such a mash of past-present is not always effective enough to justify calling it more than cute. Kincaid describes the birth of Persephone:<span style=""white-space: pre;""> “Of course, the beautiful Persephone had opened her lungs by crying upon<span style=""white-space: pre;""> emerging entirely from Mrs. Sweet’s body (she had been living parasitically<span style=""white-space: pre;""> off Mrs. Sweet as she lay growing contentedly in that dear woman’s womb)<span style=""white-space: pre;""> and then she fell deeply asleep and in that sleep she became the<span style=""white-space: pre;""> beautiful Persephone, again and again and forever.”
The parenthetical aside—comparing the daughter to a parasitic worm—underscores the irony of the parallel between Persephone and her Greek mythological namesake, the daughter of harvest goddess Demeter. But the sharp grossness of the image and the hectic, baby-like, singsong quality of the words “again and again and forever” seem to have been selected mainly for shock value, with the result that the words are distracting and gimmicky. The book’s mythical references are often so crudely ironic that the irony frequently dampens, rather than drawing out, the power of their suggested parallels to classical epic personalities. Overall these moments have an irritating smart and fast feel; Kincaid’s run-on sentences, reflecting the book’s central image of a river, rush at us and flow confusedly away without leaving a lasting impression.The book’s good moments are always scenes peeking into the mundane, devoid of these tacky modern-myth ironies.  The ending passages are notably powerful, with Mrs. Sweet dissolving into despair: “And now Mrs. Sweet turned not into stone but a mound of mud, and sorrow became her middle name if she possessed one but she did not then and not now.” However, even the vulnerable Mrs. Sweet, the best candidate for credibility among the characters, never entirely possesses her own voice and so does not seem consistently real enough to be called a tragic figure—a phenomenon helped along by Kincaid’s hurried sentences.Ultimately, Kincaid is at war with her own characters. The characters are losing not only the war against time but also against the whims of their own creator; they can only give in and feel less real. The overly fragmentary nature of the book and flattened characters prevent it from being better than a song or ditty, let alone the symphony it has aspired to be.—Staff writer Victoria Zhuang can be reached at vzhuang@college.harvard.edu.

Boston’s fifth biggest snowstorm on record was mighty enough to temporarily close down state roads, halt Harvard operations, and postpone the freshman formal this past weekend. But it did not deter Falafel Corner employee Ibrahim Souz, who voyaged out into the swirling snow to deliver a take-out meal to a hungry customer on Friday night.Falafel Corner, which served Middle Eastern cuisine until 3 a.m. Saturday morning, was among several businesses in Harvard Square that decided to brave the weekend’s blizzard­. Despite warnings from local and state authorities, some stores ran operations into the wee hours of Saturday morning. More chose to re-open on Saturday morning or afternoon.For the eateries that stayed open, business as usual in a mostly shuttered Harvard Square meant big crowds and unusual challenges.“We were crazy busy because no one else was open,” said Falafel Corner owner Ahmed Naguib. “We really sacrificed a lot to be here and especially do deliveries.”Felipe’s Taqueria, a Mexican restaurant in The Garage, stayed open until 9:30 p.m. on Friday and resumed regular business hours at 11 a.m. on Saturday, sacrificing only five hours of its regular operations schedule to the blizzard.
“Felipe’s has been open for nine years now, and we have never closed early or opened up late,” said Thomas J. Brush, the restaurant’s co-owner. “We knew about [the blizzard] ahead of time, so we didn’t run out of ingredients or have any problems.”Biswa Tiwari, a shopkeeper at Tommy’s Value, slept in the convenience store’s basement on Friday night to make sure that the store could keep its regular hours of 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. Tiwari, like others who stayed open, said that his decision to continue operations during the blizzard was good for sales.“I won’t give exact numbers, but we had a more than 50 percent increase in business,” Tiwari said.Business was so good that other shops, such as convenience store CVS, were depleted of items by early Friday evening.“It was a hundred times worse than Hurricane Sandy,” CVS store manager Bill Mahoney said. “Our shelves were wiped out. There was no milk, no bread, no chips, no anything.”Despite high profits, several stores that chose to stay open were understaffed due to the traffic ban placed on the Commonwealth by Governor Deval L. Patrick ‘78.Many store managers felt compelled to close before the ban went into effect at 4 p.m. on Friday so that workers could get home safely.“We wanted to allow staff to get home safely and decided to play it safe,” said Pinocchio’s Pizza &amp; Subs owner Adam DiCenso, who shuttered his store early on Friday.  “Once the ban was lifted, four of us were able to get the ovens running and get back at it.”Businessowners said that their motivation to stay open—or re-open as early as possible—was ultimately to serve the public.“It’s not all about the money and that,” Brush said. “Everyone was just so appreciative that we were open, and they were thanking us again and again.”—Staff writer Michelle Denise L.

Grammy-winning a cappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock take their name from Psalm 81:16, which reads, “With honey from the rock I would satisfy you.” For over 30 years, the legendary group has been satisfying listeners in its own special way—through soulful, upbeat music with a message of peace. The ensemble visits Harvard this Thursday and Friday for a two-day residency as part of Harvard’s Women’s Choral Festival.The Festival is organized by the Radcliffe Choral Society every four years and features performances by adult, children’s and collegiate choral ensembles. As the headliners of this wide-ranging event, Sweet Honey in the Rock will be leading a master class in Paine Hall on Thursday and performing in Sanders Theatre Friday night alongside members of the Radcliffe Choral Society and the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College.Andrew G. Clark, director of choral activities at Harvard and host of Thursday’s event, says that Sweet Honey in the Rock’s unique sound makes them a clear choice to headline. “Their sound is instantly recognizable…. There’s a woman in the group who has a range lower than many of the male basses in the Harvard Glee Club,” he says. Yet the group is notable for more than just technical ability. “They really use their music-making towards a greater end than mere entertainment,” Clark says. “They have a real message when they sing, whether it’s about issues in the African-American community, issues involving women’s rights... the list goes on and on.”Thursday’s master class, which is free and open to the public, gives lovers of vocal music a rare opportunity to see a legendary group at work in a small-scale setting—and to join in with them as well. “They really do a masterful job of incorporating the audience,” Clark says. “The folks that come will no doubt have a chance to sing along with them…. It’ll be a great chance for [the attendees] to get together and be inspired by these amazing women.” —Staff writer Tree A. Palmedo can be reached at treepalmedo@college.harvard.edu.

Let's face it—the Grammys are as much about the performances as they are about the awards. As such, there are the ""official"" winners, and then there are the real winners—and losers. The Arts blog has highlighted three of each—those whose presence and performance demanded respect, and those who fell flat.<!--more-->WINNER: Justin TimberlakeJT is back. Donning his ""suit and tie shit"" and performing via a sepia telecast (because sepia is the classiest color scheme, of course), the former 'N Sync star crushed two new songs from his <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/series/arts/article/2013/2/11/upcoming-2013-comeback-albums/"">upcoming album and generally exuded massive swag.LOSER: Taylor SwiftThe anti-swag award goes to T Swift, who was shown awkwardly dancing in her seat for what seemed like every single song. Swift took home one Grammy, but got shut out in all the major categories and essentially lip-synced her way through a bizarre Alice in Wonderland-themed performance of ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together."" Ex-boyfriend John Mayer, sitting next to a scantily-clad Katy Perry, probably wasn't too upset over seeing her.
WINNER: Miguel""Miguel, I don't know who the hell you are, but we need to sing together. I mean, good God. That was the sexiest damn thing I've ever seen,"" gushed Kelly Clarkson about the R&amp;B singer's performance. Miguel seemed genuinely pumped to be performing his single ""Adorn,"" which took home Best R&amp;B Song honors.LOSER: Mikky EkkoIf you don't know that name, don't feel bad at all. You'd think that performing with Rihanna would bring out the best in someone, but this singer-songwriter slouched his way through the song ""Stay"" with the manner and dress of a bored ski lodge attendant.WINNER: Mumford and SonsThe folk rockers ripped their way through an unsurprisingly raucous version of ""I Will Wait"" (although the crazy flashing lights seemed over the top for a band that's so consciously acoustic at its core). Later, they got their own tribute performance in the form of The Lumineers' ""Ho Hey,"" and shocked everyone by winning the grand prize of Best Album. Not bad for a band that <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/25/mumford-babel-review/"">this publication has likened to ""the Old Navy version of last fall's best style.""LOSER: Frank OceanIt isn't a stretch to say that Frank Ocean won 2012 in music: His debut album, ""<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/16/frank-ocean-review-channel-orange/"">channel ORANGE,"" was revered by critics and successfully catapulted him into the mainstream. It was shocking, then, to see him fall to fun., Gotye, and Mumford &amp; Sons in the three major categories of Best New Artist, Best Record, and Best Album respectively. Even more disappointing was his plodding, out-of-tune rendition of ""Forrest Gump,"" during which he looked visibly nervous. Even fellow Odd Future member Earl Sweatshirt looked a bit confused after the performance. For all the pre-Grammys hype surrounding Ocean, this was a huge letdown.

Though the roads taken by artists which lead them to produce creative works can be complex and indirect. The story of John A. Wood is particularly unusual. Wood’s  paintings make up the exhibit “Where, When, and Why,” which is on display until February 28th at the Gutman Library at the Graduate School of Education.Wood became a painter after an illustrious career as a scientific researcher, meteoriticist, and planetary scientist. Despite having no formal artistic training as a painter, Wood created 21 works in a realist style over the past 10 years.Wood began his career as a geologist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1958. Before retiring from the SAO in 2004, he was a committee member on several advisory committees to NASA, including the STARDUST Discovery Program mission, the Lunar Sample Review Board, and the Mission Definition Team concerned with planning a comet nucleus sample return. In 1973, he was awarded the NASA medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and in 1991, an asteroid was named in his honor.Today Wood's interests lie not in delving into the mysteries of stardust and distant planet, but in creating works of art that document the everyday reality of places like Harvard, Boston, Cape Cod, New York, Virginia, and France. Wood has transitioned from focusing on a realm known by few to depicting the day-to-day life of the places he has lived, a reality with which countless residents are familiar. These oil paintings illustrate scenes such as city views, a marketplace, and colorful architecture with the realism of a photograph.At a reception on Wednesday for the gallery opening, Woods talked about his creative influences. “I just always enjoyed art when I was a kid. And as I grew up, I had a career as a scientist for most of my life,” Wood said “And I didn’t have very much time to do art, which always made me sad because I thought I had a certain amount of talent.... When I retired, almost ten years ago now, I thought, okay, I’ll quit science entirely and give art a chance for the rest of my life.”Set among Wood’s work upon the walls of the Gutman library, the opening reception drew a small mix of graduate students and older professionals from the Cambridge community. The paintings were spaciously mounted throughout the entire first floor reading area, while the refreshments table and mingling area occupied the middle of the room. In this way, Wood’s painting filled the room and surrounded the observers.When deciding on his subject matter, Wood prioritized subjects that he found personally inspiring, over those with more commercial potential. “The things that inspired me are what you see paintings of,” Wood says. “It would be much more strategic in selling paintings if I painted all the same sorts of things…that becomes your brand. It’s a lot easier for a gallery to sell your paintings...And what I’ve done is paint many different kinds of things because many things interest me.”
 Although planetary science and painting are not inherently similar disciplines, Wood nevertheless sees a connection.  “There is interplay,” he said, “It’s not something that I have tried to make anything of. There are many situations and things in science that are really very lovely.” Woods also pointed out that realistic paintings can also help to advance science. “There are people that make a career out of doing scientific art. If you go the National Academy of Science in Washington [D.C.], they have big images on the wall that are taken from nature through a microscope [and] through telescopes. They’re absolutely lovely. There’s no shortage of beauty in nature,” Woods said.Yet, Woods’ transition from scientist to painter was not completely problem-free.“I think it was naïve of me to think I could simply leave science and become an artist and perform at a professional level and compete with people who have spent their whole lives doing art,” he said. “It would be just as hard for a person that was trained as an artist to just then decide to become a scientist. There are just too many things you wouldn’t know.”  Woods’s paintings will be on display at the Harvard School of Education Gutman Library until February 28.  The exhibition is part of a tradition at the Gutman Library, maintaining a gallery that integrates art, specifically local art, into the Harvard Community. Arts in Education graduate student, curator, and gallery manager Ariana Austin says, “We try to leverage a connection and partnership with local organizations and have this be a gateway for students.” An upcoming show in May at the Education School Gallery entitled “Step into Art” will take kids into museums to create their own art inspired by the works they see there on display. Austin says, “This is the School of Education. We really care about people studying the public education system in this country and around the world. So we want their eyes to be filled with [art]... we make it a priority to do a monthly show and an opening reception for every show, every single month without missing a beat. I think it says a lot about valuing the arts and education.” Wood’s work shows that art can an appreciation for art can  come to people with a non-traditional artistic background at all points in life.—Staff writer Nzuekoh N.

                        K-pop Generation
                    
</h2>
On a sweltering August evening in 2012, a plump, 34-year-old hip-hop artist, father of twins, college dropout, and self-proclaimed “B-list star” dropped his sixth album. Within hours, he became the world’s most sought-after musician. Twelve years into his career, Psy (Park Jae-sang) witnessed his fame skyrocket overnight. A few short months later, the music video for his song “Gangnam Style” hit a record-breaking one billion views, becoming the most watched video in YouTube history. Listeners and audiences on multiple continents danced along to the famous horse-dancing moves as they declared the song the pinnacle of K-pop history.However, despite the catchy tune and addictive dance moves of “Gangnam Style,” the song is in no way K-pop’s first formal greeting to the world. Rather, the highly successful song came at the peak of the “Hallyu” Korean Wave that has been sweeping across East Asia for nearly two decades. In fact, according to some music critics, Hallyu itself is the product of nearly a century’s development of Korean music.Though new fans may be quick to equate K-pop with Psy’s “Oppan Gangnam Style” refrain, Hallyu is a cultural phenomenon encompassing television drama series and movies, pop songs, computer games, animation, and a revival of more traditional Korean art forms. In fact, many track the term “Hallyu” back to 1999, when Chinese journalists noted the rapid influx of Korean television drama series and pop music into mainland China. Perhaps Psy’s recent success is a perfect example of being at the right place at the right time, but it is also impossible to discount Psy’s talent and knack for songwriting, nor the fact that Psy has undoubtedly kicked wide the door that had previously been only nudged open by his predecessors in the world of K-pop: award-winning actors and Korea’s first boy bands, girl groups, and solo artists.Since then, the Korean Wave has spread into multiple venues. In 2002, South Korea made the Top 4 cut of the FIFA World Cup tournament. Women and men alike fawned over professional football player Ahn Jung-Hwan and gathered in the streets of Seoul wearing red shirts emblazoned with the phrase, “Be the Reds.” Soon after, audiences spanning from East Asia to the Asian Pacific Islands were tuning into Korean melodrama series “Autumn in My Heart” and “Winter Sonata,” the latter of which is still responsible for the annual arrival of nearly 100,000 tourists to Nami Island, the site at which “Winter Sonata” was filmed. And most recently, albums by K-pop groups Girls’ Generation and Big Bang have earned coveted positions on the Billboard 200 chart, cementing a foundation for Hallyu in the United States.While K-pop inherently includes Korean lyrics, Korean trends, and, of course, ethnically Korean artists, its recent expansion has global appeal: most artists are now required to gain fluency in Mandarin, English, or Japanese, and often release new versions of their songs or special edition EPs in languages outside of their native tongue. In fact, many popular K-pop groups, such as 2PM of JYP Entertainment or f(x) of SM Entertainment, even contain members who are ethnically Chinese or Thai or have mixed heritage. It seems the K-pop industry has recognized the need for both local and universal appeal—for its artists to serve as proud ambassadors of the Korean culture while delivering lines in perfect, unaccented English. The ability of its artists to collaborate and perform with artists of foreign markets only adds to the continuation of K-pop’s conquest worldwide.
There is a fine line to tread between a connection with the home base and the malleability required to captivate diverse audiences; the K-pop phenomenon is carefully walking across this tightrope as it continues to tap into new fan bases worldwide. In any case, there is no doubt that K-pop’s time is here, and K-pop will only continue to grow as it rides the high tide of consumer-driven waves.—Columnist Soyoung Kim can be reached at soyoungkim@college.harvard.edu

The voices of a crowd of women fell to a hush in the Mount Vernon Ballroom at the Sheraton Commander Hotel as the clock hit 7 p.m. 174 pairs of hands rushed to tear open envelopes containing cards revealing the identity of their new sisters. The women shrieked with excitement as they ran to locate their sororities.At this year’s bid day, sororities at Harvard extended bids, or offers of acceptance, to 174 girls, a modest decrease from the 199 bids offered last year. Each of the three sororities on campus, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma, met the limit of at least 54 new members.Approximately 250 women—about the same as last year—attended the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/5/sorority-recruitment-numbers-constant/"">first recruitment event a little more than a week ago.Many of the approximately 75 women who were not extended bids were not rejected due to lack of space in the chapters but rather chose to drop out of the recruitment process independently.“The majority of them chose to withdraw on their own,” said Taylor A. Compton ’13, president of the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council.
Some of the women who removed themselves from recruitment have their eyes set on joining Alpha Phi, a fourth sorority open to College women. Alpha Phi is currently in the process of establishing a presence ahead of its <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/3/alpha-phi-sororities-social/"">inaugural year on campus.“A lot of girls showed interest in Alpha Phi,” said Natalia Duarte ’14, vice president of recruitment for the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council.Alpha Phi representatives from other colleges around the East Coast were present at the first two rounds of recruitment, but their formal recruitment process will take place later this month, with bid day falling on Feb. 28. Women who accepted bids from one of the other sororities may not continue with Alpha Phi recruitment, but those who did not participate in recruitment at all are still eligible to join Alpha Phi.Members of the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council have worked to inform women about the addition of Alpha Phi to Greek life at Harvard by talking to students and sporting Alpha Phi memorabilia such as water bottles and pins.“We’re all walking around and trying to spread the word on campus,” Duarte said.After the women received the bids from their sororities, each chapter held their own festivities to welcome the new members.This year’s recruitment activities were delayed by blizzard Nemo, which brought two feet of snow to Cambridge this past weekend.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

Institutions of higher education espouse values such as service, integrity, equality, and global responsibility. They are the intellectual and moral leaders of our time. Yet, the ways in which these institutions of higher education, like our own, invest their money is currently irresponsible and unacceptable.When you invest in a company, you own part of that company. And if you own something, you are responsible for it. Yet inconsistencies in the things we say we value and the things we invest in abound. This discrepancy is especially crucial as it applies to institutions of higher learning. It is essential that we recognize this and do something about the fundamental contradiction.Harvard considers itself a leader in campus sustainability, and with good reason. With impressive <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/08/a-green-building-milestone/"">LEED-certified buildings and a significant carbon reduction <a href=""http://www.green.harvard.edu/greenhousegas"">goal, Harvard has worked to <a href=""http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/green-is-the-new-crimson-at-harvard/"">make “Green the new Crimson.” But while its campus may be green, its portfolio is not. By investing its endowment in fossil fuel companies, Harvard sponsors global climate change. You’ll never hear President Faust say: “I support global warming that threatens the future of Harvard students.” If she did, the public would be appalled. But making investments in the fossil fuel industry sends that very message, and such a practice should elicit the same disgust.Consciously sponsoring climate change is only one example of our university’s moral inconsistency. Harvard is a member of the <a href=""http://www.trademark.harvard.edu/licensing_program/"">Fair Labor Association, meaning it only grants use of the Harvard trademark to companies that meet fair labor standards. In this way, Harvard uses its brand to promote justice. Yet, at the same time, Harvard invests in <a href=""http://www.secinfo.com/d14D5a.paWXu.htm"">Vale S.A., a Brazilian mining corporation given the <a href=""http://www.imfmetal.org/index.cfm?c=28683&amp;l=2"">Public Eye Award for most evil company in the world, due in part to its dismal treatment of workers.Harvard’s investment in arms manufacturing offers yet another example of moral incongruity. According to <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/"">research by the Harvard School of Public Health, places with more guns have more homicides. In the aftermath of the recent tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Harvard faculty spoke out about the need for violence prevention efforts. For example, Masters of Adams House, Judith S. “Judy” ’67 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, published an impactful <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1215606?query=featured_home"">piece in the New England Journal of Medicine on the topic.
But while members of the Harvard community use their research and positions of leadership to protect us from guns, Harvard continues to funnel money to arms manufacturers with its endowment. Harvard invests <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1082621/000119312512463279/0001193125-12-463279.txt"">funds with the Vanguard Group, the <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=SWHC+Major+Holders"">largest stockholder in Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corporation, a leading U.S. gun manufacturer. In response to the Sandy Hook tragedy, all Vanguard had to <a href=""http://www.boston.com/business/2012/12/19/gun-firms-facing-growing-backlash/iE92d4wenhjuMmv0DlwudJ/story.html"">say was “We believe that mutual funds are not optimal agents to address social change.’’Investments in the fossil fuel industry, companies guilty of exploiting workers, and gun manufacturers all illustrate the misalignment between the values voiced by Harvard and the ownership it actually assumes through its investments.Harvard is not alone in this practice. Ignorance and irresponsibility are ubiquitous when it comes to investing. Some will call me naïve: That this is just the way our system works. That a diversified portfolio is the key to success. That we can work to better the world in other ways.This may be how our system works, but that doesn’t mean it’s the way it should work. We simply cannot afford to think of investments in a separate vein from morality any longer. We must not abandon the values we know to be true when it comes to making a profit.This time might not be far away. I have so much hope for our generation.Because of a campaign spearheaded by our classmates, beginning at the end of this year, donors will have the option of giving to Harvard’s <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">social choice fund, which will be invested separately from the rest of the endowment in funds that meet specific criteria for social responsibility.At the same time, the fossil fuel divestment movement, perhaps more than anything else, has illuminated our morally unacceptable investment patterns. Now students on over <a href=""http://gofossilfree.org/campaigns/"">250 campuses across the country are telling their administrations loudly and clearly, “If it’s wrong to wreck the planet, it’s wrong to profit off of that wreckage.”How we make our money matters, and it shapes the kind of world in which we, ourselves, our children, and future generations will live. Money talks, and it’s time our institutions of higher education lead the way in using it to say what we mean.Hannah M. Borowsky ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, is an organismic and evolutionary biology concentrator in Leverett House.

Sometimes I feel like writing for the Arts Board is a bit like being a defense attorney. Granted, there are some things on which we all agree (shout out to Kendrick Lamar and Pokemon Blue), but a large part of my artistic taste has to be defended. Not in a man-the-barricades, Battle of the Alamo sort of way, but in a more nuanced, “Inherit the Wind” fashion. My love and appreciation of certain things has to be eloquently proven to be definitively good (or at least not shit) in front of a jury of my peers.As a second semester senior, I am using this column as my closing statement on Crimson Arts. I have chosen to use 600 to 800 words, every other week, to defend the relevancy of a select group of soul B-sides. B-sides have been sold on the reverse side of a vinyl record—the A-side was the big hit you generally wanted to buy when you went to the record store back in the day. None of the songs I chose were actually B-sides, but like the songs thrown on the back side of the single, they have been masked by their more popular or commercial counterparts. Hopefully, this column will help bring some of the songs I love out of the shadows of the hit singles so that they can bask in the light they deserve. None of these particular songs are reviled. In fact, I would say most of them are not particularly well known. But hopefully, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, by the end of this semester and this column, you will be completely and utterly convinced that the music I bring to your attention is still very much relevant.The unifying theme of all of these songs––apart from the fact that I happen to like them––is that they have all been unfairly left out of the canon of soul classics. The fact that Marvin Gaye’s best song fits into this category is totally ridiculous, and the reasoning behind this travesty can only be attributed to Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records.Berry Gordy approached the seven-inch single the way Henry Ford approached the Model T: Berry wanted every release on his label––incidentally one of the first corporations run by an African-American—to be made to a specific musical standard, and he wanted them produced fast. It is amazing how this approach to music provided the soundtrack to the 1960s. Most soul artists that people know—the Diana Rosses and Stevie Wonders of the world, for example––recorded at Motown, often with musical accompaniment provided by the same group of backing musicians. Berry made a lot of money, the stars made quite a bit, and the musicians behind all of the hits made virtually nothing. C’est la vie.This brings us back to Marvin. “This Love Starved Heart of Mine,” by Gaye, might just be the best song ever recorded at Motown, but it wasn’t released until almost 30 years after it was recorded, in 1994. This was just one of those songs that inexplicably fell off of the conveyor belt in Motown’s soul-industrial-complex.
“This Love Starved Heart of Mine” starts like many other Motown standards––with a polished drum line and a bass playing a simple 4/4 beat––but this only lasts for the first three seconds. When Marvin comes in, he changes everything. He unleashes a high-pitched wail, energetic, mournful, and full of promise. Quickly he is joined by a guitar laying down a steady barrage of chords, and this swell grows with the horns and strings. By the time the first chorus comes around, the track has transformed into a runaway train. Gaye, the song’s mad conductor, urges the band on with the sort of screams and yelps that you almost never hear in his early work. But then, after three exhausting verses and choruses, it just stops. There is a shimmering crash in the drums, and it seems like the band has finally run out of steam. But then Marvin gives the song its sexiest yelp, and with a Latin-influenced horn and string run, the band picks right up to speed. “This Love Starved Heart of Mine” is big, brassy, brash, and totally fantastic.In a slightly overwrought post-mortem, Pitchfork Media said that Outkast’s “B.O.B.” managed to prophesize every major trend in popular music in the last decade. In a similarly overblown fashion, I would say that in this three-minute rollercoaster, Marvin Gaye managed to encapsulate everything that makes pop music great. It has the driving 4/4 rhythms that White Stripes used to rock our shit in every one of their songs that is worth listening to. Gaye gives this performance the sort of raw charisma that every contestant on “The Voice” wishes he had. The bass has a relentless energy drawn from its simplicity; every bottom-heavy sort of music, from punk to hip-hop, does precisely the same thing. I could go on and on.Take that, Outkast.—Columnist Noah S. Guiney can be reached at nguiney@college.harvard.edu.

The computer science concentration has nearly doubled in size in the last two years and continues to drive growth in Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, according to new data released by the SEAS Communications Office.Following sophomore concentration declarations last November, there were 215 computer science concentrators at the College, compared to 156 a year ago and 109 the year before. SEAS currently boasts 678 undergraduate concentrators, up 20 percent from last year.According to John G. Morrisett, professor of Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II,” SEAS’ emphasis on solid introductory courses has helped to attract undergraduates.“CS50 and David Malan have just been a great gateway for computer science,” Morrisett said. “Similarly, ES50 and other intro courses have made it easier and more fun for a broader range of students [to explore SEAS].”Morrisett said that in addition to the increased number of SEAS concentrators, there has been extensive growth in the number of students taking SEAS classes.

“My class has maybe 40, 50 concentrators, but then there’s roughly 200 students who aren’t CS concentrators taking the class,” Morrisett said. “The reality is that for almost any field that you’re in now...you’re going to use computation.”The numbers of students concentrating in applied mathematics and biomedical engineering grew in November to 227 and 48, marking increases of 15 percent and 14 percent, respectively.SEAS did see a decline in the number of students pursuing both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in engineering sciences. However, these changes can be at least partly attributed to the influx of students into the new stand-alone <a href=""LINK 1: http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/28/seas-new-concentration/"">electrical and mechanical engineering concentrations. As of Tuesday, 21 students have declared concentrations in electrical engineering and 26 have done so in mechanical engineering.David Campos ’15, who switched to the mechanical engineering concentration this semester, said that he thinks the new programs may foster further growth in SEAS by attracting engineering students.“[The lack of a mechanical engineering concentration] was possibly the biggest thing that was pushing me away from choosing Harvard,” Campos said. “I think the addition of the new concentration is definitely going to open up the eyes of prospective students.”While students and faculty see growth as a positive trend, they also recognize organizational challenges and difficulties in maintaining a close-knit classroom environment.This year, CS51 has had to relocate eight of its 16 sections to classrooms in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences due to a <a href=""LINK 2: http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/seas-moves-allston-square/"">lack of space in SEAS.“This is somewhat problematic because most of the FAS rooms are not equipped with enough outlets [or] white boards to effectively teach CS sections,” assistant head teaching fellow Anna V. Gommerstadt ’13 wrote in an email.Morrisett said that a growing teaching staff is also necessary to accommodate the increased enrollment in computer science classes.“The most important thing [for dealing with growth] is being able to hire TFs,” Morrisett said. “That’s the only way we can expect courses like CS50 and CS51 to manage that growth.”Most computer science classes draw heavily from undergraduates to fill teaching staff positions, Morrisett said. This year, CS51 is led by 16 undergraduate teaching fellows and a head teaching fellow who is a graduate student, according to the course website.“While [growth] may seem from one perspective overwhelming, it also brings in a lot of people who could potentially help out with those classes,” said Kevin M. Schmid ’15, a current CS51 teaching fellow. “With the increased number of concentrators comes an increasing number of possible staff members.”—Staff writer Brian C.

On Tuesday, the University of Texas at Austin announced a roster of nine edX courses to be offered in the 2013-2014 academic year, with topics ranging from globalization and energy to pharmaceutics and music.UTx is University of Texas’s subset of edX, the nonprofit virtual learning initiative launched by Harvard and MIT last May, and is still in its formative stages. After <a href=""LINK 1: http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/16/University-of-Texas-edX/"">announcing its partnership with edX this past October, UTx held a proposal competition for online course topics that received more than 20 submissions from its faculty.The four courses which will be offered this fall are “Ideas of the Twentieth Century” by philosophy professor Daniel Bonevac and photography curator Roy Flukinger, “Introduction to Globalization” with Germanic studies professor John Hoberman, “Bench to Bedside: Introduction to Drug Development and the Commercialization Process” taught by pharmaceutics professors Janet Walkow and Alan Watts and online programs director Donna Kidwell, and “Energy Technology &amp; Policy” with mechanical engineering professor Michael Webber.“The costs [of higher education] have been spiraling so extraordinarily over the past couple decades, and I wanted to be able to do an online course free of profit considerations,” said Bonevac.The university will also offer five new edX courses in spring 2014, including “Jazz Appreciation” with music professor Jeffrey Hellmer, “Foundations of Data Analysis” taught by statistics faculty members Catherine Stacy and Michael Mahometa, “Mathematics and Effective Thinking” from mathematics professor Michael Starbird, “Introduction to Embedded Systems” with electrical engineering professors Jonathan Valvano and Ramesh Yerraballi, and “Linear Algebra: Theory and Computation” taught by computer science professors Robert van de Geijn and Margaret Myers. The range of courses represent edX’s <a href=""LINK 2: http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/19/edx-announces-spring-courses/"">growing focus on both the humanities and the sciences.
“With the prestige of Harvard and MIT being involved in edX, this is being done by people who want to put education first and who want to do it well,” Bonevac said.While some UT professors expressed a preference for working with edX over other platforms such as edX’s for-profit competitor Coursera, others did not strongly favor one model over the other.“The university has signed an agreement with edX, so when we were interested in putting the [globalization] course online, edX would be the company that did it,” said Hoberman, a former Harvard professor.Regardless of which platform universities pursue, Hoberman said that he believed online education was an important next step in the democratization of education.“Online education is going to be huge, in a word,” he said.—Staff writer Amna H.

 Apparently tired of extinction, Fall Out Boy is coming out with a new album, ""Save Rock and Roll,"" and touring in a bid to win back the shattered fragments of the teenage hearts they captured so many years ago.But before Fall Out Boy saves its genre, two emotionally overwrought Arts writers debate which of the band's earlier albums reigns supreme.<!--more-->Sorrel L. NielsenEveryone deserves a second chance. When the pop-punk sensation released its first studio album, ""Take This to Your Grave,"" Fall Out Boy was just an okay band. I'll admit, in middle school I yowled along to ""Chicago Is So Two Years Ago,"" but it didn't alleviate my angst. However, they rose from the ashes of their initial mediocrity and tried again. Thus ""From Under the Cork Tree"" was born—the sugary rollercoaster of teen-digestible wretchedness I'd been waiting for.
The most romantic song opening ever occurs on ""Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year"": ""Take our tears, put them on ice / Cause I swear I'd burn the city down to show you the lights."" These lines capture the magic of second-time-around Fall Out Boy—they've given in to melodrama and embraced their now-trademark blend of sociopath and fictional boyfriend. This godly amalgamation wrenched sobs from all lonely girls. When I listened to ""Grave,"" I kept waiting for the music to relieve my (many) pre-teen feelings. On ""Cork Tree,"" I finally understood. Fall Out Boy—at their best—is meant to make you feel worse. Much worse.On ""Cork Tree,"" they found their niche—clever whining that makes petty complaints sound cool and dangerous. Their true calling is making girls like me think our angst is profound while offering a loud drone of not-terrible guitar chords with which to mask the sound of our sobs from our parents in the next room. And with ""Cork Tree,"" they nailed it.Alexander TangEveryone has a band that shaped their early teens, when they were at their most emotionally vulnerable and impressionable. For everyone who had a soul, that band is Fall Out Boy. While questions of favorites are often subjective, when the subject is Fall Out Boy albums, there is one right answer and four hilariously wrong answers. To state that any Fall Out Boy record other than ""Take This to Your Grave"" is the band's best indicates deep character flaws and a fundamental lack of understanding of music, emotion, and humanity.While later releases from the pop-punk quartet saw more mainstream success and showcased the sort of shimmery pop production that would earn the band many of its fans, none of these albums came close to recreating the magic of ""Take This to Your Grave."" ""Grave"" was beautiful in its straightforward sincerity, with its singularly catchy riffs and aggressively sentimental lyrics. From ""Cork Tree"" on, melodrama and showmanship replaced honest songwriting, and bloated production blunted the clean, classically pop-punk instrumental work.""Take This To Your Grave"" is the soundtrack to your first love, your first dance, your first heartbreak. Every social misstep and sun-soaked memory of adolescence falls into place on the tracklist. But even when isolated from any personal connection, the album stands above the rest in an empirical sense. It is Fall Out Boy at their purest and most poetic, before the lures of complicated soundboards and Timbaland lead them astray. ""Grave"" is the best Fall Out Boy album, and I will take that conviction to my grave.Want to take a side? Want to argue passionately for “Infinity on High”? Let us know in the comments.

The third-ranked Harvard men’s squash team will have to wait another year to try its hand in a regular-season contest against No. 1 Trinity College. The Crimson (14-2, 5-1 Ivy) fell, 5-4, at the Murr Center on Tuesday night to the Bantams (15-0), a squad that until last year held a trail of 252 continuous wins, the longest known streak in collegiate varsity sports.“I think the guys really stepped up tonight and I know that there’s going to be at least a couple that are absolutely gutted because we lost the match, 5-4,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “As a team, as a group of young men and as coaches, we’re pretty happy with where we are. There was a lot of maturity tonight. We needed to make some tactical adjustments and they made them. That’s why they were in the running.”Victory was, however, found on the women’s side, as Harvard (12-1, 6-1 Ivy) simultaneously took down Yale (11-4, 4-3 Ivy). The match was previously scheduled to be played on Sunday afternoon but was rescheduled due to weather.“You beat Yale and everyone’s happy,” Way said. “When it’s Harvard-Yale, it doesn’t matter what sport it is.”HARVARD 7, YALE 2
In the culmination of its Ancient Eight season, the women’s team was able to sweep four of nine matches, 3-0.“It was our last dual match of the season and our last home match,” co-captain Sarah Mumanachit said. “We were really looking forward to it, not just because of Harvard-Yale having a big rivalry but also with women’s squash. Our team in the past couple of years has developed a pretty big rivalry with the [Yale] women’s team. It was definitely a really good feeling beating them today. Everyone was excited.”Mumanachit, who moved a step up the ladder to No. 6, was pushed to five games by her Bulldog opponent, Issey Norman-Ross. The senior fought back in the final set to beat Norman-Ross, 11-4, 11-3, 10-12, 10-12, 11-8.“I was very impressed by Sarah getting the job done in five,” Way said. “She was up and then the other girl came back so that showed a lot of courage there.”Sophomore Amanda Sobhy swept 2011 CSA Individual Champion Millie Tomlinson, 3-0, in 11-3, 11-4, 11-2 straight sets. Tomlinson fell three times in the regular season last year, all at the hands of Sobhy.“Sobhy was just brilliant tonight,” Way said. “She showed her true colors and true strength.”Freshmen Saumya Karki and Isabelle Dowling, along with co-captain Natasha Kingshott, were the other three Crimson players to blank their Yale foes, playing at the No. 4, No. 9 and No. 5 positions, respectively.The Harvard squad will have just a short pause before it travels to New Haven for the CSA Team Championships.“It’s made our jobs a lot easier to have such a great group of girls,” Mumanachit said. “We have a really good team dynamic this season. It’s definitely really sad that today was our last home match and that going into the weekend, it’s our last weekend. Four years goes by so quickly. It’s really amazing.”TRINITY 5, HARVARD 4

Harvard women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone told her players to “play with a chip on their shoulders” after a humbling defeat by No. 2 Boston College in the first round of the 35th Women’s Beanpot on Feb. 5.On Tuesday night at Matthews Arena, after a full week off, the No. 5 Crimson team delivered and served a 3-0 shutout to No. 3 Boston University. The squad had a full week off after snowy weather forced the postponement of games.“We did two things,” Stone said. “When we practiced, we practiced hard. When we rested, we rested. I think we had a great balance of both and so it ended up really shaking out like a typical week for us. We took the days off that we typically would take off. We took Saturday off, we went hard on Sunday and we were light yesterday so our kids had a lot of jump and I think you saw that tonight. We were flying.”Harvard (18-3-2, 14-1-1 ECAC) topped the Terriers (18-4-2, 13-2-1 HE), a squad that has now dropped two consecutive games after a stretch of 12 wins and two ties, by outshooting its opponents 28 shots to 18 through the first two periods. This is the first time in program history that BU has finished fourth in the Beanpot.The Crimson victory came at the hands of three forwards. After 23 scoreless minutes, junior Lyndsey Fry found the back of the Terriers’ net off assists by sophomores Samantha Reber and Sarah Edney. Fry’s quick shot evaded BU goaltender Kerrin Sperry and put up the first tally of the game.
Just 18 seconds leader, Reber followed up with a goal of her own, helped by sophomore forward Hillary Crowe who was waiting at the crease to fire off an assist to her teammate.Reber returned the favor two minutes later. The center sent the puck to Crowe, who drilled it into the net to set Harvard up, 3-0, with 4:02 left in the second stanza. Reber finished the night with three points, tying her career-high for the fourth time.“I feel good about [tying my career-high],” Reber said. “But again, it’s not existent without my teammates. They set me up and make beautiful plays in front of the net that allow us to go on those rushes and get great scoring opportunities. I was the one fortunate enough to be the one with the puck tonight in front of the net.”While the Crimson may have sunk three goals in under three minutes, all was not always so promising for the team. The first frame saw the team fail to convert all four of its power play opportunities and yield a penalty of its own.“I think the first period was a little bit just trying to figure it all out,” Stone said. “We had three different looks at the power play with one unit…then we went with what we call a BU power play. It’s an old men’s hockey BU power play and I think they actually ran the same thing in the third period. It just gave us better looks at the net and was more comfortable with two people at the point.”Co-captain Jillian Dempsey entered the night just goal short of Harvard’s top ten all-time points leaders. While the forward contributed significant game minutes, she skated away from the contest having only made two shots, neither of which were successful.“Jill did a lot of things off the puck tonight that made a big difference,” Stone said. “We had to put her at center in the third period a little bit and she did a great job for us there. She does all the little things. She may not appear on the score sheet but so many kids who make a significant impact often don’t.”Crimson goaltender Emerence Maschmeyer made 32 saves, two short of her career-high which was set during last week’s loss to BC. She was particularly effective in the third period, racking up 14 of her saves during the frame.“The third period is always a key period, especially when we’re up a few goals,” the freshman said. “For me, I have to focus on every shot one shot at a time and our team just had to keep confident throughout the third period.”This was the second game in this year’s Beanpot during which a lower-ranked team has upset its opponent. On Feb. 5, unranked Northeastern downed the Terriers, 4-1.“You can see where the ECAC hockey teams are coming up really strong this year,” Reber said. “It makes for a great tournament and it makes for great games all around, no matter what place you’re playing for.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

“Here at Harvard I have had no experience offline dating,” says Linda Trujano ’15. Despite the wind and chill of a brutal winter day, Trujano radiates an easygoing warmth, with her wavy, highlighted hair perfectly coiffed, cheeks bright pink from the cold. “Harvard’s dating scene is almost nonexistent, so I was sad about it and that’s why I decided to join [DateMySchool],” she explains. Since joining the online dating site, Trujano has gone on multiple dates with students from MIT and Harvard’s graduate schools, much to the envy of her friends and, it would appear, Harvard at large.Trujano is one of an increasing number of college students who use online dating tools to enhance their sexual and romantic relationships. From 1999 to 2009, the percentage of couples who met online surged from 10.9 percent to 23.2 percent nationally, according to a study from the University of Rochester. And the phenomenon is no longer limited to older adults: Over the past few years, websites such as DateMySchool and IvyDate emerged as online dating sites specifically for college students.“DateMySchool is responsible for over 50 percent of the dates that happen at Columbia and NYU. We get success stories every single day,” says DateMySchool public relations director Melanie J. Wallner, who has surveyed hundreds of students from both universities. Although the students who participate in online dating on campus maintain a low profile, according to Wallner, one in five students across Harvard University uses DateMySchool.The rise of college-oriented online dating sites, some students say, is symptomatic of a student population that is frustrated with the social options on campus. Currently, many Harvard students are disappointed with the existing dating scene on campus, which they often categorize as a polarized landscape of committed relationships and casual one-night hookups. “It seems to me that you either have two extremes,” says Jacob D. Roberts ’13-’14, an inactive Crimson News editor and former OkCupid user. “People are in long-term relationships or people hook up a few times and then it’s over, and there’s really no in-between.”Whether in response to a limited dating scene or simply as a means of meeting people outside the Harvard bubble, Harvard students are increasingly turning to online dating as an alternative—a way to supplement their sexual and romantic lives. Online dating provides students with the opportunity to look beyond the physical Harvard campus for everything from a one-night stand to a long, dreamy courtship. Whether dating across campuses or meeting young professionals, students find that these tools have proved invaluable in enlarging their social networks. Love online is still far from perfect, but there seems to be a trend towards a social lifestyle that involves both online and offline dating.
A Stigmatized PracticeAlthough the use of online dating tools is on the rise, there is still a significant social stigma attached to its use that prevents a meaningful dialogue on campus. The stereotype of online daters as social recluses eating fast food as they hunch over a computer monitor and talk to strangers thousands of miles away still lingers in the public eye.The history of online dating plays a large role in the development of this negative perception of the practice. “Online dating was basically dominated by geeks,” says Sam A. Yagan ’99, recalling its early days.Yagan, founder and CEO of OkCupid, and now the CEO of Match.com, was an applied math concentrator at Harvard. He continues, “Think about it: The only people on the Internet in 1993 were geeks....If you were single in the 90s, you were cool, and you probably didn’t use the Internet or online date.”Additionally, there exists an expectation that finding a significant other should be relatively easy in a college environment, where one is constantly surrounded by one’s peers. “Online dating here has become a sign of desperation. You’re still young, you’re still in college,” says Michael Hughes ’15, who is in a long-term relationship with a student he did not meet online.And yet, meeting new people can often become more difficult as one progresses through college.“People usually forget that once you’ve joined various clubs and activities, there’s going to be a bit of stasis in your lives,” says Paul W. Eastwick, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the psychology of romantic relationships and online dating.On Campus: Dating, Hook-Ups, and FrustrationsIn addition to this stasis that Eastwick mentions, some posit that Harvard students especially tend not to prioritize dating. “It’s hard to actually meet people, especially in a community like Harvard, where everyone is so busy and no one stops to get to know each other,” says Jake, a gay freshman from California who has used OkCupid. Jake was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he wanted to keep his sexual orientation private.“We just seem to not have time to go out to the North End, or go to a nice restaurant, or take a walk through the park,” says Hughes, echoing Jake’s sentiment. According to The Crimson’s senior survey of the Class of 2012, 48.6 percent of women and 49.4 percent of men reported having dated zero to one person at Harvard.

I would like to be unbiased, open to new ideas, accepting of arguments that contradict my own beliefs. I am willing to put a good deal of effort into achieving these traits, because they seem unequivocally good, the hallmarks of a reasonable person. However, when I pick up a newspaper and begin reading an op-ed that I disagree with, I instinctively want to put down the paper and stop reading.It should not be hard to read opinions that are out of line with my own—I am not so naïve as to think that my opinions represent a universal consensus—but I experience an almost visceral, negative reaction to strongly-worded arguments for beliefs that run counter to mine. This reaction is ingrained in human psychology, and helps explain why it is so difficult to truly open one’s mind and take a non-partisan approach to political issues. Confidence, on the whole, feels good. When we are confident in our opinions, we feel better about our choices, our abilities, and ourselves. Unfortunately, the human sense of confidence is derived in such a way that dissenting opinions tend to damage it, making those opinions unpleasant.Confidence in our beliefs is based mainly on the coherence of the evidence for them, rather than the magnitude of the evidence. If I have ten pieces of evidence in favor of a belief, I will not be much more confident in that belief than if I had five. If, however, I have one piece of evidence in favor of one belief, and for another belief I have two pieces of evidence in favor, but one piece of evidence against, I will be probably more confident in the first belief. This is because all of the evidence for the first belief is coherent, whereas, even though the number of pieces of evidence in favor of the second belief is greater, the coherence of the evidence is not as great—some of the evidence is contradictory.Naturally, the more evidence one uncovers about a given topic, the more likely one is to come across contradictory arguments. As a consequence, the less informed we are about a topic, the more likely we are to feel irrationally confident about a strongly partisan opinion. Essentially, we are rewarded for ignorance with the pleasant feeling of confidence. Technology, often a powerful force for greater dissemination of knowledge, may actually decrease the chances of overcoming our blinders of ignorance on controversial topics.The internet has given us greater access to a wide variety of opinions on a nearly infinite list of subjects, and it is easy to assume that this should help combat close-mindedness. However, an abundance of un-vetted blog posts with no pretension to nonpartisanship has also made it much easier to find opinions that merely corroborate our own preconceptions. In an online landscape with political commentary to cater to any taste, there is no longer any need to encounter the unpleasantness of opposing arguments.
The revolution in personal data analytics further exacerbates this problem by intentionally guiding us towards opinions that reinforce rather than challenge our biases. Google’s search engine delivers individualized search results based on what you have clicked in the past. The New York Times website automatically generates a list of articles that are “recommended for you” based on those you have previously viewed. Youtube, unsurprisingly, puts personal recommendations on the homepage of its site.To be sure, there is no harm in a computer algorithm that automatically creates a list of the cat videos and “Call Me Maybe” parodies most likely to make you laugh, but the march towards a personalized Internet is already making the digital realm less like a virtual public library and more like a private book collection, pre-populated with your favorite authors.There are important benefits to actively seeking out opinions from the other side—one’s own argument will undoubtedly be improved by an understanding of the counter-arguments, but, perversely, one’s confidence in their own position may be shaken.Rather than passively perusing the internet, allowing ourselves to be unconsciously guided towards articles, blogs, and videos that affirm our own ideas, we would do well to seek out sources that will challenge our preconceptions. For liberal students, the Wall Street Journal opinion pages provide high quality conservative commentary. For the republicans on campus, the New York Times editorials are worth reading, if only to allow for further complaining about the hopelessly biased, liberal media.  Although we are hard-wired to dislike ideas that we do not agree with, those ideas are often the most important ones for us to appreciate, and making a concerted effort to understand them is well worth the effort.Nick M.

Professor Michael J. Sandel is an ambitious man. In an op-ed in <a href=""http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics/if-i-ruled-the-world-michael-sandel/"">Prospect magazine last year, he said that “If I ruled the world, I would rewrite the economics textbooks,” which he thinks is “a small ambition, unworthy of [such a] sovereign office.” After competing with Professor Greg Mankiw for the largest class on campus for many years, it seems like the battleground has moved to textbook sales.Professor Sandel’s objection to economics as a discipline comes from his discomfort at the marketization of public life. In his public <a href=""http://www.ethics.harvard.edu/news-and-events/lectures-and-events/detail/256"">lecture “The Perils of Thinking like an Economist” and his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Money-Cant-Buy-Markets/dp/0374203032"">book “What Money Can’t Buy,” Sandel offers numerous examples of markets that challenge social norms. He claims that these markets, while innocuous in reasoning proposed by economics textbooks, create moral issues in two different ways. First, the expansion of markets causes injustice stemming from wealth inequality. In a world where kidneys can be sold and bought, for instance, wealth inequality could cause health resources to be allocated to the wealthiest rather than the neediest. Second, the formation of markets may alter the nature or character of the good being traded. <a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Incentives_5_9_2011.pdf"">Paying kids to read, for instance, changes their love for knowledge into love for money, which may deter kids from reading for fun. He blames economists for formalizing moral issues like these without consulting moral philosophy, and argues to reduce the role of markets in public life.While I disagree with the moral contention in some of his examples, I agree that these arguments are valid criticism of the unconstrained market. His criticism is not, however, “a big step toward a more civic life” as he claims—because it is already in the very textbooks that he wants to replace.Professor Sandel criticizes economists for applying efficiency arguments to buying and selling kidneys without thinking about its moral consequence. If Sandel cares to talk to any economist at the Harvard Faculty Club, he will find that his colleagues not only think about such moral complexities, but have also devised solutions. Instead of cash incentives, the “<a href=""http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~aroth/alroth.html#KidneyExchange"">kidney exchange” will use an algorithm to swap donated kidneys, so that people who cannot receive donated kidneys from a loved one can still get a donated kidney from a stranger. This can improve efficiency of kidney donation based on the economic principle of coincidence of wants, but not in a morally contentious way. The study of <a href=""http://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/"">markets without financial incentives became such an important subfield of economics that its intellectual godfather, Harvard economist Alvin E. Roth, received the Nobel Prize in Economics last year for this contribution. It is intriguing that in Sandel’s book about economists’ fixation with monetary markets, he forgets to include such alternative markets offered by mainstream economists.More broadly speaking, economists are no strangers to difficult discussions about civic life. The great economists Kenneth J. Arrow and Amartya Sen founded the field of <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1913287"">social choice theory, a mathematical formalism for making collective decisions with consideration of fairness, rights, liberties, and human folly. Of course, such ideas would not be included in Professor Sandel’s hypothetical textbook, because he dismisses the “rigor of natural sciences” in economics as deviant from the discipline’s origin as moral philosophy.
Since its conception, economics has come a long way from a normative political philosophy to a positive social science. David Ricardo and Alfred Marshall systemized the discipline with formal analysis. The introduction of statistical methods connected social theories with reality. Recently, economists have tentatively applied these toolkits to explain phenomena ranging from <a href=""http://www.freakonomics.com/"">family life to social norms. With sufficient and reasonable assumptions, economists can answer difficult questions with a great dose of objectivity and rationality. Given the trajectory of economics to overtake spheres previously governed by moral philosophy, Professor Sandel is justified in questioning the role of a value-free science in public discourse.His criticism, however, is not different from that of a weaver against the sewing machine. A value-free framework offers a platform for discussions driven by scientific consensus. Put simply, before deciding what a society should choose, people must agree on what society will do when given choices. Existing economics textbooks teach the latter, but Professor Sandel would prefer students to learn the former. Given that Sandel prefers to have students arrive at their own conclusion in his Justice class, it is not clear why he would prefer to teach students the moral limits of markets, rather than teach them how to think independently concerning such questions, with sound tools from economics.In his attack on the field of economics, Professor Sandel caricatured the discipline as being narrowly focused on the cost-free transaction of a private good between two rational individuals, a conclusion that would not be surprising if he stopped reading an economics textbook after the first chapter. If Professor Sandel continued reading, he would find that economic thought gives great importance to social cost, as in environmental economics, or justice, as in social choice theory, or market irrationality, as in behavioral economics.Professor Sandel’s book may offer insights about moral concerns in markets, but he chooses to ignore the comprehensive intellectual framework that already addresses his concerns. Instead of rewriting economics textbook altogether, Professor Sandel may make better use of his time picking up the economics textbook that he evidently forgot to finish reading.Jonathan Z.

Students crowded into the Harvard Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday night to watch President Obama deliver his first State of the Union Address since his re-election in November. Obama used the address to outline his second-term strategy and present strong opinions on the economy, research and development, infrastructure, the cost of higher education, immigration reform, and gun control.The President opened with a series of economic proposals focused largely on strengthening the middle class.  He addressed the issue of consistently high levels of unemployment and the need to cut spending and increase taxes on the wealthy in order to reduce the federal deficit. He also stressed the importance of investing in rapidly deteriorating infrastructure to help bolster the American economy. Student impressions of the address were mostly positive.“The speech was more than just rhetoric,” said Simon M. Thompson ’14, president of the Harvard Democrats. “It demonstrated that the President is committed to making our nation stronger.”Brandon D. Moore, a second-year student at the Harvard Kennedy School, said it was exciting “to hear more of an emphasis on issues of poverty.” The President endorsed increasing the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, asserting that the measure would lift millions of Americans above the poverty line.The President also stressed the importance of avoiding “the sequester,” a series of automatic budget cuts that will come into effect on March 1. Republicans and Democrats have yet to agree on how to avoid the cuts, which economists warn could send the economy back into recession. He also addressed the importance of education, pressing for universal, high-quality preschool education and lower costs at universities. He urged Congress to modify the Higher Education Act and use cost as a factor in determining federal aid to universities.
Not all students were wholly impressed with the speech.Matthew J. Disler ’16 was concerned that the President was “trying to implement proposals that Republicans would not be able to get behind.” Although the speech focused predominantly on the economy, Disler said he felt that “gun violence and the Newtown shootings were the high points of the speech.” The President called for increased use of background checks, stating that gun control “deserves a vote” in Congress.Many of the issues the President touched on in the speech, including gun control, have recently provoked partisan contention. The President’s remarks on the need for tax reform and the removal of loopholes for the wealthy, however, brought members of Congress from both parties to their feet.The president’s pledge to sign a bill on comprehensive immigration reform also drew applause from across the aisle. To Thomas J. Gaudett ’14, it was encouraging to see the president “make policy proposals that could be attractive to both sides.”

Harvard Law School alumna and author Susan Cain visited the Harvard Bookstore on Feb. 7 to promote her book “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.” Published in 2012, “Quiet” explores and questions contemporary views on introversion. FM sat down with Cain before she headed home to New York.Fifteen Minutes: “Quiet” argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and that we lose a lot in doing so. How did you get the idea to write about this topic?Susan Cain: Well, I think in many ways I’ve had the idea all my life; since I was a young child I’ve been aware of these dynamics,  although I never had a language for it. I studied here and went off to become a lawyer in New York, and had the idea that to be a good lawyer you had to be a bold, gregarious, swashbuckling kind of person and I knew I wasn’t, so I thought I was at a big disadvantage. But then when I got to the practice of law, I looked around and I realized that many of my colleagues who were best at what they did were introverts. They were quiet and reflective and they were using those traits well.  I thought we needed to have a language for talking about that.FM: Speaking of this language, how would you define the word “introvert”? What are the biggest misconceptions about introverts?SC: You know you’re an introvert if you find yourself needing to recharge your batteries on your own. Imagine that you’ve been at a party for two hours and you’ve had a really good time. At the end of those two hours, do you feel like you’re craving more and you want to stay all night? That’s how extroverts tend to feel. Or do you start to feel depleted? No matter how good a time you’ve had, you might feel depleted, drained of energy. And you get your energy from being in a quieter setting. The misconceptions about introverts are that they’re antisocial, unfriendly, uncaring, and in fact they’re really not—they just want to socialize in quieter ways.
FM: How would you differentiate between introversion and shyness, two often associated words?SC: They’re really not the same, because shyness is about the fear of social judgment. So you could be the kind of person I was describing before—someone who gets their energy from being on their own and needs to recharge that way—without being especially fearful about other people’s opinions. So there’s some overlap, but not completely.FM: Can you explain some of the research surrounding introversion and how science is helping us to better understand introverts?SC: There’s really interesting research on babies being born with different levels of reactivity to stimulation, and the babies who are most reactive to stimulation are the ones who grow up to be introverts because they feel more of the things that are coming at them from the minute they’re born. If you give them sugar water to suck on, they suck on it more dramatically than other kids do. And those same kids, when they’re presented with a new social situation, react more strongly to it.FM: Do you think it’s possible to be a little bit of both—a little introverted and a little extroverted—or to be different in different situations, or is everyone one or the other?SC: I think everybody’s a mix of both. And even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms in the 1920s, said there’s no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert. He said such a man would be in a lunatic asylum.FM: The tagline for your book is “The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.” What is this power, exactly?SC: The power is really many-fold. We know many of the most creative people across time have been introverts because solitude is a crucial ingredient of creativity. We know from management research, interestingly, that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do. So those are two to start with—leadership and creativity.FM: In the introduction of your book, you use Rosa Parks as an example of an introvert who had a quiet but powerful courage. Who are some prominent figures today who you would consider introverted?SC: That’s an interesting question. President Obama, I would guess, is an introvert. Larry Page, at Google, Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo. Those are a few.

“A little ball in the air,” President Eisenhower <a href=""http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=10924"">belittled the Soviet satellite Sputnik after its launch five and half decades ago, but he soon <a href=""http://www.nagc.org/uploadedFiles/Information_and_Resources/Hot_Topics/The%20National%20Defense%20Act.pdf"">committed a billion dollars in response: not for the military but instead the schools. The 1958 National Defense Education Act boasted a hefty budget and a focus on raising math and science proficiency. Today, many have harkened back to that memory, including President Obama, who <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/25/obama-state-of-the-union-_1_n_813478.htmlhttp:/www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2011/01/obamas_sputnik_moment.html"">branded the present day as “our generation’s Sputnik moment” in his 2011 State of the Union address. In a particularly encouraging recent incarnation, Teach For America <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/8/tfa-needs-stem/"">has placed an emphasis on recruiting young teachers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in advance of its February 15 application deadline.The country needs more STEM teachers because it needs more STEM students. The U.S. struggles to cultivate STEM students and professionals at every level. At the elementary school stage, according to the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, the United States <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf"">ranks 9th in eighth grade math and 10th in eighth grade science internationally. When they reach college, those students who do feel competent and compelled enough to declare STEM majors <a href=""http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/stem-complete.pdf"">desert over the next four years a fifty-percent attrition rate. The deficiencies of STEM education then <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/06/15/stem-education-is-the-key-to-the-uss-economic-future"">play out in the labor force: There are two unfilled STEM positions for every STEM worker, versus 3.6 non-STEM workers for every non-STEM position. Even after <a href=""http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/stem-complete.pdf"">controlling for education attainment levels, a significant STEM wage premium remains in the market.TFA’s STEM <a href=""http://www.teachforamerica.org/our-organization/special-initiatives/math-and-science-education-initiative-stem"">initiative, which currently has 3,200 first- and second-year teachers at work, is fighting a worthy but uphill battle—a battle that appears self-perpetuating. As Melissa Moritz, Head of TFA’s STEM initiative put it, “STEM teachers are the hardest to recruit because they have so many options right after graduation.” The wage advantages triggered by too few STEM workers lure away would-be teachers, as shortage begets shortage, with new students missing out on help from teachers trained in science and math. In middle school, over half of math teachers and 60 percent of science teachers <a href=""http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33434.pdf"">have neither a major nor a minor in those subjects. And there are consequences. A 2008 Congressional Research Service report <a href=""http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33434.pdf"">explains that “among those who teach math and science, having a major in the subject taught has a significant positive impact on student achievement.” Efforts like <a href=""http://www.mathforamerica.org/"">Math for America, which addresses the incentive issue via sizable bonuses and four (instead of TFA’s two) base-level years of teaching, offer real hope for progress.This is not to laud STEM education as a national panacea. A liberal arts education and the creativity it may engender remain valuable, and not to be eschewed. Some research <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pits.10072/pdf"">suggests that the American system may have an advantage in cultivating creativity. Still, for long-run economic success and equality, diminished in a world with heavy returns to STEM knowledge yet only a small slice of workers to reap them, the U.S. needs more STEM emphasis. But it also needs more than a reignited Sputnik zeitgeist. It needs specific ideas, it needs solutions, and above all it needs teachers. TFA’s new emphasis is a step in addressing the last of those three. And through the sort of seasoned alumni TFA produces, perhaps the first two as well.

I’ve never had a big, empty stage all to myself before.  It’s a big, vacant stage, really; it looks empty, but it is only artificially so. Underneath the fresh coat of paint it holds all the old dirt and holes, scratches and marks and gestures and breaths from people past. History.I read once that no history of anything will ever contain more than it leaves out. It’s true. People have tried, can try, and will try again. But it’s true.So I’ve got this big vacant stage with History. I suppose this stage, as it is now, will be History too soon enough. And my dirt and holes and scratches and marks, the words that I say and the space that I take up, will be broken down and gone over with a fat brush, and they’ll say, “Wow, that stage was dirty,” or “Look at this big, empty stage I’ve got all to myself.”And now I’ve got less than two minutes all to myself on this stage, which is hardly enough time to explain. But time’s like that, you know? You breathe in and you live and you love and you fight and fight hard to live and love as much as you can in the time you’ve got—then you breathe out.  Soon enough someone will write the books, and maybe they’ll leave you out, their words the fat brush that paints over you, concealing your history from just about everyone. So we all stand up here and fight to make a scratch or a mark deep enough that it can’t be ignored in the hope that someday someone will see it and say, “Wow, she lived hard,” or “Man, what a fight,” and that you will live on in their contemplation. And it doesn’t matter that they don’t understand yet, because they will…in time. Each man will learn what he can from histories and History, and the concerned man will be met with the same fate as one who pays no attention and lives in time as if each moment was the most important moment of his life, thinking nothing of the little scratch or mark he makes on the floor as his feet stride across it, jubilant in his ahistorical bliss.The funny thing is that Time is so finite and also infinite; we feel it intensely in both its expansiveness and constraint, and yet it is intangible. It is all I can do not to laugh when I think of how much and how little time I have, how I’ll probably have just as much as Michelangelo or Camus or Picasso, and how I’ll never feel as though I’ve done enough, fought hard enough, dug deep enough for History to remember all the time I spent here.
And then, maybe I should laugh—when we are constantly confronted with an endless hourglass and somehow sand runs low, what else can we do?  Why not laugh?  I spend so much time slaving away and putting on masks to make this scratch and that mark that I rarely let my true self, whatever that is these days, loose; I rarely let myself run free enough to just throw my head back and laugh. But why? Because it takes too much time? All we’ve got is Time, until we don’t anymore. Use it up, be free, laugh if you can. Because, life? It’s not that serious.—Columnist Megan E.

In the seventeenth century, Harvard students were required to take three years each of Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Syriac as well as demonstrate fluency in Latin as part of their graduation requirements, according to The Crimson.In 1968, the Harvard faculty voted to introduce the one-year language requirement that College students know today. Students can demonstrate their competency at a foreign language through SAT or Advanced Placement scores, or by achieving an adequate result on Harvard’s language placement exams.But for those who still need to fulfill their language requirement, or wish to expand their language capabilities, Harvard consistently offers more than 80 languages each semester. While widely-spoken tongues like Spanish and French attract the most people, students enrolled in obscure language classes say that although those programs may have a smaller presence on campus, Harvard is willing to accommodate their language needs.A NATIONAL LANGUAGE RESOURCE CENTERAs of press time, seventy-seven College students are enrolled in the beginning level French Ab course this semester. One-hundred-and-fifty-three take Spanish Ab. Intermediate Welsh has one student.

Catherine McKenna, chair of the Celtic languages and literatures department and a professor of Welsh, says she thinks students may not immediately be attracted to her class because unlike the highly-enrolled romance languages, it is not “in an English speaker’s comfort zone.”Daniel R. Rafinejad, a language preceptor who teaches beginning Persian, says students may not want to study the language because they have limited access to countries like Afghanistan, Iran, and Tajikistan, where the language is spoken. The elementary Persian class taught by Rafinejad enrolls seven undergraduates.Welsh and Persian are not the only languages to which Harvard devotes resources despite small enrollment numbers. This semester there is one undergraduate each studying  Luganda, Uyghur, and Akkadian.While interest may be small, Harvard does what it can to accommodate those who wish to take uncommon languages.According to professors and students, Harvard will occasionally offer additional language courses if a student demonstrates a curricular or academic need for taking the class.Michael T. Feehly ’14, a history concentrator with an interest in Scandinavian studies, found himself unable to study the Norwegian language because Harvard did not offer classes past the introductory level. Feehly petitioned the Administrative Board to increase Norwegian language offerings, arguing that he needed them to continue his thesis work. Last semester he was the only student enrolled in Norwegian Ba.“It’s literally me and the [teaching fellow] in a room for an hour,” Feehly said in December. “It’s kind of stressful because basically all of the attention is on me.”Harvard’s dedication to supporting obscure language courses has garnered recognition from the federal government. The University has been designated a National Resource Center for Foreign Language, Area, and International Studies under the US Department of Education Title VI, and as a result received $1,184,483 in 2012 to fund languages labeled as “African,” “East Asian,” “Eurasian,” and Middle Eastern.” It will receive the same amount of money for those languages in 2013.“If you can’t study it at a place like Harvard—if you can’t pursue ancient languages, obscure languages like Akkadian..., languages that don’t exist anymore—if Harvard doesn’t teach them, where will they be taught?” says professor Mark C. Elliott, who teaches Manchu.A WORTHWHILE PURSUIT

This week, the world saw an event come to pass for the first time since 1415, igniting widespread mourning, speculation of scandal, and spiritual crises: The Crimson failed to cover a conference basketball game live.Yea, verily I say unto thee, a winter tempest prevented our heroes from emerging from their stronghold city of Cambridge to undertake the long, wicked road to Sheol, or, as it was renamed by its later inhabitants, Ithaca. The incident will remind longtime readers of that early 15th century spring day, when beat writer Sherman the Bold was waylaid on his route to Old Haven by a troop of marauding raiders. “Sword wavin’ Old Haven,” Sherman was said to mutter as he expired on the lonely highway.But we journalists were far from the only Ivy folks thrown off by Nemo’s wrath. In another history lesson, Harvard played a Sunday conference game for the first time since a February 13, 1994 victory at Columbia after Saturday’s contest was postponed due to weather. Once more, the Lions were the foe in New York City, but Columbia did not keep holy the Sabbath, doing irreverent things to the Crimson on its way to a 78-63 drubbing. The loss was all the more sour for Harvard given Princeton’s loss to Yale the day before; the Crimson missed its chance to put some breathing room between itself and the Tigers at the top of the Ivy standings. Now the two are again locked in a death tussle, the first round of which will be decided this Saturday. Let’s get to the games.CORNELL at YALEFollowing the Bulldogs’ stunning road upset of Princeton on Saturday, one might have expected bold fonts and exclamation points from a lesser student newspaper covering the event. But, when greeted by success, every veteran knows the necessity of acting like you’ve been there before. That’s why the Yale Daily News didn’t give the upset its own article, and @YDNsports waited a day before composing an original tweet to acknowledge the victory. No need to spike the football.
Pick: CornellPENN at HARVARDThe Quakers have gone 2-8 in the absence of one of the league’s top forwards, junior Fran Dougherty, who missed a month of action with mononucleosis, returned to action Feb. 1 against Columbia, and promptly dislocated his elbow a game later. Then again, Penn is 3-9 with Dougherty. As long as it contains junior guard Miles Cartwright, this should be a comfortable one for the Crimson—if there is such a thing.Pick: HarvardPRINCETON at DARTMOUTHI suppose it’s possible that the Tigers might be caught looking ahead to the next night’s matchup in Cambridge and forget about their date in Hanover. But I think Princeton could play the whole game facing in a south-southeasterly direction, looking toward Cambridge, and still win this game. I’m taking the Tigers in a rout.Pick: PrincetonCOLUMBIA at BROWNIt was a tough weekend for Brown basketball, which endured two losses by a combined 40 points in its trip to the Killer P’s. Better news for the university is that Kendrick Lamar was announced as the headliner for its spring concert, outdoing Yale’s Spring Fling, which will feature Macklemore as its lead act. I’m preemptively disappointed for whoever is coming to Yardfest—which, to be clear, I blame on the administration’s vision for the event, not on the selection committee. Hey, I hear Dean Dingman’s cousin has a guitar. Maybe he can build some community.Pick: Columbia

With winter sports nearing the end of the season and spring sports getting their season underway, The Back Page takes a look at how some of your teams have been faring in recent weeks. Who has gotten off to a hot start? And who is heading in the right direction just in time to take home an Ivy title?
<a name=""jump"">
Men’s Swimming and Diving
The Crimson is coming off arguably one of the biggest dual meet wins in program history. Harvard topped Princeton in its home waters, the first Ivy League team ever to do so. Nemo pushed the team’s last meet, a face-off against Penn at Blodgett, to this coming weekend. The Crimson will look to remain undefeated on the season as it prepares for the ECAC and Ivy League Championships next month.
Women’s Water Polo
Harvard is off to a 5-2 start this season. The Crimson won all of its opening matches in the Harvard Home Kick Off earlier this month. Despite losing its first two games at the Princeton Invitational, the Crimson bounced back two take its next two contests by a large margin, topping NYAC, 20-9, and Villanova, 19-4. This weekend will be one to rest for the team as Harvard prepares to head to Pennsylvania for the Villanova Invite the following week.
Men’s Volleyball
Despite losing two straight at the turn of the month, the Crimson have been on the rise in February, winning its last two contests by a 3-1 margin. Harvard hopes to carry its momentum into this weekend, when it faces No. 7 Penn State and St. Francis in a pair of match-ups.
Women’s Swimming and Diving
The women capped an undefeated season in dual meets with a 199-99 win over Princeton and a 209-89 routing of Yale last weekend. The team is riding some serious momentum and good vibes as it prepares for the Ivy League and ECAC Championships in two weeks.

In a small discussion group that included Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and consisted primarily of undergraduates, government and African American studies professor Jennifer L. Hochschild argued that racial attitudes change significantly decade to decade, but that these shifts often go unnoticed.The event, which took place in the Widener Library rotunda on Wednesday as part of the Faculty Book Talk Series with Dean Evelynn Hammonds, centered around Hochschild’s book “Creating a New Racial Order: How Immigration, Multiracialism, Genomics, and the Young Can Remake Race in America.”Hochschild said that the book brings a statistical perspective to shifts in racial hierarchy over time in the United States, tracking the changing positions and opinions on race of different groups. She also said that genomics of race are discussed in the work, but to a lesser degree.During the discussion, Hochschild argued that the studies presented in the book demonstrate that racial relations have evolved, even though laws pertaining to race relations have remained relatively unchanged since the end of segregation.Hochschild said that these constantly evolving racial relations impacted her own writing process.
“The world changed an enormous amount in the decade it took to write this,” she said.Hochschild also described the addition or expansion of recognized racial groups that she found in her research. She said that while America’s racial spectrum used to be defined by “a few exhaustive groups,” social divisions are blurred now more than ever in U.S. history.With regard to a public shift in racial opinions and identities, Hothschild said that “there has been a huge reversal.”Since 1958, the number of Americans that approve of interracial marriage has jumped from four to over 80 percent. She pointed to the election of President Obama as a symbol of changing cultural conceptions of racial identity.Hochschild said that in a survey of 4000 college students asking about race or ethnic identity and family descent, 3200 different answers were received. She said that one of the most notable and telling responses included “Latino in some situations,” an answer which she said reflects the fact that racial identity has become a less fixed identifier.Two more discussions in the Faculty Book Talk Series with Dean Evelynn Hammonds remain, one on March 5 and one on April 10, both of which will take place in the Widener Library rotunda.

The Brattle Theater’s dark red awning hangs low on the side of the building that more prominently houses Algiers Coffee House. But this unassuming countenance does little to suggest the small, single-screen movie house’s long influential history. In the 60 years since its opening, the Brattle has helped to transform local film culture, and its influence has extended across the country. Despite ever-increasing competition from multiplex cinemas and the internet, the Brattle, offering everything from recent Hollywood hits to independent foreign documentaries, remains Harvard Square’s only movie theater and one of its most beloved cultural institutions.Let’s Bring Movies BackIn its early years, founders Cyrus I. Harvey ’47 and Bryant N. Halliday ’49 used the theater to promote slightly obscure and underappreciated films to contemporary audiences. At a time when even big Hollywood releases would, after their initial run, be put into storage and forgotten about, the Brattle pioneered the idea of revival cinema. “It helped to launch this idea of ‘let’s bring movies back.’ It introduced these old films to a whole new generation,” says Marianne Lampke, who ran the theater along with Connie White from 1986 until 2001.Starting in the mid-’50s, the Brattle began a yearly tradition of holding a Humphrey Bogart film festival right before the Harvard exam period. Undergraduates would flock to the headline screening of “Casablanca” as a welcome respite from studying. “We still hear stories about it now: The sound went out during a screening but everybody just kept saying the lines anyway, people have proposed to each other in the balcony during “Casablanca,” people used to come dressed up. It was the original ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show,’” says Ned Hinkle, the Brattle’s creative director. Harvard’s “Bogie Cult” sparked similar Bogart sensations at other colleges around the nation.Harvey, who discovered the works of many international directors at the Cinematheque while studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, also wanted to expose American audiences to foreign films. At the Brattle, they screened works of filmmakers from around the world who were relatively obscure in America at the time, though some of their names—Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, and Kurosawa—are widely recognized today. They also founded a distribution company, Janus Films, to distribute foreign films nationwide. “There were a lot of little independent art house theaters in Cambridge at the time, and they all had their little niche. The Brattle’s niche was that they played these great international films,” Hinkle says. Though Janus Films eventually closed when major Hollywood distributors began to take interest in foreign films, foreign films still constitute a large part of the Brattle’s programming.
Vertical ProgrammingIn the mid ’70s, Harvey and Halliday sold the theater, which changed hands multiple times over the next decade. Susan and J.D. Pollack ran the theater in the early ’80s, maintaining the repertory and revival programming philosophy, but jazzing it up with a concession stand and a new balcony. Lampke and White, who both worked at the theater under the Pollacks, took over in 1986. They instituted a strategy they called “vertical programing,” in which they ran a different series each day of the week. “One of the things that we did forever was film noir Mondays. Tuesdays for a while we were doing independent cinema and showing emerging filmmakers. Wednesdays we had a series for a long time called Recent Raves,” said Lampke. “We were trying to keep it rotating so that each night of the week new audiences would come.”The Recent Raves series continued Harvey and Halliday’s desire to give audiences another chance to see films that had already been retired from first-run theaters. After the Kendall Square Theater opened, however, which kept first-run movies running for longer periods than the Brattle, the market for second-run films at the Brattle declined. Lampke and White also continued their predecessors’ practice of seeking out contemporary foreign films not yet widely screened in the U.S., such as Japanese anime films and Jackie Chan’s Hong Kong action flicks. “Those films were really drawing a student audience,” said Lampke.An ‘Indefinable Experience’Hinkle and Ivy Moylan, former employees of Lampke and White, have run the Brattle since 2001. Though movie theater attendance has been dropping everywhere since the mid ’90s, in the past couple of years their attendance numbers have defied the national trend and actually increased by a small percentage.Hinkle and Moylan are also working towards major technological changes—they’ve started a kickstarter campaign to raise money for a new digital projection and a new air conditioning system. The Brattle used to emphasize the advantage of seeing a movie on film stock, but now, as many major releases are not even released on celluloid, they want an upgrade so as not to limit their programming. “We’ll continue to play old movies and we’ll continue to play movies on film, but we have to be able to play everything,” said Hinkle.For Hinkle, going to a theater at all is an undervalued experience. “I think there are movies that are being done a disservice by people who only watch them at home because when you see something with a crowd, even if there are only 10 other people in the theater, you have this indefinable experience where your reaction is bouncing off of other people’s and vice versa,” said Hinkle. “A funny movie is funnier, a scary movie is scarier.”

Remember Valentine’s Day in second grade? When you stuffed your SpongeBob “I love you squar-ey much” cards into the glittered shoebox of each one of your classmates? You made Valentine’s Day cards out of pink construction paper for your parents, and you gave your very bestest friend an extra special treat outside of school to renew your “best friends 4 life” vows. This may not be true for everyone—especially the guys—but for the most part, this is how I remember elementary school Valentine’s Day playing out. To this day, I fondly recall that Valentine’s Day of yesteryear. As we grow up, however, we find that Valentine’s Day morphs into a slightly different holiday with quite different connotations.As history buffs may know, Valentine’s Day commemorates the life of a Christian saint named Valentinus, who was martyred in A.D. 296. The holiday didn’t actually have any romantic associations attached to it until a millennium later, when poet <a href=""http://www.technicianonline.com/features/article_1f93aca8-7409-11e2-a6ee-0019bb30f31a.html"">Geoffrey Chaucer wrote “Parlement of Foules” to honor the anniversary of King Richard II and Anne of Bohemia. Now, centuries after that, there is much build-up to what has become a “Hallmark holiday”: People in relationships feel pressure to plan something romantic, people in pseudo-relationships wonder if it is too soon or crossing the line to speak to their (in)significant others on the 14th, and people not in relationships watch “Love Actually,” eat chocolate, and paint their nails black (at least from what I’ve gathered).Despite these tropes, Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be spent with (or fantasizing about) someone in the romantic realm. It can double as a day to think about the underappreciated relationships we have in our lives. We can take the time to cherish the bonds we’ve established with our parents and grandparents, friends who listen to all of our drama again and again, people back home whom we haven’t spoken to in a few years, the middle school teacher that sparked our interest in writing, and even the guitar player we stop to listen to on evenings out in the square.If you are one of the Harvard students who has found love in a hopeless place, you can rightfully expect a little extra TLC on this specific day. But remember that good can also come from paying the excess love forward to someone who doesn’t receive the same kind of appreciation. While I personally haven’t really celebrated Valentine’s Day since my fifth grade plaid jumper days, I do take the holiday as a reminder that, regardless of the day of the year or the occasion, I should take more opportunities to show my appreciation for all of the valuable relationships in my life.At times, we can get wrapped up in our own busy schedules, constantly running from meeting to meeting and class to class. Even lunch with good friends may occupy only a predetermined time block, and a phone call can only last as long as it takes to get from the dining hall to the Science Center. In the midst of the chaos of the semester, we sometimes forget that everyone—friends, acquaintances, classmates, and strangers—has a story worth listening to.  If we are too busy to take a little time out of our day to be a part of someone else’s, then we are missing out on much of the richness of life. So while some of us may indulge in the greeting card traditions of Valentine’s Day, we can also reconnect with our childhood version of the holiday. Then, once again, we can have multiple Valentines and multiple ways of telling people how much we care about them.

Days after Harvard <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/1/cheating-scandal-smith-withdraw/"">announced the results of its massive Government 1310 cheating investigation, lawyers who have consulted with accused students say the door is still open for legal challenges against the University.Attorneys interviewed for this article acknowledged that litigation would be difficult because of the apparently scrupulous nature of Harvard’s investigation and its status as a private institution. Still, they say, the statute of limitations leaves ample time for specific student grievances to emerge.Last August, Harvard <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/"">announced that it was investigating about 125 students for inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in last spring’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” course.During an investigation which spanned the fall semester, more than half of the accused undergraduates—approximately 70 students—were asked to temporarily withdraw from the College. An additional quarter of investigated students were put on probation.The University has not publicly indicated whether it has faced any litigation connected with the scandal.
When the scandal broke last fall, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/10/possible-lawsuits-cheating-scandal/"">lawyers speculated that lawsuits stemming from the scandal would hinge on whether the Administrative Board adhered to its procedures as described in the student handbook.Now that the investigation is complete, attorneys say that the Ad Board appeared to closely follow its delineated rules throughout the probe, making lawsuits less likely.In addition, they say, Harvard’s status as a private institution makes it difficult for students to sue the University after a disciplinary proceeding.Michael R. Schneider, a Boston lawyer who has consulted with several undergraduates accused in the scandal, said that disciplined students face an uphill battle when they bring civil cases against private universities.“In general, there are very few of these cases that make it into the court system,” Schneider said. “The only meaningful vehicle that usually survives in court is a claim of breach of contract.”In this scenario, he said, a student would have to demonstrate that the University had committed “a very specific breach of a particular provision that had a damaging, negative impact on the final result.”In Massachusetts, such cases require a heavy burden of proof on the part of the student, according to Harvey A. Silverglate, a Cambridge lawyer who has advised Harvard students facing Ad Board investigations since the late 1960s.Silverglate said that Schaer vs. Brandeis University, a case heard by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 2000, sets a high bar for students who want to sue private universities. In the case, a student sued Brandeis for failing to adhere to its official procedures in a sexual assault investigation. The court ruled in favor of Brandeis, a private institution, on the grounds that universities are “not required to adhere to the standards of due process” used in criminal or civil courts.“Schaer vs. Brandeis makes Harvard very close to invulnerable,” Silverglate said.Despite these hurdles to student litigation, lawyers emphasized that lawsuits may still have enough heft and time to come to light.

The humanities reigned in the latest round of concentration satisfaction ratings, followed closely by the social sciences and life sciences. As was the case in previous years, smaller concentrations generally outperformed larger ones in the survey, which is taken every spring by graduating seniors.Women, Gender, and Sexuality achieved the highest satisfaction rate among members of the Class of 2012 with a 4.78 out of 5. Only nine graduating seniors last year concentrated in WGS.“Our students receive a lot of one-on-one attention,” said director of undergraduate studies in WGS Caroline Light.Government and Economics, which boast two of the largest pools of concentrators in the College, placed in the bottom five in the most recent ratings.The results did not surprise the government department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch, who said that satisfaction is usually inversely correlated with the size of the department.
“That doesn’t mean that a big department can’t do better,” Welch said.The government department is in the process of implementing changes in the advising system that were approved last year, but it has been too soon, Welch said, to see their impact reflected on the satisfaction survey.But according to Jeffrey Miron, director of undergraduate studies for the economics department, concentration size may not be the only factor behind the student satisfaction.“I think some majors tend to get students because the students love those disciplines, and other majors get students because it’s a useful thing to do, and it’s probably going to be useful in terms of getting a job,” Miron said.MOVERS AND SHAKERSIn last year’s survey, several humanities concentrations experienced jumps in ratings, while the average score of life science concentrations has decreased.History and Literature and English—the two largest humanities departments—both scored above a 4.1 out of 5 in the concentration satisfaction surveys.History and Literature has seen a steady upward trend in the past 3 years, which Jon W. Oakes ’13 credits to small class and tutorial sizes. Other humanities departments, including Literature, Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and Architecture, and Comparative Study of Religion, all scored at least a 4.2.East Asian Studies saw the greatest increase in ratings—from 4.18 to 4.58. The department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Michael Szonyi attributes the jump to recent efforts to develop a sense of community within the department.On the other hand, life sciences’ average satisfaction score has decreased steadily from 4.31 in 2010 to 4.14 this past year. Faculty and concentration advisers in the life sciences said they hope to maintain and improve the experiences of their concentrators, while noting their jump in ratings relative to their scores from a decade earlier. Between 2009 and 2010, the mean rating shot up from 3.52 to 4.14 after the splintering of the life sciences into what are now nine specialized concentrations.

As the population on Earth continues to grow, Harvard scientists may have just stumbled upon some additional space—in the solar system. Earth-like planets, defined by the researchers as planets comparable in size and temperature to Earth, may be as close as 13 light years away, according a study conducted by third-year graduate student Courtney D. Dressing and astronomy professor David Charbonneau.Using public data available from NASA’s Kepler mission, a project tasked with measuring changes in the brightness of stars, Dressing set out to “find out how common planets like the earth are in the galaxy.”Dressing and Charbonneau searched the orbits of red dwarf stars—the most commonly found stars in the Milky Way galaxy—for planets similar in size and temperature to Earth.By measuring the extent to which a planet eclipsed the light of a nearby star, the researchers discovered that about six percent of red dwarf stars have earth-like planets in their orbits. Red dwarf stars are both smaller and cooler than the Sun.According to Dressing and Charbonneau, based on the results of the study, the search for habitable planets may be far more fruitful than previously thought.
Charbonneau said the next step in their research is to ascertain which of these earth-like planets is the closest to Earth. After this, both he and Dressing hope to conduct further research about life on these planets—a plan that is contingent upon the completion of a large telescope, most likely the Giant Magellan Telescope that is currently under construction in Chile.The GMT will “be one of the next class of super giant earth-based telescopes that promises to revolutionize our view and understanding of the universe,” according to the telescope’s official website. The project has a planned end date of 2023.According to the researchers, these later phases of the study, once complete, might allow for scientists to continue the search for potential extraterrestrial life forms.“What everybody really wants to know is: are we alone?” Charbonneau said. “[Dressing’s] discovery is a very important step toward answering that question.”—Staff writer Jessica A.

In a town hall meeting entitled “All About the X,” dozens of faculty members from across Harvard’s schools gathered to learn more about ongoing online course development and research at HarvardX, the subset of EdX courses and technologies taught and developed by Harvard faculty.“I wanted to make it clear to faculty about how much of an opportunity this is to think creatively about their whole process of teaching and learning,” said Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX. “How often do you see folks convening together around an idea from FAS, the Kennedy School, the Design School, the Medical School, and the School of Public Health?”At the meeting, members of the HarvardX team presented a how-to guide for creating EdX modules. For example, Marlon Kuzmick, associate director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, showed professors how to integrate video into their modules.Currently, lecture capture studios allow professors to simulate the classroom experience when recording lessons. According to Kuzmick, devices that project images of a person’s face over a teleprompter can facilitate more personable performances from faculty when they speak to the camera.Katie L. Vale, FAS Director of Academic Technology, summarized the infrastructure of the EdX platform and showed how a student would experience a newly-created module.
Following Vale, Andrew D. Ho, chair of the HarvardX Research Committee, presented the ways in which the committee can help professors evaluate analytics from the online course platform.Finally, lecturer David J. Malan ’99 spoke about his first few months as an instructor of CS50x: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” for which over 140,000 students registered.“One of the greatest takeaways of participating in EdX was the imperative mandate to take the course to the next level, doing the initiatives we had envisioned technologically and pedagogically, and then applying them back to the on-campus students,” Malan said.In the final open discussion, faculty asked specific questions regarding assessment for humanities courses, the incorporation of hands-on learning in online classes, and HarvardX’s cost and revenue models.In the end, the HarvardX team encouraged interested professors to utilize the infrastructure already in place and to submit course ideas to be voted on by the HarvardX Faculty Committee.“We want to engage more faculty, more broadly. This is not a situation where we’ll say, ‘Oh, now we’re full, we should stop now,’” Lue said. “We’re definitely building capacity.”—Staff writer Amna Hashmi can be reached at amnahashmi@college.harvard.edu.

With the Inn at Harvard slated to become swing housing for Dunster House students during house renewal in 2014, an undetermined number of the Inn’s employees face potential layoffs.Currently, there are approximately 65 employees working at the Inn at Harvard, which is scheduled to close on July 15.The Inn at Harvard is operated by Collegiate Hospitality, LLC, a company which also manages the Harvard Square Hotel. Both of those assets are owned by Harvard University, according to Collegiate Hospitality’s website.“We’re working with the state of Massachusetts and Harvard University to reemploy a number of employees between now and July 15,” said Collegiate Hospitality CEO Richard Carbone.For those employees that do not get reemployed, Collegiate Hospitality has been working to create severance packages. Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, declined to comment on whether Harvard was funding the severance packages.
Lisa Hogarty, Harvard vice president for campus service said that Harvard is providing services to help the Inn’s employees in obtaining another job.“We’ve offered coaching support for employees needing help writing a resume,” Hogarty said. She added that as more jobs become available in the summer, Harvard “will flag those positions for these employees and offer them priority.”Hogarty said that, ultimately, the house renewal project will create more jobs than it costs.“We anticipate over the course of a decade we will generate almost 3600 jobs,” Hogarty said, noting that this number includes construction workers, support staff, consultants, designers, and engineers.Before students move in, the Inn at Harvard will be transformed to include a dining hall, kitchen, and additional study spaces.After Dunster renewal is completed, Hogarty said the Inn will continue to serve as swing housing for each house as it goes through renovations.Harvard University Dining Services employees and Harvard Facilities Maintenance Operations staff will move with the students, working at the Inn at Harvard while the House in which they usually work is under construction.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: February 20, 2013, at 10:35 a.m.A Harvard researcher has found that typically African-American names are more likely to be linked to a criminal record in Google-generated advertisements on the online search engine and on the news site Reuters.com, a website to which Google supplies advertisements.Latanya Sweeney, director of the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard, began her research after a colleague, government department fellow Adam Tanner, told her that his Google search of her name had generated an advertisement that read: “Latanya Sweeney: arrested.”In disbelief, Sweeney began poking around online and found that advertisements from criminal records site InstantCheckmate.com incorrectly suggested that she had an arrest history. The two then plugged Tanner’s name into Google and, to the pair’s surprise, it generated a neutral InstantCheckmate ad that did not hint at a criminal record.“Adam jumped to the conclusion that [the advertisements] were coming up on Black-sounding names,” said Sweeney. “I spent hours trying to show him that he was wrong and couldn’t.”
Thus began the start of a research study, which was partially funded by Google, that involved extensive combing of the Internet and numerous databases. Sweeney’s research paper summarizing her findings is slated for publication in an academic journal.First, Sweeney identified typically African-American names using a database that compiled first names given disproportionately to babies of one racial identity over another. She then paired the first names with last names by identifying real professionals with academic qualifications—medical doctors, for example—and verified their racial identities with Google Image search results. Finally, using a sample of typically Caucasian and typically African American names, she ran analysis on search results.According to Sweeney, Google maintains that it cannot predict which advertisements—positive or negative—will be most popular, so advertisements are initially distributed at random. However, in searches of typically African-American names on Google and Reuters.com, Sweeney found between 81 to 95 percent of generated ads suggested an arrest.“It is an interesting mirror of society,” said Sweeney, “that the Internet, which started out neutral, has begun to show racial bias.”When asked for comment, Google spokesperson Aaron J. Stein wrote in an email that AdWords, Google's profitable advertising product, does not engage in racial profiling.“We also have a policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organization, person or group of people,” Stein wrote. “It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads.”Reuters.com could not immediately be reached for comment on Sweeney’s study Wednesday evening.Sweeney said there are two possible reasons for the seemingly biased results: Google’s computer-generated algorithm may be unintentionally skewed, or Google users may choose to more frequently click on arrest advertisements that come up for black names over white names.Gary King, director of the Institute for Qualitative Social Science at Harvard, wrote in an email that isolating the cause of the skewed search results will determine the next steps for researchers.“Laying out the patterns, as Latanya is doing, and then ascertaining its causes and effects, is very important,” King wrote.—Staff writer Anneli L.

Heading into the weekend, the Crimson looked to be on a roll. They had won 11 of their last 14 games, with the three losses coming to 2012 tournament teams—Memphis, St. Mary’s, and Connecticut. All three games were on the road, and in each Harvard was in the game late into the second half.The Crimson was 4-0 in the Ivy League, holding on by the skin of its teeth, but still displaying that “clutch” factor at the end of games. Leads shrank and Lavietes Pavillion grew restless, but Harvard always seemed to hang on. Last Friday’s game at Cornell was more of the same—the Crimson led by as much as 21, but didn’t score for the final 5:42 and won by just two points.And then came Columbia.The Lions came out on Sunday and blitzed Harvard. Guard Steve Frankowski scored 27 points—20 coming in the first half—and Columbia shot a blistering 51 percent from the field and 53 percent from behind the arc. The lions beat the Crimson on the glass (four more offensive rebounds, eight more overall), played better team ball (18 assists to six), and took better care of the ball (three fewer turnovers). The result: a 15-point victory that Harvard fans should have seen coming.Getting away by the skin of your teeth time after time is not a viable strategy for long-term success. In Harvard’s first five Ivy League games, it was twice down double-digits late before waking up just in time (Dartmouth on the road and again at home), and thrice nearly blew late double-digit leads with poor free throw shooting down the stretch (Brown, Cornell, Yale). Down the stretch, those teams revealed Harvard’s vulnerability and showed the Ivy League race to be wide open.
The Crimson offense consists of four roving perimeter players with a big man rotating in the middle and establishing good post position. The strategy is dependent on Harvard’s lights-out shooters. The team shoots a combined 41 percent from three and guards Wesley Saunders and Siyani Chambers both shoot better than 46 percent from that range. But when the jump shots aren’t falling, the Crimson struggles to put points on the board.In the two teams’ second meeting, Dartmouth employed an aggressive man-to-man defense against Harvard and contained sharpshooter Laurent Rivard, who shot just one for seven from three on the day. The entire team made a combined five of 21 shots from distance.The way to break man-to-man defense is with offensive players who can take their men off the dribble and get to the middle. The Crimson has two guards who do so consistently—Chambers and Saunders. However, when either one of the two is out, the team struggles to create offense and often ends possessions with ill-advised threes.Chambers’ worrying foul tendency amplifies this problem. He picked up four in the second Dartmouth game and would have fouled out late if not for an overturned call. Against Brown, his four early fouls limited him to 28 minutes and the offense struggled without him. Against Memphis, Chambers’ fifth foul coincided with the Tigers’ 12-2 run to finish the game.With Harvard boasting a cushy two-game lead against the non-Princeton Ancient Eight field, it is easy to look at the schedule as “the two Princeton games and everything else”. After all, with the Tigers only a half-game back of the Crimson, Harvard likely needs to defeat Princeton at least once.However, three games stand out on the schedule besides those played against the Tigers. Friday’s game against Penn looms as a classic trap game the day before the highly anticipated matchup with a hated rival.The week after, road games at Brown and Yale—teams whom Harvard was already lucky to escape from once—may very well decide the Ivy League outcome. And then there’s the trip to Jadwin, where Princeton lost Saturday for the first time in three years.Harvard has not yet played a 40-minute game of good basketball against an Ivy League team. The Crimson is 4-6 on the road with four Ivy League road games still to be played. However, the team has two great opportunities to take control of the Ivy League this weekend. But should it neglect to capitalize, Harvard might find itself looking up in the standings for the rest of the year. —Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

The bend-but-don’t-break strategy finally caught up with the Harvard men’s basketball team.After winning its first five Ivy League contests by an average margin of 5.4 points, the Crimson fell to Columbia by 15 on Sunday, failing to capitalize on an opportunity to go up 1.5 games on Princeton in the conference standings.“I think there’s a lot of disappointment in how we played against Columbia, there’s no question about it,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose team was outshot 50.9 to 42.9 percent by the Lions. “We’ve lost some tough games, and this last one was a little bit of a head scratcher.”The Crimson doesn’t have much time to get its act together, as Harvard (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) welcomes Penn (5-17, 2-3) and Princeton (11-8, 4-1) to Lavietes Pavilion this weekend.The Crimson has failed to sweep a Penn-Princeton weekend in seven of its last eight opportunities.
Part of the difficulty may stem from the teams’ contrasting styles. While Princeton boasts one of the conference’s biggest lineup, starting five players 6’5” or taller, Penn relies more heavily on its athleticism.“We really try to prepare for both teams in practice,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “But most importantly, we just try to focus on us and not really get caught up in what the other team does. We feel like if we do what we do effectively and execute, then that will take care of itself.”Assuming both Harvard and Princeton take care of business on Friday night against Penn and Dartmouth, respectively, Saturday’s matchup between the Crimson and Tigers will determine the Ivy League favorite heading into the second half of conference play.The preseason pick to win the Ancient Eight, Princeton has the league’s top defense as well as the conference’s top forward—6’7” senior Ian Hummer.The Crimson, which starts four perimeter players, has struggled to contain talented bigs this season. In back-to-back contests in early December, Harvard surrendered 23 points to both 6’8” BC forward Ryan Anderson and 6’8” UConn forward DeAndre Daniels.Within the Ivy League, Harvard has fared better against its stiffest post competition. In two games against Dartmouth, 6’9” forward Gabas Maldunas was held below his season scoring average—though the sophomore did connect on seven of 13 attempts.But Hummer is a different beast. The preseason favorite for Ivy Player of the Year, Hummer has done it all for Princeton this season, as his 15.7 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists are good for tops on the Tigers and second, fourth, and third in the conference, respectively.As impressive as Hummer’s numbers have been, the Crimson needs only to remember its past matchups with the Tigers to know the problems Hummer presents. In five contests against Harvard over the past two seasons, Hummer has averaged 15.2 points.“We haven’t had an answer for him through the years,” Amaker said. “He’s very rugged, very physical, but yet he’s fluid enough to be on the perimeter.”“He’s a nightmare of a matchup, so we’re going to have our hands full again,” continued Amaker, who added that the Crimson may throw a handful of different defenders at Hummer.

In a new weekly series by The Back Page, Harvard beat writers will discuss topics about a Crimson athletics team. In this edition, basketball beat writers Hope Schwartz and David Freed discussed the men’s basketball team’s future in the Ivy League as well as their frontcourt rotation and ability to close out games.
Cordelia F. Mendez: The team is facing its second road weekend of the season and will have to meet its most difficult opponent, Princeton. How can Harvard even hope to stop or slow down the Tigers given that they put up a program-high 99 points last week?<a name=""jump"">
Samantha Lin: Princeton is clearly coming off of a high following its 46-point rout of Yale, a team that Harvard bested by less than a third of that margin. Look for its attack to come from Niveen Rasheed, a senior guard who put up 29 points against the Bulldogs and has yet to score in single digits in league play. I think that if the Crimson is able to slow Rasheed, the team has the potential to pull off this upset. Who do you think will be assigned this task?
CFM: Princeton is exceptionally good at holding their opponents down. No Ivy squad has lost by less than 30 points to them, and at 6'0"", Rasheed is certainly a guard to contend with. Harvard will need to provide pressure in the paint with taller players like 6'4"" Temi Fagbenle and 6'0"" Victoria Lippert. Convincing double-digit scoring performances from Fagbenle in her last three games have elevated the Crimson over Ancient Eight foes. Speaking of the Ancient Eight, it's too easy to ignore Penn and playing at the Palestra. What should the Crimson do to make sure they don't repeat blowing its second half lead against a weaker opponent? 
SL: You can never count Penn out. At only a game behind Harvard, the Quakers are definitely still in the hunt for an Ivy title. They are clearly a team that improves in the second half, too—they’ve outscored all of their Ancient Eight rivals in the second half all year, even in their loss to Yale last weekend, while the Crimson seems quick to start but struggles down the stretch. Keeping the ball away from the opponent will be key against Penn and Princeton; 17 turnovers against teams like those can cost victories. Last year's team coughed it up 15 times in a tough loss against the Tigers. What are your predictions for this weekend, given the performance by the Crimson on Sunday and Princeton's seven-game winning streak? 
CFM: My thoughts? Harvard over the Quakers by seven, especially if Christine Clark, Fagbenle and Lippert are really on. The Quakers are weak behind the arc, and if the Crimson can find some magic from Emma Golen, this should be a pretty solid W. I'm going to have to go with Princeton over Harvard, though. Playing at Jadwin isn't easy for any visitor, and against the hot-handed Tigers, it will be a tough task for the Crimson. The women of Harvard basketball can hope to take some of the good karma that Yale’s men's basketball team had when it upset the home favorites. What are your predictions?
SL: I'm going to take Harvard by 10 in its opener for the weekend. A solid 5-inch advantage that our starting lineup has over Penn's should help Harvard dominate the inside, even if the treys aren't falling (which could very well happen, considering the 3-for-18 performance the Crimson displayed against the Big Red). But if Rasheed and company defend their home territory and play with the same intensity that they've shown throughout league play thus far, I think Harvard may have some trouble in Jersey this Saturday. Princeton by 10 at home.

On the road this weekend, the Harvard women’s basketball team will have a chance to unseat the champions.After stopping at the Palestra on Friday to take on Penn (10-9, 3-2 Ivy), the Crimson (13-6, 4-1) will come face to face with Princeton (14-5, 5-0)—which has won three consecutive Ivy League titles—at Jadwin Gymnasium on Saturday.Although Harvard swept the Quakers last year, the team has not beaten the Tigers since 2011 and has not taken both road games in the same season since 2009.“The mindset of the team is that we are mentally and physically ready to go,” said co-captain and forward Miriam Rutzen. “We are ready to play whoever our competition is, no matter what the name is on the front of the jersey.”On the road trip, the Crimson will square off against the two best defensive teams in the league. Princeton has allowed only 54.4 points per game, while Penn has allowed 56.8.
Harvard—the second-highest scoring team in the league with 68.6 points per game—will look towards offensive leader Christine Clark. The junior guard leads the team with 16.6 points per game.In addition to Clark, the Crimson has relied on a number of other sources to break down its opponents’ defense.s Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle has been a force in the paint, putting up a career-high 20 points on 75-percent shooting at Yale earlier this month.Accounting for more than three treys per game, co-captain Emma Golen and senior forward Victoria Lippert have led the way from the perimeter, each shooting over 40 percent.“We know that Penn and Princeton are going to play similar games in that they are very defensively aggressive,” Golen said.For the Quakers, junior guard Alyssa Baron leads the way with 14 points per game, but she is shooting only 37 percent from the field. Penn has struggled to find the net with consistency, shooting 35 percent as a team—good for sixth in the league.The Quakers have benefited from tight ball control, forcing more turnovers than their opponents by a league leading 2.89 average margin.“You can never take any team or any game for granted in the Ivy League, whether you are playing the team with the best record or the worst record,” Rutzen said. “We have continued to get better and grow as a team in how we handle games that are tough.”Against Princeton, the Crimson will look to control offensive powerhouse Niveen Rasheed. The senior guard leads the Ivy League with 16.9 points per game, and her 9.2 boards per game have helped to make the Tigers the top rebounding team in the conference.Rasheed is the only Princeton player to average double digit points, and she has been spelled by junior forward Kristen Helmsetter, who chips in 9 points per game.“We’re just going to try to limit [Rasheed] as much as we can and make sure she gets no easy looks,” Golen said.     “After that, they’re all pretty even as offensive threats, so we just need to focus on our matchups.”

Tomorrow is February 14th, which means that it is Single Appreciation Day or SAD—not to be confused with Seasonal Affective Disorder. SAD is the time to celebrate your singleness regardless of any vitamin D deficiencies. So here are a few things that you can do to ensure that you have a happy SAD.<!--more-->1. Make it Facebook OfficialChange your relationship status from single…to single. Or, if as in my case, you are currently in a ""relationship"" with a platonic friend, change it from sister-wife to single. You should also change your profile picture to something that involves a mirror or you hugging yourself from behind.2. Go ""Shopping""
Go to CVS and calculate the cost of the chocolates, singing-cards, and general hygiene products that you would have had to buy if you actually had a Valentine. Depending on how active your sweat glands are, you may have saved as much as 20 dollars! Congratulate yourself—your singleness has made you fiscally responsible.3. Treat YourselfTake that money that you would have spent on deodorant and stimulate the economy by taking yourself to a nice restaurant. Proudly ask the hostess for a table for one and a kids' menu so that you can play tic-tac-toe and write haikus to yourself. Don't forget that ""forever alone"" has five syllables!4.

Students at the Harvard Kennedy School became Harvard’s second student body to vote yes on a referendum question supporting responsible investment of the University’s endowment.In a student election held on Monday and Tuesday, 93 percent of Kennedy School voters approved the referendum question, which calls for the University to seed its planned social choice fund with .1 percent—roughly $30 million—of its $30.7 billion endowment.Nearly half of the Kennedy School’s approximately 1,000 students cast ballots in the election.Kennedy School student David J. Garfunkel—a member of the Responsible Investment @ HKS leadership team, which coordinated the referendum question—said he and other organizers are “really thrilled about the turnout.”Although the ballot question drew overwhelming student support, it is unclear what, if any, effect the referendum will have on University policy. The University has not indicated whether it will draw any funds from its existing endowment to jumpstart the new fund, which will be launched on July 1.
This past November, the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition—the parent organization of Responsible Investment @ HKS—coordinated a similar student referendum at the College. In that election, 80.5 percent of undergraduate voters cast ballots in support of the establishment of a social choice endowment fund.Prior to the Kennedy School’s referendum vote, organizers said that school-wide support of the measure would be a talking point in further discussion with administrators.“We hope to communicate the results to the administration and to make it known that this is an issue that goes beyond just College students, but also grad students,” Kennedy School student Alexander “Alexi” White, a member of the Responsible Investment at Harvard leadership team, said last week.Responsible Investment @ HKS plans to motivate fellow Harvard Harvard graduate schools to partake in a social choice coalition.“As our movement grows in strength, we kind of want to add to the unified voice of Harvard students,” Garfunkel said.Garfunkel said that the social choice fund presents the University with an opportunity of historic magnitude.“Harvard is a worldwide leader when it comes to so many other issues. There’s no reason to think that responsible investment needs to be any different,” Garfunkel said. “We really want to encourage the administration to capitalize on the first step that they’ve taken and to really take the lead.”—Staff writer Steven R.

As Harvard embraces digital learning with the launch of online education platform EdX, professors in traditional Harvard classrooms are asking undergraduates to keep off of laptops and on task during class, hoping to eliminate the temptation to surf the Internet.“I didn’t used to [ban laptops], but it just became clearer and clearer that it was sort of an open secret that everybody used their laptops and the Internet in ways we all know they do in class,” said Samuel Zipp, a visiting professor of history from Brown University. Zipp does not allow laptops in his course History 1450: “The United States Metropolis, 1945-2000.”There is no College policy on the use of laptops in class, according to Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Instead, individual faculty members make their own policies.But Alison Simmons, a professor of philosophy, said that more professors are discussing how to address the rise of laptop use in class.“We’re all talking about it,” said Simmons. “You can’t go to a faculty meeting or a dinner party where it doesn’t come up.”
Simmons does not allow laptop use in lecture with exceptions for approved reasons, a policy she wrote last year. Though she acknowledges that there are benefits to having a laptop in class—the ability to look at texts that are available online, for example—Simmons said she instituted the laptop ban because they can be distracting, both because of the temptation to surf the Internet and from the sounds of other students typing.Taking notes on a laptop might also cause students to focus on taking everything down instead of synthesizing concepts, she said.“It’s not simple or straightforward, but at the moment, I think the arguments in favor of disallowing them outweigh [allowing them],” Simmons said.Zipp said laptops can disrupt the connection between student and professor.“I’m interested in creating a reciprocal relationship [with students], and sometimes that’s hard in a lecture as it stands,” Zipp said. “I think that the Internet makes it harder.”Both Simmons and Zipp wondered what the impact would be on the classroom if instructors could turn off Internet access in their lectures so that students could take notes on their laptops without online distractions.Some students think there is value in taking notes on laptops, despite the risk of distraction.Henry J. Limitone ’16 said laptops should be allowed in lecture classes.This fall as a student in Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice,” Limitone starting taking notes on his laptop because he discovered he could not write quickly enough. A few weeks later when professor Michael J. Sandel told students they could not use their laptops, Limitone said he felt that it was a disadvantage.“Inevitably, you’re going to have students who abuse [laptops],” Limitone said. “I don’t think professors should try and put rules in place that aim to make you a better student. We’re 18 years old, 19 years old—we should be able to make the right decision and not abuse the laptop in class.”—Staff writer Madeline R. Conway can be reached at mconway@college.harvard.edu.

From applicants living in Asia to military personnel who are on active duty, qualified prospective students for Harvard Law School were interviewed through the free videoconferencing software Skype for the first time.“The technology is working even better than we had hoped,” said Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer and former Crimson business editor Jessica L. Soban ’02. “We’ve gotten great feedback from those that we’ve interviewed which has been really encouraging for us.”Along with Soban, Harvard Law School Director of Admissions Karen E. Buttenbaum is also conducting interviews, which have occurred on a rolling basis since November.“We have found it a really valuable part of our process,” Soban said. “Phone’s hard. You don’t get to see me nod, and I don’t get to see the other person smile. That’s the kind of stuff that makes for a really human interaction, and I think that it was missing from the phone interview.”Soban said that the Law School aims to invite 1,200 students to interview in the new format by the end of this year’s admissions cycle, compared to 1,000 candidates who were interviewed via phone last year.
If a candidate is unable to interview via Skype, the Law School admissions office is prepared to offer special accommodations, which so far have not been needed.Already one of only a small number of law schools to conduct interviews, Harvard joins a select few to offer videoconferencing, Soban said.Second year Law School student Claire M. Guehenno ’09, a former Crimson news editor, said she appreciated having an interview for Harvard. “Especially for such a big school, it makes you much more connected to the admissions process,” she said.Soban admitted that interviewing via Skype has its imperfections.“The more you do it, the more it starts to feel like a really personal interaction, but it can be awkward when you’re first getting to know how to use the technology,” she said.Third year Law School student Benjamin Schultz said that videoconferencing was not common enough to ensure that candidates felt comfortable in that setting.“People have a certain idea of how to conduct themselves in a phone interview, but Skype is not widespread enough to have the same effect,” he said.Guehenno said that she had mixed feelings about the use of Skype as an interview medium.“In some ways it’s more awkward [than a phone interview] since you have to worry about how you look and where you are sitting,” she said. “But there are some advantages to Skype because it makes it more personal. It more accurately depicts what an interview process is like in real life.”Soban said that she anticipates that the practice of conducting interviews through Skype will continue at the Law School for at least the next several years.—Staff writer Dev A.

To make a run at the Ivy League title, the Harvard men’s basketball team will have to survive the jungle.Almost halfway into the conference season, the Crimson has yet to take on its biggest threat—the Tigers. When Harvard welcomes Princeton to Lavietes on Saturday night, the title will be on the line.Two weeks ago, it seemed likely that Princeton would go undefeated against its six other Ancient Eight opponents. After being ranked first in the preseason poll, the Tigers came charging into conference play. Led by senior forward Ian Hummer—second in the league behind Wes Saunders with 15.7 points per game—they picked up decisive home victories over Penn, Cornell, Columbia, and Brown, and the Tigers looked to be the strongest team in the league.But an upset loss at the hands of Yale last weekend changed everything.Now Harvard and Princeton each own one Ivy League loss, and provided that neither team drops another game against its other opponents, the two matchups between the Crimson and the Tigers will determine everything.
Harvard’s only loss came at the hands of Columbia, and while the lack of defense was troubling, it does not meanthat the Crimson is a weaker team. The Lions’ leading scorer in the victory was sophomore guard Steve Frankoski, who put up 27 points—20 in the first half—while shooting 71 percent from the beyond the arc.The performance was impressive, but also a fluke. Fankoski averages a respectable 9.8 points per game and has tallied fewer than 6 points per game during conference play. Playing on the road, Harvard fell at the hands of a momentarily hot shooter.Princeton, on the other hand, was defeated by a team that did nothing extraordinary. The Bulldogs shot over 50 percent from the field in a balanced offensive effort in which their highest scorer, guard Javier Duren, only posted 13 points.The loss at Jadwin—which snapped the Tigers 21-game home win streak—put on display fundamental weaknesses in Princeton’s game. While the Tigers have held their opponents to 39-percent three point shooting, the Bulldogs shot over 58 percent from long range last weekend.Going up against a dominant perimeter team like Harvard—currently leading the league at 41 percent—Princeton will be hard pressed to hold off the likes of Christian Webster, Siyani Chambers, and Laurent Rivard from deep.Although Harvard began the season essentially relying on Saunders and Chambers to put up big points in every game to spell a lack of consistency from the rest of its starters, the team has come a long way since the start of the year.Sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi—who lost his starting spot after a slow first five games—has developed into one of the Crimson’s strongest defensive players. He leads the team in rebounds and blocks with more than one per game.With Mondou-Missi developing as a key defensive stopper, Harvard will be able to make things hard for Hummer. While the team was previously forced to rely on top-scorer Saunders to go up against its opponent’s big man—Allen Crabbe of Cal, for example—the sophomore now has more freedom to focus on putting points on the board.The Crimson may look like a team that lives or dies by its three-point percentage, but the mere threat of its top shooters is enough to create open space in the paint.Even when Harvard’s shots aren’t falling from the behind the arc—as was the case in its overtime game against Dartmouth in which Rivard went 1-7 from deep—its opponents are forced to employ aggressive perimeter defense.Against the Big Green, Harvard took advantage of that opportunity, as sophomore forward Jonah Travis scored 14 points down low, while Chambers and Saunders relied on the dribble to combine for 22 points without hitting a single three.Then there’s the power of Lavietes—where the Crimson will play two games this weekend and close out the season against Columbia and Cornell in March. Harvard has played half of its games on the road so far, and will split the remainder of the season between playing at home and playing away.Princeton has a tougher road ahead with only two more home games and seven to play in hostile territory.With eight games still to play, the Crimson is poised to use this weekend’s matchups against Penn and Princeton as a springboard for its title run—and to show that the Tigers really aren’t as scary as they seem.—Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu.

I have always wanted a  secret admirer. In high school my friend Millie had one. As we were  assembling our woodwind instruments at the start of band class, she told  me that someone had left a single red rose taped to her locker with no  note or expectation behind it. Only much later did we discover that the  rose had come from George, a slender, graceful senior who had been  Millie’s number one match on our Valentine’s Day data match survey.  Though the survey had polled for deodorant preferences and favorite  YouTube sensations, Millie was giddy that she had been matched with such  a sweet senior boy. Being admired, or at the very least celebrated,  meant something.On a  chilly February night of freshman year, I convinced my friend to  accompany me to the mail center after Annenberg brain break. I needed to  pick up a card that Grandma had sent—she sends her valentines two weeks  early lest the trusty postal system encounter a delay. Steeped in  conversation with my friend, I turned the lock on what I thought was my  mailbox, 1416, but was actually its neighbor, 1415. It opened easily. I  guess people forget that a few extra swivels are necessary to fully lock  a mailbox.   Before long,  my friend and I were skipping down the corridor, flinging our hands at  the metallic knobs and twisting open any door that could be unlatched.  After rendering mailbox locks meaningless, we leaned against the back  wall and stared out at the plane of mailboxes, most flat and sealed but  many jutting out into the third dimension with their open  doors—illuminated windows amidst a sleeping skyscraper.  As my friend  and I admired our work, I realized that this would be my first  Valentine’s Day without a boyfriend in three years. This year the  store-bought card from Grandma could be my one, my only, valentine. But  it didn’t have to be this way. I could leave behind a note in one of  these open mailboxes. I could become someone’s secret admirer.   I chose one  of the open mailboxes at random: let’s call it number 1039. “To 1039,” I  scratched with a blunt pencil on a square of lined paper I tore out of  my Expos notebook. Then I composed a poem. The exact verses elude me  now, but the poem was an ode—something about a smile that shines with  the shimmer of 1,000 suns, teeth nested and glowing like newly polished  pearls.  At the end I noted that if the admired wanted to respond,  slipping a note under the stack of IM newsletters sitting by the mail  counter would do the trick. I never expected a note in return.   
The next  time I visited the mail center I checked under the IM newsletters on a  whim and, to my surprise, encountered a response from my admired 1039.  Like me, 1039 wrote in pencil, but my admired’s instrument was of  thinner, more confident lines. 1039 wrote the note on folded printer  paper, one notch up in elegance from my college-ruled first attempt.  This clean white paper signaled to me that the note may have been  composed in the dorm or near a computer lab—it was intentionally and  carefully written, quite unlike the ripped-off notebook jots of my first  correspondence. Reveling in the purity of my skin, the sparkle of my  eyes, 1039’s note had a singsong yet mystical quality. It left no clues  as to the identity of my admired.    Walking  around campus in the following days I daydreamed about my admired,  constantly imagining who this person could be. In Annenberg every person  was a possible admired: the swimmer with strapping shoulders, the  nimble-fingered violinist, the soft, contemplative face behind  Descartes’ Meditations. I came to admire them all. Their gazes were  glitter, their dispositions sacred.   Valentine’s  Day was fast approaching, and I wanted to do something special for my  admired 1039. One Friday night I congregated with some friends in the  Adams Arts Space, a rickety room off Adams courtyard full of old  clothing, forgotten books, and an impressive collection of paints. While  others socialized I devoted myself to a valentine, slicing out glossy  photos of haloed angels from an old medieval art textbook and lining the  prints with a crinkled satin ribbon. Backing the images on red  cardstock, I penned another declaration of admiration to 1039 in silver  Sharpie.   Valentine  complete, I decided that rather than leaving the valentine in mailbox  1039 I would send my admirer on a scavenger hunt. On a yellowed page  from an old German joke book scattered amidst the Adams art debris, I  scrawled a rudimentary map of Annenberg, marking very clearly where 1039  could find the valentine. It would be waiting beneath coordinates  1,1—on the underside of the first table, in the first row and column of  Annenberg Hall. When Valentine’s Day arrived I opened mailbox 1039 from  the outside and stuffed in the map, then hurried off to Annenberg to  tape my haloed angel card beneath the chosen table.   Someone  found the hidden card—I checked underneath table 1,1 in Annenberg a few  days later and it had disappeared. Maybe it was picked up by my admired,  maybe by another. Either way, I never heard back. But I don’t mind.  Getting to love someone, to prioritize another, even in secret, made it  worth it.

Harvard researchers have developed the first quantitative neuromotor assessment device, an advancement which could have repercussions for fields ranging from sports medicine to Parkinson’s disease research.After the first clinical study involving the new technology, researchers said that the results suggest that the device generates accurate quantitative results about neuromotor function, whereby sensory information is translated into body movement.In the study, 150 participants ranging in age from 21 to 95 traced the perimeter of a circle using a stylus on an electronic tablet. Researchers then measured and analyzed a number of factors including the errors that subjects made in tracing the perimeter.As researchers expected, older subjects showed an overall decrease in performance, a result which the study’s authors say demonstrates the efficacy of the device. Medical School professor Lewis A. Lipsitz, who was one of the study’s authors, said that the neuroassesment device provides an “integrated measure” of the multiple systems that interact to control movement but that are difficult to measure individually.The study was a collaboration among researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the Medical School-affiliated teaching hospital Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Hebrew SeniorLife, an elder care center based in Roslindale, Mass. The results of the study were published last week in an edition of the online Journals of Gerontology, Series A.
“A key aspect of physiology is [the question of] what makes systems resilient, robust, and able to withstand stress,” said Ary L. Goldberger, a Medical School professor and one of the study’s authors.Medical School senior staff engineer Leia A. Stirling, the study author who led the project, said that researchers are currently using the device to study concussions. Their study involves running the device before and after an individual has sustained a concussion, she said.Stirling said the device could be significant in the future because anyone—including coaches tending to athletes—can administer it. This usage could augment the current qualitative medical tests administered and interpreted by experts.Researchers said the device may also be useful in providing a new quantitative way to measure rehabilitation.“While experts have a lot of experience, they cannot easily quantify a defect in the control of movement,” Lipsitz said.—Staff writer Alyza J.

Last Wednesday, at a Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris proposed a plan that would completely <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/cue-meeting-reading-period/"">restructure reading period, the prized week before finals most notable for its high number of both paper deadlines and disrobed freshmen. The proposal would eliminate one of these two hallmarks by moving all final project and paper deadlines back to exam period so that they coincide with the week allotted for final exams. Under the proposal, professors would be required to clearly identify the designated due dates at the beginning of the semester, and students would be able to use reading period in the manner that its name suggests.Harris’s idea has obvious pros and cons, and students on campus are likely to have conflicting views on the matter. While some will argue that giving students more time to complete assignments can be nothing but a good thing, others can retort that they will be unable to successfully manage their time with the newfound agglomeration of deadlines.We cannot have any idea which scenario is likely to be true for the most students. And considering that students were not involved in formulating the new proposal, the College likely has a similar paucity of information on the matter.As such, this presents the unique opportunity for campus-wide reflection and discourse. Student opinion should be sought out in designing any new schedule, and students should think about how they value the final weeks of their term and how they envision that period restructuring in the future. We hope that the administration takes into account student input before making any top-down changes. Any alteration of the finals period schedule will have the ostensible purpose of eliminating stress and relieving anxiety in students. This is a noble goal, but students must be consulted in order for it to have a reasonable chance of succeeding.Over 50 years ago, we <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1957/3/21/reading-period-pto-a-person-unfamiliar/"">opined on the utility of reading period. We recognize now, as we recognized then, that reading periods have the dangerous potential to function as “cramming orgies.” The fundamental flaw in the implementation of the period remains “unpleasantry in human nature.” We must combat this “unpleasantry” by cogitating about it, as students, as faculty, and as administrators. We must heed the words inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi: “Know thyself.” The administration can only make a change in good faith once it understands the processes that will positively affect the most students on campus.
The debate over reading period is just beginning, and it poses several questions, both philosophical and logistical. On the more pragmatic end of the spectrum, it is important to examine the role that Harvard faculty will play in any new regime. For the most part, professors here do an excellent job in being communicative and in providing flexibility to students working on important assignments. It would be tragic if the imposition of a new end-of-term regimen in any way hinders this ethic of student assistance. If the goal of a restructured reading period is to give students more time and flexibility in composing final papers and projects, we would hope that professors honor that goal by releasing final assignments well in advance of the new deadlines. We are all ultimately here to learn; any measure to alter the administrative process must keep that in mind. And any effort that increases the facility of receiving a valuable education will be nothing but propitious for the erudition that lies ahead.

Hey there, lovebirds! It’s Valentine’s Day, and you know what that means: Dozens of you will be having happy, romantic evenings around the Square tonight, while the rest of us will be stuck with whatever questionable casserole HUDS feels like serving. But it doesn’t have to be that way! FM is here to find you a restaurant that’s singles friendly. First PrinterThis classy spot is definitely a no-go except for the bar area. You’ll see plenty of young couples who, waiting for their entrées to be cooked up, leaning across elegant wooden tables to stare into each other’s vacant faces, all the while sipping on their $10 cocktails. The place won’t take a reservation for one tonight, so don’t bother showing up without a fun little romance. The bar section gets pleasantly noisy, drowning out what I’m sure are completely inane conversations taking place throughout the restaurant’s candlelit corners. The drinks are also comfortingly strong, so drink away if the sight of their clasped hands starts making you so nauseous you stop wanting the bison burger you ordered. L.A. Burdick ChocolatesAh, Burdick’s. A longtime staple for students’ first dates, the chocolatier is sure to be buzzing with lovey-dovey couples all day. The cold doesn’t help either, since their hot chocolate is some of the best in the Square. Bring an iPod—the wait will be a long one, and unless you have someone to talk to in line, you’re sure to be driven mad by the idea that even the unshaved, food-stained-shirt-wearing, smelly guy behind you could have a date scheduled for tonight at the nearest Chick-fil-A. If there’s only one of something left, be sure to buy it for yourself. We wouldn’t want one of those cute couples to break up arguing over who gets the last one, now, would we?
 Basta PastaA winner! Nobody at Harvard ever leaves the Square, so it’ll be mostly date-free this Valentine’s Day. Finally, you can enjoy your hearty meal without having to endure another clichéd marriage proposal and distracting applause interrupting your meal. Seriously, do those people have any idea how obnoxious it is to have their special moment absorb the attention of everyone in the restaurant, including my waiter’s? He can’t even see me trying to order another bottle of wine for myself.

There was a time when Alzheimer’s was considered a genetic disease, one that mainly affected families with a history of Alzheimer’s and only rarely appeared outside this genetic chain. If someone was diagnosed, his family was forced to accept the unfortunate fate as a happenstance outside of their control, similar to that of unexpected cancers or severe, traumatic accidents. However, like many other diseases rampant in today’s society, Alzheimer’s has recently been linked to the unhealthy American diet and fallen into the obesity bandwagon, labeled <a href=""http://www.nationalreviewofmedicine.com/issue/2005/12_15/2_advances_medicine01_21.html"">type 3 diabetes by Brown University neuropathologist Suzanne De La Monte. Her <a href=""http://research.brown.edu/myresearch/Suzanne_delaMonte"">research indicates the main cause of Alzheimer’s is the brain’s inability to use insulin properly for normal brain activity; hence, the diabetes label. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes share an analogous inability. The negative effect high sugar foods have on our physical existence is well understood, but according to this research, these same foods could even affect our future cognitive functionality.Though the research is clearly compelling, it leaves us with more questions than solutions. Several government policies have already surfaced to mitigate high sugar consumption, only to be immediately criticized with public disapproval. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s highly debated “<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/09/13/nyc-board-of-health-passes-soda-ban/"">soda ban” that mandated restaurants only serve up to a certain size of soft drink was accused of being <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/bloombergs-soda-ban-discriminatory/story?id=18293176"">discriminatory and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/with-passage-of-bloomberg-soda-ban-and-mcdonalds-counting-calories-food-wars-continue/2012/09/13/bcb02844-fdc2-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_blog.html"">proto-Big Brother. Similarly, Michelle Obama’s 2010 federal school lunch initiative barred certain foods or rationed others and forced an <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/snacks-usdas-solution-healthy-school-lunch-protests/story?id=17324285"">850-calorie limit. Like many of its ancestral reforms, there has been more evidence supporting the repeal of these regulations than their continuation.Laws restricting people’s diets are ineffective because they attempt to solve the obesity epidemic with umbrella solutions. Obesity is a highly individualized issue. It isn’t something that can be solved by forcing people to practice self-restraint, because the disease has many contributing <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/genes-and-obesity/"">factors. And because these rules challenge one’s autonomy—a right to choose what to eat—people tend to focus on whether they feel their personal rights are being violated and not on whether their health is actually being improved. The laws may provide a necessarily severe first step toward ending obesity, but they fall short in actually providing a sustainable solution.Consider Michelle Obama’s lunch campaign. One major complaint was that some children were <a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/2/michelle-obamas-school-lunch-program-leaves-childr/"">hungry at school because their lunches did not provide enough fuel for the day. The students were sluggish, affecting overall school performance, and their metabolism slowed, leading to further health complications. Many parents also started packing lunches, sending sugary juices and fatty snacks off with their kids, simply because they did not know the health risks associated with these common foods or because they could not afford the more expensive, healthier options. While in theory the school lunch program seemed like an easy solution to force children to eat healthier, it instead complicated the issue.One way to improve current legislation is to point the finger on who is actually to blame. Bloomberg and Obama punish sources by preventing restaurants and school cafeterias from providing unhealthy foods, but they should focus on people who decide to eat these foods in the first place. Enacting laws that provide more options will encourage people to change their lifestyles and result in life-long dietary changes that could last for generations.
NBC’s Biggest Loser opens its newest season by highlighting the influence adults have on children’s health, featuring children for the first time as “<a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/kids-biggest-loser-exploitation-181138574.html"">contestants” in hopes of inciting viewers to persuade their own children to stay active. Current health legislation and initiatives do not encourage people to take responsibility for their unhealthy decisions and make personal efforts to change their habits. The law should not restrict unhealthy foods but instead make healthy foods more easily accessible, by providing subsidies for healthier food options or implementing taxes on unhealthy foods, for example. With the current restrictions, people are encouraged to overcompensate in other unhealthy areas that are currently not restricted—the natural human reaction to want what they cannot have. This does nothing to help solve our gluttony problem.Research, laws, and TV shows that highlight the dangerous effects of unhealthy diets have all played an important role in ending obesity by increasing awareness of what could easily be an ignorable disease. However, using impersonal laws to restrict the foods available to Americans is ineffective and inefficient: People waste time attempting to protest the mandates instead of thinking of better solutions. There might not be a winning solution to the obesity problem yet, but until a cure surfaces, Americans must be mindful of what they eat and realize that getting healthier is at least partly a personal choice. Legislation must then do its part to provide healthier options to those that might not be able to afford them and provide individual solutions to keep people healthy. Until we choose to simply have our cake and not eat it too, there is little hope that any solution could end the obesity epidemic.Gina Yu ’13, a Crimson editorial writer, is a biomedical engineering concentrator in Dunster House.

I spent the summer before my senior year of high school walking  past the same painting every day. A woman in a white dress sits holding a  fan, ankles crossed primly. The brim of a modish hat obscures her face,  but her dark-eyed profile is reflected in the mirror behind her. That  summer, she hung, gilt framed, in the window of a Manhattan gallery just  down the block from my internship at The Frick Collection. Every time I  rounded the corner of East 70th Street onto Madison, the woman in the  white dress stared obliquely out at me, but I never paused much to look  at her. There was always the M4 bus to catch or friends waiting for me,  and the painting never changed.The last day of my internship, my mom came to the  museum to see my final presentation. After it was over, we walked  together to the bus stop. “Up here on the right is Knoedler’s,” I said.  “Knoedler was the art dealer who—“It was at this point that my mom looked past  Knoedler’s, to the gallery next door, and seized my arm. “Oh my God!  That painting is by your great-great-uncle!” She was pointing to the  woman in white.This idea was too absurd to contemplate. I knew that  my great-great-uncle had been a painter, just like his brother, my  great-grandfather. All of this was the stuff of my childhood bedtime  stories. Molarsky paintings had always lined the walls of our apartment  and filled the cupboards in the study above the space my crib once  occupied. But these paintings were private mementos of our family  history, not public art objects, and so I laughed and told my mother she  must be wrong.But she was right.
A woman  working in the gallery told us that the painting was, indeed, a  Molarsky, and that it could be ours for the price of three years of  college tuition, sans financial aid. We didn’t—couldn’t—buy the  painting, but we stood for a long time staring at it through the window  glass.My great-great-uncle, the painter of the woman in  the white dress, came from Kiev, Ukraine to Philadelphia in 1892—or  1887, depending on which documents you trust. As a young artist studying  in Paris, he would later change his name to Maurice, but he was born  Morris Molarsky, and that was still his name when he arrived in America  as a boy of fourteen. According to family lore, Morris, his parents, and  his older brother—Abe, my great-grandfather—came fleeing the pogroms,  but no one (at least, no one living) is quite sure.Of the two brothers, it is Abe who fascinates me. We  know that in America, Abe studied violin, while his brother studied  painting. When Morris won an art scholarship to Paris and became  Maurice, Abe tagged along. They shared a studio in the Latin Quarter, on  the Rue de Vaugirard, where I imagine they painted all day and all  night, illuminated by flickering lamplight, shivering against the cold,  their hands swaddled in wool gloves, like characters from La Bohème.When the scholarship money was all used up, Abe kept  painting in New Jersey and made a meager living teaching art classes.  He never had any patience for his students. “See color,” he would tell  them again and again, and become infuriated when their work did not  improve. Not even the most dedicated pupil could learn to see color the  way Abe could instinctively. Maurice was the celebrated academician of  the two brothers, and his technical polish earned him a steady stream of  portrait commissions from bourgeois Philadelphians. It was Abe, though,  with his dearth of formal training, who could render with intense  feeling a wooded landscape or scene of harbored boats in a few rapid  movements of the brush.Abe never achieved fame or fortune as an artist, but  he didn’t stopped painting. Maybe he didn’t know how to stop. Painting  was his vocation in the original, weighty, Christian sense of the  word—he was called to pick up the brush as some are called to preach.  His only career advice for his children was, “Take up writer. Take up  musician. Take up hot dog stand—don’t take up painter!”Now, as a sophomore and newly-declared History of  Art and Architecture concentrator, I find myself wondering what it would  be like to “take up painter”—to devote myself to some path  unthinkingly, because something in my very nature compels me to, as Abe  once did with painting. I do love art history, but I chose my  concentration after making pro/con lists and doing online research.  There are internships, graduate degrees, and (hopefully) entry-level  jobs in my future. What would it be like to paint all night long in a  drafty garrett like Abe, less by choice than out of some unavoidable  need?As a child, I used to kneel on the living room sofa  in order to put myself at eye level with the enormous Abe canvas hanging  there. From inches away, the rippling water of a New Jersey creek  dissolved into great, thick gobs of yellow and green paint. When no one  was looking, I would reach up and trace the edges of each brushstroke,  raised a few millimeters off the surface of the canvas. It was a  reverent act of devotion, although one I knew my mother would chide me  for. I felt that with each touch of fingertips to hardened pigment I  could understand my great-grandfather just a little more—feel what he  had felt, do as he had done.Marina Molarsky-Beck ‘15, an FM executive, is a History of Art and  Architecture Concentrator in Eliot House.

Thinking about watching “Love Actually” because it’s Valentine’s Day? Don’t. Here to save you from Hugh Grant’s estrogen-churning narration and a blond Severus Snape, FM brings you prime celluloid flicks for every Valentine’s Day occasion. For one softhearted cinephile (or two):To apologize for forgetting to make Valentine’s Day plans…Try “Inferno,” a 3-D film from 1953 in which a scheming wife conspires with her lover to leave her husband to die in the desert. Once your valentine sees that kind of bat-shit insanity, you’ll seem more helpless than negligent.To add some sexual oomph to your post-Valentine’s date activities…The key here is subtlety. Consider “Gilda,” the 1946 noir classic starring Rita Hayworth as the drippy, doe-eyed femme fatale. Her coquettish performance of the song “Put the Blame on Mame” will have your valentine pining over pillow talk for a good striptease. Other good alternatives: “Eyes Wide Shut” (1999), “Breaking the Waves” (1996), and porn.
To seduce that ‘friend valentine’ you’ve actually been harboring romantic feelings for…Express yourself with less, that is, without words. Check out “City Lights” (1931), where Charlie Chaplin’s splayfooted, potty love-struck, and Dickensesque Little Tramp falls in love with a poor blind girl, but is too ashamed to reveal his loser self to her. If you don’t get kissed in the closing scene, your valentine lacks all emotion and is unfit for your affection.To forget about the fact that you just got dumped a week before Valentine’s Day…You’ll jump for “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (2004) or “Casablanca” (1942) because the subject matter so seemingly foots the bill. In the end, however, they’ll just leave you wallowing in the bitter memories of your broken relationship. Instead, go for “High Fidelity” (2000). There’s no telling how many miserable romantics John Cusack has charmed out of breakup depression from behind the film’s precarious fourth wall. For a different take, try “Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2” (1986).To make you believe in true love…“Howl’s Moving Castle” (2004)—Hayao Miyazaki’s adroitly and sensitively imagined, animated love story puts every Disney sap-fest to shame. An inversion of “Beauty and the Beast,” the film tells the story of a young woman who is turned into an old witch and falls in love with a miscreant wizard who stomps the land in a massive gear-girdling contraption of a castle. Sounds weird? Yes, but that’s what makes it so convincing. See also: “Wayne’s World” (1992) and “Wayne’s World 2” (1993).To watch by yourself because you have no valentine…“Labyrinth” (1986)—See David Bowie as Jareth, Goblin King of the Labyrinth. Trust us on this one.

A new study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health suggests that vitamin intake may play a significant role in cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes, a disease commonly associated with genetic factors.The study, which will be published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that young adults who maintain sufficient levels of Vitamin D can reduce their risk of adult-onset type 1 diabetes by 50 to 60 percent.Although most previous type 1 diabetes studies have investigated childhood onset, senior author and School of Public Health professor Alberto Ascherio said that patients diagnosed later in life are more likely to have been affected by environmental factors.The researchers analyzed blood samples of active military members taken from the Department of Defense Serum Repository, comparing diabetes patients’ blood samples taken prior to disease onset with samples taken from a control group.Although the study found that the risk of adult-onset type 1 diabetes may be significantly reduced if vitamin D levels are at least 75 nanomoles per liter, lead author and School of Public Health research associate Kassandra Munger said the results are only conclusive for non-Hispanic white males.
“We didn’t see an association in non-Hispanic Blacks or Hispanics, possibly due to the smaller sample size,” Munger said. “We also can’t say for sure that the same results would be seen in women.”The research group decided to study the effects of Vitamin D on type 1 diabetes after previously finding a strong association between Vitamin D levels and multiple sclerosis.Bruce W. Hollis, professor of pediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina, said that the consistent results of both studies provides strong evidence that adequate Vitamin D levels can contribute to disease prevention.“Multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes are both autoimmune disorders, and the studies basically showed the same thing,” said Hollis. “The papers have shown that you need to take three to four thousand units per day to attain appropriate blood levels to prevent diseases.”Although additional studies are necessary before any formal recommendations for Vitamin D supplementation are made, researchers stressed the importance of achieving high Vitamin D levels.In addition to food sources, Hollis said that one of the easiest ways to achieve these Vitamin D levels is to get sun exposure. Spending 20 minutes outside during peak sun hours releases about 20,000 units of Vitamin D into the bloodstream within 24 hours, he said.The researchers hope to expand their studies in the future.“I hope to study several hundred cases, study a larger sample size that includes women, and look at finer points of association,” Munger said.—Staff writer Michelle S. Lee can be reached at mlee03@college.harvard.edu.

I never seriously considered what the word “hero” meant until this fall. It was a breezy, cool evening just outside Providence, and I had stopped by a charity function to meet up with a friend who was catering the event. The sun was setting, and in keeping with local tradition, all guests were to stand at attention while a cannon was fired and the American flag was lowered.Usually, residents or employees carry out this task. But tonight, these duties fell to four seniors from the United States Naval Academy. Shortly before the last rays of sunlight disappeared over the horizon, one of the event’s organizers announced the entrance of these “young heroes,” as he called them. On cue, all four trotted out in mess dress, and as they walked by the crowd, one dinner guest stood up and started clapping. A few more followed suit, and soon everyone was on their feet, whether or not they truly believed the accomplishments of these cadets merited applause.This moment affected many attendees on a deeply emotional level—a few, overcome by pride and patriotism, were on the verge of tears. But for me, and a silent minority of the crowd, the whole ceremony seemed a bit ridiculous.As far as I could tell, these students had so far succeeded only at receiving an excellent education. I knew a couple of them personally. Both were good guys, but like anyone they had their flaws. The only thing that made them exceptional was that they were preparing to fight in war, and the mere fact that they were warriors—or at least becoming warriors—was apparently enough to make them “heroes” worthy of universal reverence.I will concede that when students enroll in a service academy, or when non-academic recruits enlist for that matter, many do so because they are genuinely interested in offering their minds and their bodies to a humane and selfless cause. To thousands of enlistees, and to much of the civilian public, there is no better way to do this than to join the military. The resolve and moral purpose of those that fight out of patriotic conviction is admirable. But let’s not romanticize the moral situation of the soldier; once he puts on the uniform, he divests himself of his ability to act according to his reason and conscience. True, he can choose to spare a life or sacrifice his own. These decisions may still be his. But, for good reason, he cannot question his authorities, nor can he choose which battles to fight or make any decisions of that sort. In many ways, he becomes a pawn, serving the whims of his martial superiors and political leaders. Should his conscience contradict his mission at any point, he is required to ignore this contradiction, lest he be labeled a mutineer or a coward.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with pledging oneself unconditionally to a cause so long as the cause is unconditionally correct. Many hawkish Americans would claim that the actions of our armed forces in the modern era, with only trivial exceptions, have been virtuous—hence the heightened level of hero worship within the neoconservative bloc.I wish I could be so confident. In Iraq, for instance, I’m not sure the deposition of Hussein was worth the death of 100,000 civilians, especially when he was no longer capable of attacking the Kurds to the north or the Shiites to the south. To cherry-pick a few conflicts from the past several decades, our designs in Vietnam and Guatemala hardly seem heroic in retrospect.I’m sure a few members of the crowd were equally unsure of the humanitarianism of our foreign engagements, but they were clapping nevertheless. “Intentions matter!” they may say. This argument—that the act of fighting, even in an unjust war, is laudable so long as a soldier is well intentioned—has become commonplace. But its popularity doesn’t make it valid. When there is nothing noble about the ends of fighting, we shouldn’t seek comfort in the dated belief that the act of fighting is noble in and of itself. Yet that’s the argument that we advance every time we clap for a soldier merely for having agreed to take up arms.Readers may ask: why bother with this whole analysis? Why not let soldiers and their families take comfort in the knowledge that they are regarded as heroes in American society?One could answer this question in many ways, but the most important reason is that our deification of soldiers makes war more palatable. When we say to ourselves that soldiers do not die in vain, that it is always noble to fight for one’s country, we make the tragedy of wars, past and present, easier to digest. As historian and ex-U.S. Air Force lieutenant William Astore points out in the Los Angeles Times, the overuse of heroic rhetoric among continental powers significantly prolonged World War I, as the act of fighting seemed worthwhile even when the desired end had slipped out of reach.As I watched that crowd outside Providence cheer and cry for those supposed “heroes” simply because they had agreed to fight, I couldn’t help but fear that our modern fetishizing of the military has a similar effect.J. Gram Slattery ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Kirkland House.

Cambridge frozen yogurt lovers can rejoice at the impending arrival of Yogurtland, a self-service yogurt store featuring 16 flavors and more than 40 toppings, to Harvard Square in mid-April. The yogurt purveyor will be housed at the former location of Faron Salon at 57 JFK St.According to Larry Sidoti, vice president of development, the store plans to have a grand opening in late April.Though Yogurtland has opened locations in 21 states since its 2006 launch, the California-based company is just beginning to spread to the East Coast. Huntley Castner, executive vice president of Yogurtland franchising, said the company is focusing its efforts on Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.“We looked at all three of those cities and decided what would be the absolute best places that we could be in those cities. Not a surprise, Harvard Square was one of those locations,” Castner said.Unlike some of the other Yogurtland stores, which operate as independent franchises, the new Cambridge location will be owned directly by the Yogurtland corporation.
“We believe so much in the Harvard Square location that we wanted to own the store ourselves, and we are really excited about it,” Castner said.The store will be open from 11 a.m. to midnight every day and will include  about 16 to 20 indoor seats and limited outdoor seating.Vanessa C. Rodriguez ’16, a Florida native familiar with the Yogurtland brand, expressed excitement at the announced arrival.“From what I’ve experienced, compared to other yogurt places, it’s a lot cheaper,” Rodriguez said. “They have a lot of flavors that are constantly changing, and it’s based off the way people rank them and what sells out the most, so they really care about the customers.”Castner said that he expects that the continuous introduction of new flavors will attract many in the Harvard Square community.According to Castner, a “Willy Wonka type” innovation team works year-round inventing flavors and “spending months and months of passion and efforts trying to get it right.”Sidoti added that Yogurtland’s size—over 200 stores—allows it to offer high quality yogurt at a lower price per ounce than at most other stores.“I’ve visited most of our competitors, and there’s a real difference,” he said. “[Students] are in for a real treat.”While the new Yogurtland will open near fellow frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry, Castner said that the distinct experiences offered by the two stores—Yogurtland is self-serve and Pinkberry is full-service—will enable the stores to “live side by side.”“In the end, the customer decides whether they love us,” Castner said.“We’re going to do everything we can to help you guys love us.”—Staff writer Nikki D. Erlick can be reached at nikkierlick@college.harvard.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 14, 2013An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the street address of the Yogurtland store slated to open in Harvard Square. In fact, the store will be located at 57 JFK St., not 24 JFK St.

This weekend’s homestand will pit Harvard against two conference foes. First up will be a Friday night showdown against Penn. On Saturday, Harvard will take on arguably its biggest threat in the Ancient Eight, its rival Princeton. The Crimson’s basketball beat writers answer five questions about this weekend’s matchups.
1) Is Penn a sleeper threat?
DF: Although it's very hard to take a 5-17 team seriously as a 'sleeper' threat, the Crimson need to be prepared for a dogfight on Friday. A classic trap game after a tough loss and before possibly Harvard's biggest game of the season against Princeton on Saturday, the Quakers can provide trouble for the Crimson. Penn recently defeated Brown by 23 at home, the same team the Crimson needed double overtime to beat. The Quakers are not a particularly good three-point shooting team by Ivy League standards (34% as a team) but it is deep, with 11 players averaging over 13 minutes a game. Harvard is typically solid at Lavietes but will need to come out strong against a Penn opponent that’s hot off its best win of the year.<a name=""jump"">
2) What are the keys to success against Princeton?
JSG: Limiting the Tigers to one shot.
Princeton averages over 46 percent from the field, second to only Harvard in the Ivy League. But turnover statistics lie in the Tigers’ favor, with the Crimson averaging two more mistakes per contest than its New Jersey counterparts. As Princeton does not cough up the ball on the regular and shoots well from the field, Harvard will need to limit its opponents chances to score by minimizing Tiger offensive rebound opportunities.
Pressure Hummer on both ends.
Princeton’s leading man, Ian Hummer, averages almost twice as many turnovers on the road as he does at Jadwin Gymnasium. Increasing the defensive pressure on the forward, especially when he has the ball, will likely lead to more of these away-game fumbles, and, as a result, transition points for Harvard. On the other end, driving to the basket both more and in a more aggressive fashion will place Hummer in a position where he may need to foul to stop an easy score. Right, all that is obvious, but what’s in it for Harvard? In the six games thus far this season that Hummer has accumulated more than four fouls, the Tigers have lost four—including one to a Yale squad that is considered much inferior. By increasing the offensive drives, Harvard will create a catch-22 for Princeton: would it rather give up easy lay-ups or risk sending its star player to the sidelines in foul trouble?
3) What can Harvard do to contain Ian Hummer?
ARM: This was a problem Coach Amaker addressed in his weekly media session on Wednesday. At 6’7,” Hummer is of comparable size to the biggest guys on Harvard’s roster. But his speed and ability to hit jump shots makes him a near-impossible for the Crimson’s interior defenders, like Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi, who will be needed in the paint to combat the rest of Princeton’s sizable front line. Wesley Saunders and Laurent Rivard, both 6’5,” are other possible candidates to check Hummer, though they’ll be hard-pressed to counter his raw strength in the post. Amaker said that defending Hummer wouldn’t come down to the efforts of one player, but would require total team defense, with everyone chipping in and being aware of him at all times. How they defend Hummer might also depend on the results of Friday’s game against Penn; perhaps the fresher bodies with more energy to expend will take the bulk of the assignment.
4) Who will come up big for Harvard this weekend?
CEC: It’s more of a question of who needs to come up big, rather than who definitely will.
Although Crimson coach Tommy Amaker made it clear at this week’s press conference that the Penn game is a point of focus for his team, there is no doubt that the biggest Ivy League matchup of the weekend is Harvard v. Princeton—a contest that pits the conference’s top two teams against each other for the first time this season. And given the significance of that matchup, the Crimson needs to step up its interior defense against the Tigers.
I’m sure, by now, you’re heard of this guy Ian Hummer—the Princeton forward who, along with Crimson sophomore Wesley Saunders, is a frontrunner from Ancient Eight Player of the Year honors. Hummer averages 15.7 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game. And his presence inside, coupled with the fact that the entire Tigers’ lineup stands at least 6’5” (for comparison, the 6’6” Jonah Travis is Harvard’s biggest starter), means a tall task for the Crimson squad.
For Harvard to come out on top Saturday night, it’s going to need a huge game from the sophomore trio of Jonah Travis, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Kenyatta Smith down low.
5) Is this weekend make-or-break for Harvard?
MK: Yes and no. Harvard can drop a contest this weekend and still control its destiny. That being said, if the Crimson falls to Princeton, Harvard will likely need to top the Tigers on the road—a feat it hasn’t accomplished since 1989.

<span style=""white-space: pre;""> As snow began to fall last Friday, Harvard graduate students, humanities professors, and music experts gathered at the Barker Center for a conference entitled “Africa Remix: Producing and Presenting African Musics Abroad.”  Keynote speaker Francis Falceto, music curator, and producer of the acclaimed 27-disc “Éthiopiques” CD series, spoke about his effort to bring late-20th century Ethiopian music to the Western world.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> The conference, which was a collaboration between the department of Music, the Provostial Fund for the Arts and Humanities, the department of African and African American Studies, the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, the Committee on African Studies, and the Office for the Arts at Harvard, raised a multifaceted conversation about the music of Africa.The defining element of the conference was a conversation about recent developments in the field of African music.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> To that end, presenters incorporated music excerpts of globally prominent African artists into their presentations. Each attendee was also given CDs of African music. These included a sampler of songs from Cumbancha, an independent record label specializing in world music, and “Jumbie in the Jukebox,” the second album by Kobo Town, a calypso artist whose music incorporates reggae, poetry, and lyrics about current events.Falceto kicked off the conversation with a discussion of the common misconceptions about music and globalization.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Falceto explained that the audience for African music outside of Africa has grown over his more than 30 years as a producer of Ethiopian music. “[However, African music is] now not as groovy as it was half a century ago,” he said, referring to the changing assortment of instruments used to make the music. According to Falceto, in Ethiopia, technological innovations such as the electronic keyboards that were introduced around 1974 during the Ethiopian Civil War had a significant effect on Ethiopian music. African music is now enjoyed by an audience that comes from beyond the African continent, and Falceto says that the incorporation of new instruments is in part responsible for the resonance it has reached outside Africa.<span style=""white-space: pre;"">  Falceto and the other presenters also discussed the incorporation of Western influences into contemporary African music. Sarah Hankins, a Ph.D. candidate in ethnomusicology,  explained her research on the presence of Ethiopians in Tel Aviv to address questions of identity in remixed African music. In between clips of music from artists like Groove Ambassadors, a band that plays African music in 10 different languages, and Zvuloon Dub System, an Israeli dub band, Hankins shared how the merging of cultures and the new identity of Ethiopian transmigrants and settlers in Tel Aviv has influenced the emergence of African remixed music in Israel.Remixed African music not only strengthens the identities of Africans living abroad, but also serves as a unifying force within Africa, Hankins said.
<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Harvard social anthropology Ph.D. candidate Sharon F.  Kivenko  discussed the role of Malian music in political activism. Efforts to establish post-colonial nationalism in the region were stifled by the fall of the Malian government in March 2012, she explained. As creativity became threatened by the religious zeal and war of this time of conflict, Malian artists like Amkoullel have been using music to voice criticism of governmental corruption and to mobilize the Malian people to repair their country. Kivenko shared a clip of “La Paix Au Mali,” a song by Oumou Sangaré calling for peace in Mali.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> “Through this song, this woman, who Forbes has deemed the ninth most powerful African celebrity, was not only looking to reach her Malian compatriots or West African neighbors. She is also intending for this song to serve as plea to her international audience,” Kivenko said.  When the conversation was then opened to the audience, an attendee asked whether the influx of foreign influences into African music is a positive change. The attendees who commented agreed that borrowing between cultures has allowed for African music to be shared across continental borders. However, a division emerged concerning whether collaboration was synonymous with appropriation.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Despite this rosy representation of musical harmony, the blending of musical styles is also affected by a diversity of sociopolitical factors. “It’s not that you can’t cross those [musical] boundaries,” said Ingrid T. Monson, a professor of African-American music. “It’s not that you can’t be an honorable mediator. But you better think about the politics and economics and the history of color.”A concert scheduled for the evening of the conference was cancelled due to weather conditions as a result of a historic blizzard that hit New England last Friday. Yet even in less than optimal conditions, the conference was able to foster interdisciplinary discussion about the evolution of African music in the international sphere.—Staff writer Nzuekoh N.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.February 14, 1919: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1919/2/14/down-to-earth-pin-the-february/"">Down To Earth.In the February issue of the ""Bookman"" is published an article entitled ""Detestable Words."" This gives a few examples of words which the editor despises. According to the ""Bookman,"" ""sense"" appears as a verb in every form from the ""father sensed his son's abstraction"" to the ""peeling infant sensed the coming of the succulent milk-bottle."" ""Poignant"" is on the blacklist because of its downright stupidity, ""stipend"" because of its oily politician sound. ""Remuneration"" is a foolishly long latinized word, and ""dainty"" and ""refined"" are classed as belonging to the ""chewing gum"" variety.<!--more-->To this admirable list perhaps we can add a few others which it has been our own misfortune to observe. On one tragic occasion, we accepted an editorial which mentioned something as one of the most ""enjoyable"" features of college life. Another time we solemnly declared that the University ""rejoices in the fact,"" etc. We defy the ability of anyone to picture in his mind the University rejoicing. Once again, read of a man over-come by a ""virulent obsession""--whatever that may mean.

The main stage at the American Repertory Theater was off balance when lights came up on “The Glass Menagerie.” The right side was set with spare trappings of faded middle class comforts—a sofa upholstered in dated red fabric, a living room table with straight-backed chairs, a folding paper screen, and a phonograph. The left side was dominated by a dizzying series of fire escapes, stumbling and zigzagging upwards, half-illuminated by blue light. Eight stories were visible, shrinking as they approached the ceiling of the theater. The sense that the fire escapes carried on into the cosmos was difficult to escape, especially as Tom Wingfield, the narrator and uneasy protagonist of Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie,” took to the stage in his opening monologue and—twirling for a moment with his back to the audience, arms raised upwards at the infinite fire escapes—declared it to be “a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from.” Director John Tiffany found a balance between a cut-and-dry interpretation of “The Glass Menagerie”—now playing at the ART until March 17—and his own bent towards shock and awe. In doing so he gracefully translated Williams’s classic work onto the modern stage. This smack of the surreal Bob Crowley's set design found its match in the direction as Tom (Zachary Quinto) introduces his sister Laura (Celia Keenan-Bolger). Tom reaches into the back of the sofa, pulling thin white arms out from between the cushions, followed by a silent Laura. Laura’s appearance from within the couch cushions was breathtaking, and as off-kilter as the stage. This intriguing moment was in keeping with the script—for Tom, Laura is relegated to memory—as her character is so ingrained in the apartment that it makes perfect sense for her to materialize from the furniture like a summoned ghost. After the initial theatrics, however, Tiffany decides not to play up moments of shock, instead choosing to play a longer, subtler game which perfectly complements Williams's tense and slow-moving script. Quinto, of the 2009 film “Star Trek” and the television show “Heroes,"" plays Tom as a fascinating mix of petulant and knowing—caught between an irresistible desire to escape and an instinctual drive to be with his family that, for most of the play, kept him at his harping mother’s side. Quinto often translates these conflicting impulses kinetically; he walks either with intense energy or drags his feet with marked inefficiency, his shoulders bunched around his neck in a motion of aggressive self-concealment. Many times he seems to be on the verge of physically lashing out, even during the rare moments he had to himself on the stage. 
Against his foil of static aggression, Quinto’s counterparts, Cherry Jones (who plays Amanda Wingfield) and Keenan-Bolger, both succeed in rendering their characters with subtlety and emotional honesty. The fourth and last member of the cast, Brian J. Smith (who plays Gentleman Caller, Laura’s long-awaited suitor) is less successful—he was seemingly unsure of how earnestly to play his part and ultimately settled into a wholesome, jocular interpretation that left him little room to explore the complexities of Williams's characterization. Keenan-Bolger is stiff-legged and shell-shocked—every motion seems to have been wrenched painfully out of her. She delivers her lines with a wide-eyed openness somehow absent of innocence and presents Laura as a character too damaged by shyness and her sheltered lifestyle to seem pure. Cherry Jones, a Tony Award-winning actress and a founding member of the ART, is stunning in the role of Amanda Wingfield. When speaking with her children, Amanda relies on a mix of maternal wheedling and brute force to have her way. There is a raw edge of desperation that cuts beneath her words—a kind of deep need that manifests in unrelenting action and vivacity. As she plays up her aging Southern belle mannerisms for laughs or cleverly snipes with Tom, Jones employs a stream of constant energy to act as insulation for Amanda’s complex psychology. In the few moments when Amanda is not nagging her children and instead turns her attention to her magazine customers, Jones reveals the true force of her acting abilities—she captures the contradictions and vulnerabilities that mark Williams’s depiction of Amanda Wingfield. In two separate scenes, Amanda cajoles her customers, delivering the righteous, overly sympathetic line, “You’re a Christian martyr, that’s what you are. A Christian martyr,"" waiting for the women to agree—to fall in line underneath her heavy-handed manipulation. But when she fails at this, Jones’ acting abilities are most finely-tuned—she quickly flicks discouragement off her face, carefully replacing the set look that she relies upon to carry her through her life, which, as she says towards the end of the play, “has a way of turning out so badly.” On the whole, Tiffany’s “Glass Menagerie” is marked by dabs of the experimental, but, in the end, is a faithful and classic production of Williams’s piece. The strength of the cast, especially the phenomenal Jones, undoubtedly carries the show, while the innovative set design and occasional touches of the absurd add a modern flavor that illuminates the stranger facets of Williams’s seminal work.  —Sorrel L.

This week, Harvard Square’s historic Brattle Theater continued its longstanding Valentine’s Day tradition of screening the classic American film “Casablanca.” Last night, couples of all ages packed the auditorium to immerse themselves in the timeless tale of love and war.But others who came were a little more cynical about the film, which tells the story of Rick Blaine, an American expatriate in World War II Morocco.“I am spending my Valentine’s Day at Rick’s American because nothing says romance like Nazis, alcoholism, and anti-fascist propaganda,” said Andrew J. Boyd ’14, referring to the nightclub and gambling den owned by Blaine.“‘Casablanca’ has a very strong connection with the Brattle,” said Ned R. Hinkle, who has been the theater’s creative director since 2001—the same year that the annual Valentine’s Day tradition began.For Hinkle, “Casablanca” is a personal favorite.
“It’s a little cynical and has some great humor to it, but it’s also very romantic,” Hinkle said. “It doesn’t end traditionally, which is also one of the other things that makes it a classic.”The Brattle Theater, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year, has been screening the film since its initial release in 1942. And for a short time in the ’60s, “Casablanca” at the Brattle became a local cult phenomenon.“It was a huge thing for Harvard undergraduates to come and watch ‘Casablanca,’” Hinkle said. “They would come in costume and say the lines along with the characters, kind of like the original ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show.’”Last year, the Brattle Theater was unable to hold the screenings due to licensing issues; for the film’s 70th anniversary, Warner Bros. launched a celebratory re-release of the film in theaters across the nation.Although the Brattle Theater’s tradition resumed this year, one defining landmark has disappeared.The Casablanca Restaurant, which opened next to the theater in 1955, closed at the end of last year and will soon be succeeded by a new restaurant of a different name.“We certainly made use of it frequently, both for taking a break from being here or taking guests that come to the theater to dinner,” Hinkle said.“But it seems like the new owners are interested in the history of the building and of Harvard Square, so I think it will fit in.”

It was the night before the CS50 final project was due, and Nikhil L. Benesch ’16 was in high demand. In his first semester at Harvard, Benesch had already skipped CS50, the intro-level computer science class, and advanced to more challenging material. His freshmen friends had—predictably—come begging for help. The mood was buoyant as the adrenaline-addled group coded into the final hours before their deadline.“Oh my god, this is going to make us rich,” Benesch, a Crimson Tech Associate, remembers kidding. This was part grandiloquent team-building, part jab at his buddies for finishing so shoddily and so close to the deadline.They’d gotten the joke. “Guys, this is it,” someone had retorted. “We should drop out of Harvard for this.”It was one of those jokes that is only funny because everyone knows there’s some truth beneath the absurdity. Describing the scene, Benesch breaks into a laugh and then stops, suddenly serious. “But it’s never been quite a joke for me,” he says.Benesch is hardly alone.
Maybe it’s a fluke, or maybe it’s some secret entrepreneurial ingredient, but Harvard has a knack for churning out dropouts armed with the seeds of the Next Big Idea. First there was Bill Gates, slated to graduate in 1977, who left Harvard to found Microsoft and reinvent the cyber world. Then came Mark Zuckerberg, who dropped out in 2004 to found Facebook, reinventing computer culture all over again.The Computer Science faculty doesn’t take that legacy lightly. Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science Harry R. Lewis ’68, who has been at Harvard since 1964, first as an undergrad, then as a grad student, and finally as a professor, has taught Gates, Zuckerberg, and several more recent entrepreneurial dropouts.“I always encourage students who have a burr under their saddle to take time off and deal with it,” he writes in an email. “They can come back to school any time, but they will have a lifetime to regret not seizing an opportunity that presented itself.”In Lewis’s experience, most undergrads who drop out return to Harvard. The University makes it simple to return after taking time off, Lewis explains: Harvard allows students to take semesters off without any effect on their financial aid packages.“It virtually never happens that people fail and never return,” he writes. “And even people who succeed tend to return.”That’s what Meir Lakhovsky did. An Advanced Standing degree candidate in the Computer Science Department, Lakhovsky stayed at Harvard for five semesters, until he left in 2010.“I loved the school!” Lakhovsky says. “I never thought I’d leave.” But during his junior year, Lakhovsky began working on PushPage, a social media tool that allows users to create and share question and answer sessions. His 80-hour-per-week commitment to the startup proved incompatible with a full course load. “My friends thought I should stay in school and wondered why I couldn’t work on my business later,” Lakhovsky says. “But with startups, timing is everything.”A programmer (a.k.a. efficiency guru), Lakhovsky was frustrated by the bureaucracy that he says slows down Harvard life. But leaving Harvard required only one signature on one form. “Taking time off was the easiest thing I did at Harvard!” he quips.This fall, Lakhovsky took three classes at Harvard—enough to earn his degree. He says he has no regrets about the decision to leave when he did.Unlike Lakhovsky, Daniel E. Windham ’15 came to Harvard intending to drop out. The biographical blurb on Windham’s Twitter account reads, “Officially I’m #cs #neuro @harvard, but will probably have left to start a company before I make it to junior year.”

University President Drew G. Faust warned that cuts to federal research funding would endanger innovation, the economy, and “intellectual life” in the United States in a speech to the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.AAAS, which publishes the journal “Science,” holds a yearly conference to bring together scientists, engineers, educators, and policymakers from around the world. Faust, who was chosen this year as one of the co-chairs for the meeting, kicked off the conference last night with a six-minute address at the Hynes Convention Center.In welcoming the conference to Boston, Faust stressed the organization’s role in deepening human understanding and advancing the length and quality of life. She also spent a large portion of her remarks arguing for the prevention of sequestration—deep spending cuts in the federal budget scheduled to go into effect on March 1 if Congress does not agree on an alternative plan. Should lawmakers fail to arrive at a compromise, universities like Harvard—which received approximately $656 million in federal sponsorship last fiscal year—will face <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/3/sequestration-fiscal-deal-spending/"">a severe decline in external research funding.“Now more than ever, science must vigorously make its case,” Faust said in her speech. “It would be worse than a tragedy to waste this moment full of promise, to leave answerable questions unanswered.”Faust also argued that besides being a “major glory of the nation’s intellectual life,” science and innovation are also important drivers of the economy.
“At this critical moment, with scientific opportunities unbounded and a golden future ahead, we must raise our voices,” Faust said. “The American Association for the Advancement of Science must work to prevent the American Congress from becoming an American Association for the Retreat of Science. We owe this to the future.”In an interview with The Crimson last week, Faust explained that Harvard is planning for sequestration in the short term, along with longer-term federal funding cuts that may happen regardless of Congressional action.“There is general agreement that whatever happens with sequestration, the profile for research funding from the federal government is going to be a different one going forward,” she said. “We take that as a given.”In the long term, Faust said, some of the University’s schools might have to reconfigure their finances to adapt to decreased external funding. The School of Public Health, for example, used sponsored support for 73 percent of its operating revenue last fiscal year, according to the <a href=""http://vpf-web.harvard.edu/annualfinancial/pdfs/2012fullreport.pdf"">University’s annual financial report.Along with Harvard’s lobbyists, Faust said that she has spent parts of the past year and a half in Washington talking to policymakers “trying to make the case why research is so important to the American future, to building human capital, to our security as a nation.”—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.

When avid followers of sports scandals were preoccupied learning the bizarre details of Manti Te’o’s non-existent love life, Lance E. Armstrong, the former holder of seven Tour de France victories, finally sat down and came out as one of the country’s most loathsome liars and one of its most arrogant cheats. The reaction to his two-part interview with Oprah Winfrey was a mixture of reprobation and ennui, tinged with the cynical realization that Armstrong’s motive for his remorseless confession was to get back in good standing with irascible bureaucrats in the cycling firmament.A pointed few in the media have defended Armstrong on the basis of his <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2013/01/what-lance-armstrong-did.html"">assertion that “if they gave Tour de France trophies to people who were drug-free, they would have to find their winners in grade school.” While I am sympathetic to that point, this is not meant to be an apologia for Armstrong. It is fair to be annoyed and angered at the duplicity of Armstrong. Yet, American citizens should be more disturbed at the actions of his primary foe in this saga, the United States Anti-Doping and, by extension, the United States government.Wherever Armstrong may currently stand in the court of public opinion, the main point is that he broke the rules. As a result, the International Cyclists Union should be able to do whatever it wants to him, his United States Postal Service team, and every other crook it catches on a street bike. Being the world governing body for a sport comes with the privilege of getting to make the rules and mete out commensurate punishment. Bud Selig has the right to crack down on performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball, and Roger S. Goodell can hand out fines to keep players from making career-ending tackles in the National Football League. Similarly, the UCI should be able to determine the appropriate amount of testosterone and red blood cells a Tour de France participant can have in his body.Yet, in the case of doping, the UCI, which is based in Switzerland, does not have full control over its sport. Rather, it has been forced to accept the investigatory findings of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, a non-governmental organization primarily <a href=""http://www.usada.org/uploads/2011annualreport.pdf"">funded with U.S. taxpayer money. While many Americans spent last month wondering why they were supposed to care that Armstrong admitted what was already widely known, few realized that they themselves were the ones probing his lifestyle choices in the first place.The three-year molestation of Armstrong by American kibitzers is not yet complete. The United States Justice Department is now poised to join a whistleblower lawsuit filed by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis. The suit accuses Armstrong of defrauding the government under the False Claims Act, as his team violated the terms of its United States Postal Service sponsorship. If Landis were to win the case, the government would receive the majority of the $60 million award, three times the amount it paid to support the team. The post office is currently <a href=""http://about.usps.com/news/speeches/2013/pr13_pmg0103.htm"">losing $25 million a day, so a victory in court might prolong its lifespan for a couple hours.
Missing from this scenario is the UCI, which had previously tried to stop the USADA from interloping in its affairs. USADA CEO Travis Tygart has pilloried the organization in charge of cycling, <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/usada-chief-uci-obstructed-lance-armstrong-probe"">saying he “was shocked that [sporting] federations here still handle doping cases.” That statement is rather nutty; it makes perfect sense that a sporting federation handles its own affairs. It makes considerably less sense that an unelected body of government-supported pencil pushers dictates how a sport chooses to conduct itself in matters of athletics.Opponents of government intervention in sporting events can easily attest that doping is a victimless crime. Yet, such an assertion’s validity rests on the fictional notion that doping is a crime at all. The only “laws” against performance-enhancing drugs come from questionable treaties written by globetrotting jock sniffers who lack athletic skill but still want to feel sportive. While everyone should be allowed to chase his or her career dream, it is rather disappointing that governments around the world spend public funds on such priggishness.Globalization has increased the realms in which governments interact. As such, countries naturally have to reach compromises beyond affairs such as migration and commerce. However, when it comes to sports, which lack any relationship to a country’s national security, it is best for governments to stay out. Governments don’t punish students when they are caught cheating or journalists when they are caught plagiarizing. If cycling wants to punish Lance Armstrong, so be it. Meanwhile, let the government get back to running the country.John F. M. Kocsis ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, is a government concentrator in Eliot House. His column appears on alternate Fridays.

Drone strikes have received attention from nearly every academic association and think tank, including the <a href=""http://www.asil.org/files/2010/insights/insights_101112.pdf"">American Society of International Law, the <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736"">Council on Foreign Relations, and the <a href=""https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/3ddcaca6-8e73-42b6-ad0f-c732f17e79df/drones-YBIHL.aspx"">Naval War College. And, for better or worse, they have become a permanent feature of American foreign policy debates, from journalists and policymakers to human rights groups and non-governmental organizations.Of course, these discussions are vital and necessary. The ideals of American democracy and the unprecedented questions of their use require extensive discussions on drone strikes. Yet, no one has discussed drone strikes in relation to another critical development of U.S. national security policy, the eroding distinction between war and peace, a topic recently highlighted in the Washington Post’s series on <a href=""http://opiniojuris.org/2012/10/27/the-washington-posts-three-article-series-on-the-permanent-war/"">the Permanent War.Recent discussions have connected the topics only in terms of current changes in national security policy. An article on the forever war may use a picture of a drone strike or it may use the expansion of drone bases as an example of the ways in which counterterrorism operations have expanded.Yet, the relationship between drone strikes and temporal distinctions of war and peace is much more complex. Recent developments in national security policy show much more than an incidental connection between the two.We may soon enter a point in which autonomous weapon systems actually define the distinction between war and peace.
In the past few years, the United States has pursued counterterrorism operations throughout the world while minimizing the commitment of American troops throughout the world. As a result, U.S. national security policy has become increasingly dependent on weapons technologies to replace conventional forces.Granted, this is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it significantly echoes Eisenhower’s policy of massive retaliation. However, nuclear weapons did not influence the distinction between war and peace since they represented the culmination of total war. Drone strikes may influence the nature of modern warfare in much more profound ways.West Africa may have already set the precedent for these changes. In October, France <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/22/france-drones-mali-insurgents"">announced that it would send drones to Mali as an effort to combat Islamic insurgents. A couple of weeks ago, France made the decision to send actual combat forces to the region. In response to this announcement, the United Kingdom provided combat support units, which is a fairly typical response in these situations. At the same time, the United States has <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/29/niger-approves-american-surveillance-drones"">announced that it will build a drone base in Niger to support counterterrorism operations in West Africa.France’s decision to use drones acted as only one stage of escalation towards war in a manner similar to the deployment of support units. Similarly, the decision of the United States to establish a drone base operates in a manner similar to the traditional practice of support troops in post-conflict settings.These developments, along with the proliferation of drone bases throughout the world, point to a world in which the distinction between peace and war defines itself in terms of the decision to deploy people as opposed to technology. Since drones represent an escalation towards combat or a withdrawal from combat, times of war may only occur in relation to the use of actual combat forces rather than the use of technologies like drones.However, this distinction is troubling on several levels. To start, drones have combat abilities in themselves. If these definitions of war and peace took effect, a tool of war may be used in a time of peace, particularly as a final step before the decision to deploy combat forces. At best, the new definition of war and peace remains nebulous. At worst, all drone strikes may violate the laws of war, a concept with particularly daunting consequences for the strategic doctrine of the Obama administration.To get around this difficulty, then, the laws of war would require the use of armed drones only in accompaniment with the use of combat forces, in a manner similar to the current use of American combat drones in Afghanistan.Although this requirement may negate the strategic advantage of a drone strike, namely the ability to target enemy combatants without risking the lives of your own soldiers, it also provides several advantages. It ensures the presence of human intelligence on the ground, which is necessary to minimize collateral damage, and it negates the biggest risk of armed combat drones, by reducing the cost of military engagement to the point that force no longer becomes a necessary option of last resort.By connecting the use of armed drone strikes to a time of war necessitating the use of combat forces, policymakers could reduce the current ambiguities of national security policy, a field defined partly by our attempts to provide order in a fundamentally anarchic world.Raul Quintana ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Leverett House.

To the editor:In her editorial “<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/11/rethinking-teach-for-america/"">Rethink TFA”, Emma M. Lind urges seniors who might be considering applying to Teach For America to consider other pathways into teaching. There are a number of excellent options; however, TFA remains one of the most impactful career choices you can make if you are passionate about education. Being a TFA corps member has had a greater impact on my career than any other decision I have made, including choosing to attend Harvard.I joined the Baltimore TFA corps in 2000 and went on to teach in my placement school for three years. The training and coaching I received helped me improve significantly throughout my first year; it also inspired me to stay teaching beyond my two-year commitment and to help coach other beginning teachers. A significant body of research shows that this support works. <a href=""http://www.teachforamerica.org/our-organization/research"">Studies by independent institutions such as <a href=""http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/teach.pdf"">Mathematic Policy Research and the <a href=""http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411642_Teach_America.pdf"">Urban Institute have found that students taught by TFA members performed as well as, or better than, students taught by non-TFA teachers.More compelling than any study to me, however, are the ninth grade students I taught. I will never forget one  student, Cornell. When I first met Cornell, he skipped school, failed to complete homework, and was multiple grade levels behind. But with the help of his grandparents, counselor, me, and the other teachers on the ninth grade team, he turned it around and even asked for a front row seat as well as tutoring and extra work. Like so many of my other students, Cornell taught me that all students want to succeed, and that it is up to us as educators to ensure they have the opportunity to do so.If you enter teaching through TFA, you will also become a part of network of committed educators, advocates, and entrepreneurs. Almost two-thirds of TFA alumni <a href=""http://www.teachforamerica.org/sites/default/files/2012-13_Press_Kit_Updated_08_28_12.pdf"">continue full-time in education, like me, and more than half of those in education are <a href=""http://www.teachforamerica.org/blog/lifting-voices-our-alumni-teachers"">still teaching. As the leaders and founders of exciting entrepreneurial organizations for education reform, TFA alumni are having a tremendous <a href=""http://educationnext.org/creating-a-corps-of-change-agents/"">impact across the country.
TFA is certainly not the solution to all the problems that plague our education system. But TFA and its almuni are—without a doubt—making a positive impact on the lives of thousands of students. If you believe, as I do, that closing the achievement gap is the most important civil rights issue of our time, then I hope you will consider applying to Teach For America today.Nicole B. Dorn ’98Boston, Mass.To the editor:Originally a 2008 Teach for America Mississippi Delta Corps Member, I currently work as an instructional coach and writing teacher at a public charter school in Harlem. In a recent editorial, Emma M. Lind, one of my fellow Delta alums, encouraged Harvard seniors to “<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/11/rethinking-teach-for-america/"">Rethink TFA.” With the final application due today, I feel compelled to say: think again.Lind doubts TFA’s effectiveness. She argues that prospective teachers should opt for traditional certification programs instead. Like Lind, I grapple with many tough questions about the TFA. I wonder about the issues raised by its brief summer training, aggressive expansion, and arrogant undertones of its marketing campaign.But at the end of the day, I can’t agree that traditional certification programs necessarily build better teachers. I have worked with many educators from traditional schools of education and from TFA. In my experience, both crops produce bad, good, and great apples. This has been true in every setting I’ve worked: charter, public, rural, and urban.Granted, my experience is my own. Dozens of studies, similar to those cited by Lind, attempt to offer a broader, more objective perspective. But these studies reach conclusions that are contradictory and thus unpersuasive. Supporters and detractors can both find support in papers that raise more questions than answers. Most frustrating are their inconsistent metrics of what constitutes ""effective"" teaching, which is an art and science most difficult to measure.It saddens me when conversations in education reform equivocate over trees and miss the forest. At the end of the day, we need fantastic people in our nation’s classrooms. Some will come from certification programs. Others will come through Teach for America. Honestly, it doesn’t matter. Teaching is a surprising and unbelievably challenging job. The first years will throw you, no matter your training. The people who survive—and thrive—do so not based on what they have done, but what they are willing to do.So, when it comes to you and teaching, that is all I want to know. What are you willing to do for your future students? If your answer is “anything”—and if you mean it—get yourself in a classroom. Get there however you want. Apply to TFA. Apply to a fellowship. Apply to ed school. There is no single path to becoming a great teacher. Do what makes sense, what feels right, for you. After all, people learn and grow in very different ways—a secret that any great teacher can tell you.Andy Malone ’08New York, NY

After almost three decades of representing Massachusetts in the Senate, Secretary of State John F. Kerry has moved onto to bigger and better things. The former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry has left big shoes to fill. His replacement, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, does not appear to be up to the task. Upon assuming Kerry’s old job, Menendez was hit by a barrage of ethical misconduct allegations in connection with his relationship to Dr. Salomon E. Melgen, an eye-surgeon who has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/nyregion/senator-menendezs-ties-to-political-donor-are-scrutinized.html?ref=robertmenendez"">donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns.Late last month, Dr. Melgen’s offices were <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/nyregion/fbi-raids-offices-of-doctor-tied-to-menendez.html?ref=robertmenendez"">raided by the F.B.I. Though the government kept mum about the search, disturbing details soon emerged. Menendez had <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/nyregion/investigators-say-menendez-intervened-on-friends-behalf.html?ref=robertmenendez"">intervened on Dr. Melgen’s behalf in a dispute with Medicare about billing procedures. In 2010, Dr. Melgen had treated Menendez to free flights to the Dominican Republic aboard his private airplane. Some unsubstantiated reports <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/02/11/media-scolded-for-ignoring-menendez-prostitution-allegations/"">claimed that while on vacation there the two hired underage prostitutes.The facts surrounding this case are murky, and no doubt things will come into clearer focus over the next few weeks. The Senate Ethics Committee has begun its own review and Menendez has not been criminally charged. We cannot yet call on him to resign his seat. Nonetheless, the unrecompensed rides, which he finally paid for, represent a severe ethical lapse on their own. The charges also indicate, if not prove, a willingness to place the profit margins of his donors before the national interest. Menendez, for example, may have <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/nyregion/port-deal-pushed-by-menendez-could-also-benefit-ex-aide.html?ref=robertmenendez"">pushed the U.S. to enforce a Dominican port security plan because it benefit a corporation owned by Dr. Melgen.Menendez asserts that he has committed no improprieties. He never had sex with prostitutes. He interceded with Medicare to simplify a byzantine reimbursement process. Clerical errors were responsible for the non-disclosure of the plane rides. His involvement in the port security matter was motivated by substantive policy concerns. All this may be true, but how credulous can be we be? A mountain of evidence and an air smacking of “Boardwalk Empire” suggest otherwise.The Foreign Relations Committee is one of the Senate’s most important bodies. Menendez’s troubles cannot distract from its critical work. Neither should it be led by a man who might monetize the position to detrimental effect. For the duration of the ethics inquiry, Menendez should step down from his post. It wouldn’t be proper to replace John Kerry with a Senator who, if the allegations are true, appears to be only slightly less corrupt than “Boardwalk Empire’s” <a href=""http://boardwalkempire.wikia.com/wiki/Walter_Edge"">Walter Edge.

Kenyatta Smith had been waiting 80 days for another opportunity.That’s how long it had been since the Harvard sophomore was pulled from the starting lineup following the men’s basketball team’s 85-78 loss to Vermont, a game in which he had committed three turnovers and three fouls.Smith spent most of the Crimson’s next 15 games watching from the bench, as Harvard went 11-4 with sophomore Jonah Travis starting at center.But following the Crimson’s 78-63 loss at Columbia last Saturday, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker decided to give Smith another chance. At Wednesday’s practice, Amaker informed the team that Smith would replace Travis in the lineup for the Crimson’s Friday night matchup against Penn.“I was a little nervous,” Smith said of his reaction when he learned of Amaker’s decision. “I didn’t want to let [Amaker] down. He had a lot of faith in me. He told me that he was counting on me. I didn’t want to let him down. I didn’t want to let my team down.”
Smith certainly didn’t do that.In an historic night, the 6’8” center posted 20 points, nine rebounds, and 10 blocks—all career highs and the latter a program record. The performance spurred the Crimson (15-7, 7-1 Ivy) to a 73-54 victory over Penn (6-18, 3-4), Harvard’s most comfortable conference win of the season.“I made the decision to go with [Smith] because we needed an inside, interior presence for scoring and certainly his rebounding ability,” Amaker said. “I never anticipated him getting 10 blocks, but we need him to protect our rim.”Thanks in large part to Smith’s interior presence, Penn struggled to get into a rhythm offensively, scoring just 54 points on 34.9 percent shooting—its third lowest clip of the season.Quakers guards Miles Cartwright and Tony Hicks, who entered the contest averaging 14 and 12 points per game in Ivy League play, respectively, were limited to just 15 combined points on five-of-21 shooting from the field.“I was very pleased with our defense,” Amaker said. “I thought we played an exceptional game defensively in pretty much both halves, which is something we haven’t really done all year. I thought we had great discipline, great focus.”On the other side of the court, the Crimson was efficient on offense, connecting on 52.3 percent of its shots from the floor and five-of-13 from deep.Coming off a career-high 27-point performance in last Saturday’s loss at Columbia, sophomore Wesley Saunders continued to fill the basket on Friday. The 6’5” wing posted 17 first-half points and finished with 23, a game high.“Obviously Wesley was very efficient with how he played,” said Amaker of the sophomore, who shot seven-of-12 from the field and got to the charity stripe 11 times.With the score knotted at 9-9 early in the first half, Saunders sparked a 14-4 Harvard run, knocking down a triple from the left wing off a pass from co-captain Christian Webster.

Last year, the Harvard women’s squash team (12-1, 6-1 Ivy) wrested the Howe Cup from Yale at the 2012 CSA National Championships. The Crimson stepped easily over its opponents, dropping only one match for a 26-1 total tally for the tournament.This season, with title in hand, the team showed that it would not lose its momentum. Harvard has powered through a successful season with very few bumps along the way. The team now faces the challenge of defending its win on the home court of its Connecticut rival. The host of this year’s national championship, Yale (11-4, 4-3) has its eyes set on the title after last year’s second place finish.The Crimson wrapped up its Ivy competition last weekend with a match against Yale. Though Harvard beat the Bulldogs in a comfortable 7-2 win, co-captain Sarah Mumanachit showed that the team can compete in a pinch by overtaking her opponent in the fifth game for a 3-2 win.The Crimson enters this weekend with a near-perfect regular season record. Harvard did not let a midseason loss to Princeton (11-0, 7-0) break its stride. Looking forward, the Crimson is eager for another shot at the Tigers but will use its previous defeat to inform its approach. Co-captain Natasha Kingshott sees no reason to allow Princeton to shake the team’s confidence, should the draw pit them together.“We have nothing to lose,” Kingshott said. “We’ve learned so much from our previous loss that we’re going to rise to the occasion.  We’re really looking forward to another shot at it.”
Undefeated on the season, the Tigers look to be a top threat to take home the title this year. Princeton dropped a 7-2 decision against Yale in last year’s national semifinals, then fell to Trinity by the same margin in the consolation round.After this year’s regular season loss to the Tigers, Harvard rattled off seven straight wins. The team immediately trounced Hamilton and Amherst in a clean sweep and proceeded to finish the regular season without suffering another defeat.The team benefits from strong players in every class. The talented class of 2015 is looking forward to its second opportunity to play in the national championship. They continue to support the team by supplying three out of the six players with undefeated records in the regular season, and they look to bring a new level of maturity with another season under their belts.“We’ve matured a lot from last year,” sophomore Amanda Sobhy said. “We’ve learned from mistakes and gotten a lot [smarter] on court. We’re playing mature squash, and we’re doing a lot better.”Though the sophomores are a tough act to follow, the class of 2016 is bringing a solid record to its first national championship. Freshman Allie Sperry went undefeated in the regular season, and her classmates played important roles in bringing about many of the team’s victories.“The freshmen have been great,” Sobhy said. “They’ve been really great assets to the team. They’ve been working hard and they’ve been doing really well.”In hopes of defending a national title, the Crimson is practicing at an intensity that keeps the team just under the breaking point. The team’s leadership will head up the attempt to strike the right combination.“I think it’s a fine balance between pushing yourself at a really high, intense level, and not burning out,” Kingshott said. “Each player is taking the initiative in their individual training.”With the national championship just a few days away, the team is sticking to business as usual.“I don’t think we’re really changing anything,” Mumanachit said. “Now it’s just crossing our t’s and dotting our i’s.”Harvard looks to begin this weekend’s matches with the same level of energy and intensity it has carried thus far this season.“We’re making sure we’re hungry and [that] we’re approaching this weekend with an upward momentum,” Kingshott said. “It’s a shame we won’t have the same home support we did last year, but we’re a resilient team, and we’re going to walk into that facility ready to play in any situation, in any environment, against any opponent.”

This Valentine’s Day, FM charts the course of true literary love—platonic and romantic—across Harvard’s campus and through the ages. Adrienne C. Rich ‘51Radcliffe QuadrangleRich didn’t publish her seminal “Twenty-One Love Poems” until 1976—two decades after she graduated from Radcliffe. Even so, some of those poems evoke the intensity of college love: “We want to live like trees, / sycamores blazing through the sulfuric air, / dappled with scars, still exuberantly budding, / our animal passion rooted in the city.” Ralph Waldo Emerson, Class of 1821 &amp; Henry David Thoreau, Class of 1837 
Hollis HallAlthough these two literary giants and famous friends probably did not, despite legend, live together at Harvard, Thoreau did later stay on Emerson’s estate. One visitor recalled, “[Thoreau] was much at home with Emerson: and as he remained through the afternoon and evening, and I left him still at the fireside, he appeared to me to belong in some way to the household... [Emerson] seemed to anticipate [Thoreau’s] views, preparing himself obviously for a quiet laugh at Thoreau’s negative and biting criticism.” Harold Brodkey ’52Widener LibraryBrodkey published his first short story collection, “First Love and Other Sorrows,” just six years after graduation. It features “Sentimental Education,” a tale of a romance between a Harvard boy and a Radcliffe girl that opens on the Widener steps and closes in front of Adams House—Ali MacGraw does not make an appearance. Frank R. O’Hara ’50 &amp; Edward S. J. Gorey ’50Eliot HouseBefore O’Hara urged Lana Turner, “we love you get up” in his “Lunch Poems,” or Gorey illustrated an alphabet of deaths in “The Gashlycrumb Tinies,” the two were roommates in Eliot House. “They gave the best parties,” poet Donald Hall ’51 said, as quoted in a 2007 Harvard Magazine article. What did an O’Hara/Gorey soirée feature? As reported by O’Hara’s biographer, Frank Gooch, party guests lay on chaise lounges and listened to Marlene Dietrich records. Robert L. Frost, Honorary Class of 1937Adams House Frost, an associate of Adams House, famously wrote in his 1920 poem “Fire and Ice,” “Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice. / From what I’ve tasted of desire / I hold with those who favor fire...” It’s a powerful sentiment, but it might be a little much to drop into a note to your Valentine this year.

Without its leading freshman scorer for the second straight game, the Harvard men’s hockey team once again turned to its seniors to provide an offensive spark. They did.Three goals from senior forwards—one from assistant captain Alex Fallstrom and two from Marshall Everson—lifted the Crimson (7-15-2, 4-12-1 ECAC) to a 4-1 win over Colgate (13-12-4, 5-9-3 ECAC) at the Bright Hockey Center on Friday evening.  Harvard picked up its first in-conference victory since Nov. 16.“There’s been a lot of frustration, quite honestly, over the last couple of months, and they could almost taste a victory,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think there were some real big plays in the game that we lacked earlier in the season.”Everson posted two markers less than four minutes apart in the back-half of the second period to provide Harvard a two-goal advantage.More than 11 minutes into the second frame, a rebound from freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo pinballed off the leg of Everson as the senior crashed the crease. The strike put the Crimson up, 2-1.
Moments later, Everson received a Criscuolo feed from the right-wing boards before deking the puck past Colgate freshman goaltender Spencer Finney.“Criscuolo made an incredible pass to me,” Everson said of his second goal. “I thought [Finney] might be reading a one-timer, so I just wanted to hold it for a second there and try to get him out of position.”After a scoreless first period in which the Raiders outshot Harvard, 10-5, the Crimson opened the second firing on all cylinders. Fallstrom slid the puck under the pads of a scrambling Finney less than one minute into the frame as Harvard bombarded the net.“We started slow in the game, so in between periods we had to start to take control,” Everson said. “We had to get back to our game plan of getting the puck in deep and trying to forecheck. I think when we started doing that and simplifying our game, we saw the successes come.”Colgate took little time to respond to Fallstrom’s goal, immediately peppering junior goaltender Raphael Girard with shots following the score. The Raiders broke through on the man advantage as Billy Rivellini converted on a tick-tack passing play.But Harvard quickly found itself in the driver’s seat again. Everson’s goals put the contest out of reach as the Colgate attack collapsed down the stretch. Girard finished with a game-high 27 saves.“We did what we needed to do,” Donato said. “I thought we played pretty intelligently in the third period, outside of the fact that we had some penalty trouble. We didn’t turn the puck over and made good plays to get it out and get it in and allowed [Girard] to see the puck most of the time.”The Raiders managed only four shots on goal in the final frame despite three power plays. A clear from junior defender Dan Ford skidded into an empty net with less than 30 seconds left in regulation for the Crimson’s fourth goal of the night.Harvard has played the last two games without sharp-shooting freshman forward Jimmy Vesey, who is out with a lower body injury. Yet in each of those two games, veterans have provided an extra scoring punch.“Obviously Jimmy’s an important part of our team and one that we hope to have back,” Donato said. “We’ve had some guys step up, and I think we’re getting more guys involved. More guys are hitting their stride a little bit. It’s a good time of the year to do it.”The first three goals of the night required video review. Officials examined and cleared Everson’s game-winner for any kicking motion that could have propelled the puck into the net.“I saw [the puck] come off the pad and was hoping that it would hit me somewhere in the body and go in,” Everson said. “I didn’t want to touch it with my hand, didn’t want to kick it in. Just hoped my body’s momentum would carry it in.”With its 7-4 win over Boston University on Monday, Harvard earned its first pair of back-to-back wins since beating RPI, 4-0, and Cornell, 4-1, on Nov. 10 and Nov. 16, respectively. The Crimson’s last three games comprise its longest unbeaten streak of the season.“I think our guys certainly played with a greater level of desperation,” Donato said. “That’s something we want to continue to improve upon.”—Staff Writer Michael D.

For 51 straight conference games, No. 9 Penn State had dominated its EIVA foes. But that streak came to an end Friday night against the Crimson.The Harvard men’s volleyball team got revenge against this conference rival in a historic victory at the Malkin Athletic Center. With the win, the Crimson (6-2, 2-1 EIVA) beat the Nittany Lions (9-3, 3-1 EIVA) for the first time in school history.  Harvard’s three set sweep of Penn State marks the first time the Nittany Lions have lost a conference game in almost five years.With a two set advantage, Harvard took a 19-13 lead in the third set before Penn State clawed its way back to make it 24-23.  The large home crowd rose to its feet to watch what would be the final point of the match, another kill from sophomore outside hitter DJ White, who had a team-high 13 on the day.The Crimson knew it could compete with the Nittany Lions, having taken them to five sets each of the last two times the squads had played.“We had watched a lot of tape,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said.  “We knew what they were going to do on offense and we knew that they had so many good hitters that we needed to slow them down somehow.  We blocked well, and our defensive back row was great.”
White and junior libero Chris Gibbons helped lead Harvard’s strong defense as they recorded five digs apiece.  Sophomore Caleb Zimmick led the team in blocks with five.“We just took time to relax [in practice this week],” freshman hitter Branden Clemens said. “We took the time to go back and focus on the fundamentals, polish everything, and get back on our game.”The Crimson also delivered a strong offensive performance, recording a .457 hitting percentage that was its best mark of the season.“I thought we played an extraordinary match,” Baise said. “We made so few errors.Our passers did a great job, which was the main thing.”Harvard was coming off of a sloppy victory over Rivier on Feb. 5th, and it knew it would have to play better to earn a win against Penn State.“I give the team a lot of credit,” co-captain Rob Lothman said.  “I give coach a lot of credit for leading us in practice, and making [us] really fight everyday in practice this week like we were playing these guys tonight. I think that really showed on the court.”The Crimson rolled in the second set, jumping out to a 12-6 lead.  It would maintain the lead throughout the second set, winning it with ease, 25-17.“[After the second set] we called everyone in,” the senior setter said. “And said, ‘This is the set we need to take. We cannot let this go four sets. We cannot let down and have a mental lapse right now.’ And we went out and executed.”After falling down 16-13 in the first set, Harvard came out of a timeout and rattled off five straight points to take control. It went on to win the third frame, 25-23.

“Be Mine.” “True Love.” “Cutie Pie.” “Fax Me.”For well over a century, lovers the world over have expressed their feelings on Valentine’s Day through red ink on a chalky pastel candy. Today, lovestruck sweet tooths consume 12 to 14 million pounds of the stuff each year.All of it is made less than 10 miles from Harvard Square, in Revere, Mass.—home to the New England Confectionary Company, maker of the indomitable Sweetheart.The plant is ordinarily closed to visitors, but it’s amazing what one can accomplish with an email starting “Hello, I am a writer for The Harvard Crimson, as well as a very big fan of Sky Bars and Sweethearts.”*—

A walk through NECCO’s massive factory is a step back into the peak era of American manufacturing. Nearly all of the machines which are used today to make NECCO candies have been around since before World War II. The trusty machinery is still at it now, making not only Sweethearts but also the familiar disc-shaped NECCO Wafers, the bright candy buttons that many of us ate off paper strips as children, and an assortment of lesser-known candies with names like Slap Stix, Peach Blossoms, and Squirrel Nut Zippers.NECCO’s founders were at the cutting edge of confectionary innovation back in 1847, when Oliver Chase created the lozenge cutter which led to the development of NECCO Wafers.(The recipe, for flavors like clove, cinnamon, and wintergreen, hasn’t changed since then aside from an ill-fated experiment with all-natural flavorings in 2009.) In the 1860s, Oliver’s brother thought of printing messages on the candies in red dye. In 1902, the company started printing them in heart shapes.But a little less than a century after the Chase brothers’ ingenious inventions, NECCO froze in time, more or less. The holy trinity of candy making—Hershey, Mars, and Nestle—successfully automated every step of the process, from mixing to molding to wrapping up the candy bars and shipping them out the door. Not at NECCO.At the NECCO factory, an employee dumps food coloring into metal pails full of steaming hot liquid, whisks the batter, and pours it into a machine caked in a coral-reef-bright accumulation of rainbow batter. That machine then drips the intensely colored liquid onto sheets of edible paper, thereby forming 1,000 pounds of candy buttons every day. Four women manually shove finished buttons, which have cooled for a week, into cellophane bags, while another employee drops each bag into a machine that seals it with a puff of steam. Two more box the bags for shipping.Someday NECCO will be forced to automate, plant manager Hugh Albert says. But right now, the company, which was bought by the venture capital firm American Capital Strategies in 2007, simply doesn’t have the money for new machines. And despite worries about how the company will stay in business, Albert likes it just the way it is.“I love to see it, because it’s all about the nostalgia, seeing how this process has been done for 70 or 80 years,” he says. Plus, he says, there’s “the human element of it: I love to see people employed.”—A few decades ago, it would have been hard to predict that M&amp;Ms and Hershey Kisses would be household names while Canada Mints and Mary Janes would become also-rans.NECCO looked just as poised to become a major sugary power as any other company, as the history lesson on its website would tell it. NECCO Wafers went off to war with Union soldiers in the 1860s and to the South Pole with Admiral Byrd in the 1930s. When the lights came back on in Times Square at the end of World War II, New Yorkers flocked to see the re-lit NECCO Sky Bar sign.

Tables covered in gourmet chocolate, pastries, and gift bags of donated cosmetics filled the YWCA in Cambridge Thursday during its 10th annual Valentine’s Day Cosmetics Drive.Women of all ages and walks of life painted nails, gave each other massages and henna tattoos, and shared life stories—including some about love—throughout the three-hour event, which has become a cherished tradition at the YWCA shelter.The program was founded in 2003 by former Quincy House Master Jayne Loader, who, along with Dunster House Master Ann Porter, took two bags of collected cosmetics from the Harvard community to the YWCA the week before Valentine’s day that year. “Jayne’s reasoning was, ‘What could be worse than running from an abusive spouse, at a shelter, on Valentine’s day, without a date?’” said Robert M. Gogan, Harvard’s associate manager for recycling services.Harvard’s Office for Sustainability began spearheading the collection of nail polish, hair treatments, shampoos, perfumes, colognes, soaps, makeup and other toiletries in the month leading up to Valentine’s Day. They increased their efforts after observing large numbers of unused cosmetics in the trash during spring moveout, said Gogan.The drive has grown from a couple of bags of cosmetics to one ton of donations. These are divided into gift bags for each of the more than 100 women who live permanently in the Tanner Residence of the YWCA Family Shelter.
This year, Loader returned for the 10th anniversary of the drive to drop off donations at the YWCA. The interns and employees of the shelter team up with members of Harvard’s Resource Efficiency Program to decorate the shelter with pink streamers and glitter and provide refreshments for the women who come to receive the donations.“[It] was just great to be with the women,” said Schuyler S. Engel, case manager of the Tanner House. “Women who live here have all had amazing lives.”Linda K. King, a resident of the shelter, said that the volunteers “really make a big effort to do something really pleasant” and described the event as “sort of like a cocktail party.” Another resident, Yoko Hershiki, said that the afternoon made her feel loved.“When I walk into the building, there is so much warmth,” Hershiki said of the event’s atmosphere. “This is about love; love between friends, between neighbors. It’s about girls getting together.”As residents picked their way through baskets of varying shades of lipstick, trying to find ones that would suit them best, they reminisced about family and past relationships.“When I get thinner and get my mobility back, men better watch out,” said King.For many of the residents, the real benefit of the event had nothing to do with material goods. “It’s nice to know that people care about this place, the YWCA,” said Hershiki. “People care about us, about everybody, black or white, young or old, it doesn’t matter. It’s just love and it’s in this room.”—Staff writer Indrani G. Das can be reached at idas@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on twitter at <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/IndraniGDas"">@IndraniGDas.

February 22-24, February 28-March 2“punkplay”By Gregory S. MossDirected by Jacob A. Brandt ’14Produced by Andrew P. Gelfand ’15 and Josef A. Durand ’14
   The music of the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, and the Minutemen will blare throughout ""punkplay,"" directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14 and opening in the Loeb Ex on February 22. The play is less a portrait of the 1980s punk scene than a coming-of-age story that tackles issues of isolation and conformity. “The play tells a story that we’re all familiar with,” Brandt says. “We’ve just lived through this chapter of our lives.” “punkplay,” written by recent Brown graduate Gregory Moss, unfolds in disjointed episodes, each informed by a famous punk song. The plot follows the relationship between high school students Duck (Mark J. Mauriello ’15) and Mickey (Matt J. Bialo ’15) as they turn to the punk mindset of Reagan’s America. Duck, hot-tempered and manipulative, serves as the antagonist to the more reserved and vulnerable Mickey.   “You can almost see them as two halves of the same person,” Mauriello says. “But it’s also a love story.” As the two grapple with their own changing relationship and immerse themselves in the world of punk, they begin to realize that their new culture may be just as oppressive as the one from which they came. The versatile black box of the Loeb Ex will allow Brandt and his four-person cast—which also includes Lily R. Glimcher ’14 and Christian N. Fohrby ’14—to approach the staging creatively. The characters will be on roller skates the whole time, though they will mostly ignore them, walking clunkily around the Cambridge bedroom in which the whole play takes place. By framing the show in a box within the larger black box theater, Brandt hopes to heighten focus and intimacy. “This play has been with me for a long time,” Brandt says. “It’s been really interesting to explore these characters, internally and externally, and watch them come alive.” —Staff writer Andrew Chow can be reached at andrewchow@college.harvard.edu.

This is the third instalment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues.If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic ""Should organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America be allowed to exclude a person from membership on the basis of freedom of association?"" please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday, Feb. 21 at 6 pm . More Questions than AnswersDrones and other autonomous weapons systems have provided several strategic benefits to counterterrorism operations. They allow for nearly unlimited reconnaissance with a level of detail that satellites cannot provide and endurance that human intelligence cannot maintain. They also provide an incredibly valuable tool by pursuing enemy combatants without the risk to human life, a fact which may explain their <a href=""http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/cbs-poll-broad-bipartisan-support-for-drone-program"">broad public support.
Yet, drones do not yet follow an established operative framework, which has raised several significant questions about their use. One question involves the rule of law, both in terms of their use in non-combat zones abroad and the current lack of executive transparency at home.Another question concerns the paradox of intelligence gathering. Since drones inherently depend on human intelligence to confirm opportunities and targets, we can only trust them to the extent that we trust the information which legitimates their use. At the same time, drones may actually increase mistrust of the West and fuel anti-American sentiment, which in turn makes intelligence gathering more difficult.However, there is another, more significant problem. By removing the human beings from the equation, drones may actually cheapen armed conflict to the point that it becomes a primary option rather than a last resort.The ultimate question raised by drones then is what happens next—could armed conflict become a preferred option to diplomacy? Could a state of war become a permanent aspect of modern life if unit production is the only cost? And, in the short term, could drones unnecessarily prolong a conflict in which there is no strategic definition of victory, such as a war against ideology? Already, some would argue that the answer is yes.Yes, drones have provided some significant strategic benefits, but we cannot evaluate their worth until we find answers to the questions they raise.Raul P. Quintana ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Leverett House. His column appears on alternate Fridays.Drones Require Different Moral ApproachThe drone strikes employed by the Obama Administration are ""necessary"" only insofar as they fit into the moral calculus inherent in being the country's Commander-in-Chief. As weapons of mass terror, drones can hold entire Afghani cities hostage to periods of perpetual fear and suffering. However, unlike an American occupation, they require fewer forces on the ground and thus save American lives. The implicit moral calculation a President must make is how many foreign lives are worth one American life.A common-sense humanitarian—nay, most Americans—would probably argue that the ratio is one to one. However the logic is different for an American president whose political capital fluctuates directly with his approval ratings. Wars are unpopular. Although the drone campaign is a burdensome evil abroad, it is a preferable domestic political strategy because it keeps young Americans in school instead of on the battlefield.In this sense drones have been necessary in justifying the War on Terror. Abroad, they have also served various military objectives. As they do not require congressional approval to be launched, drones give the executive branch unilateral direction in ordering and carrying out attacks on targets. The military has <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-10-23/world/35500278_1_drone-campaign-obama-administration-matrix"">pushed for an increase in the use of drones instead of ground troops, members of whom have brought public relations stains to the army by <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-08-27/world/35491373_1_afghan-soldiers-koran-burnings-criminal-charges"">burning Korans and <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/marines-charged-corpse-urination-video-article-1.1259330"">publicly urinating on corpses. In relation to boots on the ground, drones are superior to troops for two main reasons: they are more effective and they minimize the risk of American fatalities.

The Cambridge Public Health Department and the Cambridge City Council have fallen out of step on a proposal to limit the amount of soda served in Cambridge restaurants. As members of the Council look to begin exploring the logistics of a soda limitation, the Public Health Department is still unsure whether such a regulation is prudent.Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, Chair of the Cambridge City Council’s Community Health Committee, said she hopes to meet with the business community in the next month and assemble a task force on the soda limitation shortly thereafter. But according to Public Health Department spokeswoman Suzy Feinberg, the department will not submit its formal recommendations to the city until late spring­­—nearly a year after the City Council <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/6/20/cambridge-considers-soda-ban/"">first requested a recommendation on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages in June 2012. That request came soon after Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City proposed capping the size of sodas served in New York at a volume of 16 ounces.“One of the key issues is whether this type of restriction will result in lower consumption of sugary beverages and reduction in overall caloric intake,” Feinberg wrote to The Crimson in an email. At a meeting with the Council’s Public Health Committee on Jan. 9, the department raised doubts that the proposal would diminish soda intake.“Does limiting soda size make sense, if people can still buy large size beverages in retail establishments, such as supermarkets and corner stores?” asked Claude-Alix Jacob, Cambridge’s chief public health officer. He added that consumers could also order more servings of soda at restaurants.When the Council discussed the soda regulation proposal on Jan. 28, Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/29/council-soda-ban/"">voiced concerns about infringing on personal liberties.
But fellow Councillor Craig A. Kelley said he would expect a soda regulation to pass if it were put before the City Council. And Decker said that the final decision does not rest exclusively with the Public Health Department. “This is not [Jacob’s] decision; this is the Council’s decision,” she said.The Public Health Department and the City Council expressed similarly different opinions in 2006, when the Council asked for a recommendation on the topic of trans fat regulation in Cambridge restaurants.The department recommended educating restaurateurs about the dangers of trans fat but would not endorse a full ban on trans fats, saying that a lasting relationship with the restaurant community outweighed the short-term benefit of banning trans fat use.The following year, the City Council established a task force that ultimately did ban trans fat from Cambridge restaurants.“When I brought the order in to ban trans fat, the Public Department was not sure,” said Decker. “Ultimately, the whole state decided that Cambridge was right.”—Staff writer Sonali Y.

Dozens of students flocked to the Harvard Independent’s annual speed dating event Thursday night in search of love—or, for the first time this year, friendship.The Valentine’s Day matchmaking affair, which took place in Boylston Hall’s Ticknor Lounge, featured traditional speed dates as well as the addition of platonic “speed friending.” The pairs of speed daters negotiated the terms of the date at the start of their three-minute conversations.Angela Y. Song ’14, the president of the Independent, estimated that most students went on traditional speed dates, though some did choose to try speed friending. She said she was pleased by the overall turnout.“I think a lot of people had a great time, and people were able to meet a lot of other people,” Song said.Attendees enjoyed Finale chocolate ganache and blueberry cheesecake, as well as an unusually balanced gender ratio. According to Song, this year’s event drew more men than usual.
“Typically there’s been a much better female turnout, but this year there was a more balanced ratio,” Song said.Advertising in advance of the event stressed inclusivity. Fliers and emails circulated over House lists stated that all identities were welcome, and the registration form asked students to list their contact information, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/31/On-Their-Own-Terms/"">preferred gender pronoun, and sexuality. Daters were not placed into separate groups at the event based on their answers.The evening opened with a brief mingling session, and then funneled into three-minute speed dates. Daters were provided with conversations starters—including “Tina Fey or Amy Poehler?”—printed on slips of paper.Students at the event had varying ideas about what the night might have in store.Some said they came as a favor for their more enthusiastic roommates, but no one interviewed at the event admitted to being the roommate who actually wanted be there. Others said they came to find a date, while still some admitted they were there just for the Finale deserts.Attendee Luke E. Sundquist ’14, who wore the number 10 on his chest, capitalized on the situation, joking that he came to “meet some friendly people [because] here they have to meet with me too.”

So you haven't done the readings, and you've been too busy constantly refreshing your Gmail in lecture to even know if your professor is a male, female, or just a potted plant. But you don't want your section TF to know this— that would kill your participation grade! So here are a few tips critical to surviving section.<!--more-->1. Look PreparedCamp out in the classroom early so that you can be there right when class starts. Stay there overnight if you have to. You may look over-eager—but that's what you are going for. If you get bored waiting you can take a nap in the tent you brought, or make s'mores!2. Bring Your ReadingsPull out all your books, not just for one section, but also for all of your classes; it will look like you've been doing outside research or at the very least did your readings. If your readings are all online, bring your favorite fiction book or dirty magazine. If you get enough books your can build a barrier between you and your TF to hide behind when he asks a hard question.
3. Be ExpressiveIf a picture is worth a thousand words, then a facial expression is worth at least five comments in section and half a response paper. Given that, you should always react to what your TF says. If she asks if you have done the reading, nod enthusiastically. If she summarizes a point, nod enthusiastically. When she asks a challenging question about the chemical bonds of methane, nod enthusiastically.4. Pronounce thingsIf any of your authors have French-sounding names, or your reading references a Latin phrase, memorize it and pull it out during section. You will look well-read and cultured when you drop Foucault's name or the term a priori during your Government or Chem 40 section.5. Office HoursGo. Especially if your TF is hot. If he or she isn't particularly good looking—hey, the odds are even more in your favor.

Harvard Management Company has created a new position devoted to researching and understanding sustainability issues related to the University’s $30.7 billion endowment.The new Vice President of Sustainable Investing will also serve as HMC’s primary liasion to other University offices on environmental, social, and governance investment issues.HMC, which oversees Harvard’s endowment, posted a job application for the new position on its website last week. The position is listed under HMC’s compliance team, which advises the Company’s investors on legal, tax, and regulatory issues.Jane L. Mendillo, President and CEO of HMC, said in a statement to The Crimson that the creation of the position aligns with HMC’s longterm outlook.“Given the growing conversation around sustainability and related issues on campus and across the financial sector, we wanted to develop a more integrated approach to these issues at HMC,” Mendillo said in the statement. “We are long-term investors and that means we are concerned with sustainability and stewardship. This new position will strengthen this longstanding focus at HMC.”
Although a Harvard spokesperson has said the University “operates with a strong presumption against divestment,” the push for socially responsible investment has recently gained momentum on campus. A month after College students passed a referendum in support of a social choice fund, the University <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/social-fund-university-mutual/"">announced plans in December to create such a fund separate from its existing endowment.Two weeks ago, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/28/social-choice-fund-meeting/"">five students met with members of the Harvard Corporation to discuss the details of the social choice fund, and earlier this week, a referendum to seed the social choice fund with money from Harvard’s endowment <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/14/kennedy-school-social-choice-fund/"">passed with 93 percent support of Harvard Kennedy School student voters.Student members of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, which was involved in coordinating the two student referendums, expressed cautious optimism about the creation of the new HMC position.“We were in general really pleased to see that the HMC is formally considering [environmental, social, and governance issues],” said Kevin S. Wang ’16, the investments and faculty coordinator of the Coalition.Similarly, S. Krishna Dasaratha ’13, the Coalition’s treasurer, praised the move as an “indicator” that the University is listening to a rising chorus of student concerns about Harvard’s investment.However, Wang and Dasaratha both said that the creation of the position, which primarily entails research on sustainable investment, does not necessarily mean that Harvard will commit to adjusting its investment strategies.In the hopes of compelling HMC to change its investment practices, Wang said, “We’re pushing for action.”—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nkansra01@college.harvard.edu.

Two undergraduates have transformed what began as an inspirational conversation with a journalist into an emerging campus initiative dedicated to improving maternal health.Last spring, Michelle J. Wang ’14 and Eunice Kim ’14-’15 had a conversation with Sheryl WuDunn, coauthor of “Half the Sky­­,” a book about global oppression of women. Wang and Kim were already keenly concerned about the issues of maternal morbidity and malnutrition, but WuDunn encouraged them to take the next step by organizing on campus.Now, after months of planning,  Wang and Kim have launched the Undergraduate Maternal Health Initiative. The club was approved by the Office of Student Life in November and will hold its first official meeting next week.“We’re hoping that it’s a way to raise awareness of maternal health and encourage college students to look at different avenues and ways to get involved in maternal health,” Wang said. “Maternal morbidity isn’t really well known.”Wang said that the organization already has about 20 members who work on three teams: research and development, finance and events, and publicity and public relations.
Jane Chung ’15, one of the co-chairs for the research and development team, said that she and other club members want to launch a pilot program, hopefully in partnership with the Massachusetts General Hospital, to educate Cambridge-area mothers about maintaining their health throughout and after pregnancy. “We’re really excited about the idea of creating an education curriculum, because that’s kind of lacking in maternal health,” Chung said.Members also hope to educate mothers on the importance of receiving clinical checkups during pregnancy.Jane Y. Suh ’14, also a co-chair for the research and development team, said that she was inspired to work with the initiative after studying global maternal mortality in a Harvard course.She said she and other team members have been exploring ways to promote maternal nutrition worldwide, including creating a program to educate mothers about healthy eating.“Especially in developing countries, [mothers] don’t really have access to foods or know what foods to eat to improve their own health and improve the health of their child,” she said. “We can provide awareness to these mothers and let them know what kinds of foods they should be taking.”During the Harvard College Women’s Center’s Women’s Week this semester, the group plans to host a screening of the second part of the PBS documentary film adapted from WuDunn’s book. Following the screening, the group’s advisor, Harvard School of Public Health professor Ana Langer, will field questions on maternal health.—Staff writer D.

A second-half deficit of 15 points proved too much to overcome as the Harvard women’s basketball team fell to the University of Pennsylvania, 77-72, at the Palestra on Friday night. The Crimson had not lost to the Quakers on the road since 2001 and had held a 17-game win streak against its Ivy foes prior to Friday’s loss.Harvard (13-7, 4-2 Ivy) was led by sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who eclipsed a personal best of 20 points set two weeks ago against Yale with a team-high 26 points for the night. Rookie Keiera Ray lit up the backcourt for Penn (10-9, 3-2) with 31 points.“This was the game of [Ray’s] life,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “The kid drove. We just didn’t play her right. You’ve got to stop the drive and not send her to the line. It was bizarre. We played in favor of her—not to take away from her night—she played a great ball game. I’ll be interested to look at the tapes to see what we can do to not let that happen again.”The freshman guard is the second-leading scorer for the Quakers, netting an average of 10.4 points per game.“We expected someone else to be the go-to person for them,” Fagbenle said. “Obviously for a team like that, they can change positions and leadership. I guess that girl stepped up and we just didn’t do what we needed to do to stop her, which is terrible. We can’t let anyone go off like that against us.”
It was a banner night for Fagbenle, who dominated on the glass, pulling down a game-high 13 boards and recording her fourth career double-double. This was the fourth consecutive contest in which she has netted double-digit points.“I didn’t even know I had those stats until someone told me,” Fagbenle said. “For me it doesn’t matter at all, especially if we lose.”Fagbenle was joined by senior forward Victoria Lippert, who had 13 points for the night, as the only two players to put up double digit figures in any measure for the visiting squad.Harvard fought from behind in both frames, but was unable to close the gap for a win. With just under 10 minutes to go in the game, Penn guard Alyssa Baron drove into the paint for a fastbreak lay-up that put her team on top by 15 points. All was not over for the Crimson, which went on a 14-0 run over the next five minutes to cut the Quaker lead to one. Fagbenle provided eight points during the scoring spree.“I just think we came together,” Fagbenle said. “We didn’t stop persevering. We played our offense and stopped them from scoring. When you have those two, we get more points. That’s kind of like feel good basketball, [having] a little fun.”The two teams quickly traded threes, with Lippert drilling a trey seconds after Penn’s Kathleen Roche sunk one from behind the arc. In the end, Harvard gave up six points from the charity stripe in the final 40 seconds, letting the Quakers pull off a win.“We staged a nice comeback in the second half to erase the 15-point lead but we just fell short at the end,” Delaney-Smith said.The Crimson fell behind early in the game, trailing by as many as eight points during the first period.Down 17-12 with 10:44 left in the opening half, free throws from Fagbenle and junior guard Christine Clark, sandwiching a three from senior guard Elle Hagedorn, brought the score to 19-19.  Fagbenle followed with a lay-up to give her team its first lead. But Harvard was unable to stay ahead, letting Penn sink three from deep to hold an edge, 30-22. The Crimson rallied for nine more points in the next three and a half minutes and went into the locker room down by three, 34-31.While Harvard out-rebounded the Quakers, 43-34, the team struggled to keep its hands on the ball, turning it over 17 times and yielding 26 points off these errors.“We shouldn’t have 17 turnovers at this point in the season,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s something that we have to figure out how to control better. Seventeen isn’t awful but I really feel we’re a good enough team to have under 15. They’re a very physical team. We were supposed to be ready for that but I think the physicality bothered us a little bit in the first half.”—Staff writer Cordelia F. Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu.

Opening in Agassiz Theatre tonight, “Yes or No?” promises to be a provocative performance. Sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Harvard College Women’s Center, “Yes or No?” invites the audience to transcend passive spectatorship and engage with the show itself. The performance is experimental in its structure and does not have a traditional script—instead, it is a collection of different social experiences at Harvard, each presented in a slightly different way. <p style=""display: inline !important;"">“There isn’t one clear answer to sexual assault at Harvard or one clear experience of it,” facilitator Bex H. Kwan ’14 says. “[That’s] why the show is called ‘Yes or No?’”<p style=""display: inline !important;""><p style=""display: inline !important;"">&nbsp;
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">OSAPR traditionally organizes a performance every February. Last year, the organization sponsored the play “The Vagina Monologues,” but this year Kwan wanted to collaborate with OSAPR to create a show that gives voice to students challenging social expectations at Harvard.<p style=""display: inline !important;""> <p style=""display: inline !important;""> <p style=""display: inline !important;"">“In the fall there was a lot of energy around sexual assault in general,” Kwan says. In continuation of this conversation, the performance encourages dialogue but does not center on conveying a specific message. Rather, its ambiguity is meant to ask the audience members to consider their feelings about the social scene at Harvard. “It isn’t linear in any way. I think every audience that enters will have a different experience of the show,” Kwan says.<p style=""display: inline !important;""> <p style=""display: inline !important;""> <p style=""display: inline !important;"">The show uses a variety of different art forms and draws on the collaborators’ diverse talents. “It’s very interdisciplinary; there’s dance, poetry, singing, theater,” collaborator Braden M. Thue ’16 says.<p style=""display: inline !important;""> <p style=""display: inline !important;""> <p style=""display: inline !important;"">“You will not only be an audience member.... we are inviting you to share a space with us,” says collaborator Cassandra E. Euphrat-Weston ’14. Though the material is rather unconventional, Kwan encourages any student to come see the show and engage in the vital conversation about attitudes towards sex, gender, rape, expectations, and relationships at Harvard.

Early in “Wonderful, Glorious,” Eels’ 10th album, Mark Oliver Everett delivers a statement of intent. “I’m feeling kinda fuzzy / But the future looks bright / Don’t mess with me, I’m up for the fight,” he sings. Eels are, or at any rate used to be, the archetypal 90s indie band: lo-fi, idiosyncratic, and invariably ironic. Eels were representative of an era dominated by professional ironists like Pavement. Now, in their third decade, they find themselves in a musical universe in which earnestness, as practiced by Arcade Fire or Bon Iver, has replaced sardonicism as the currency of indie. As this album shows, Eels have changed with the scene, but with mixed results.Everett, better known as E (or Mr. E), has always been Eels’ driving force, to the extent that the band is best understood as E and his rotating supporting cast. Musically, E used to specialize in deceptively bouncy pop songs with sunny melodies and sardonic lyrics, as displayed on 1996’s “Novocaine for the Soul” and 2005’s “Hey Man (Now You’re Really Living).” On “Wonderful, Glorious,” however, this type of song is notably absent. Instead, the band alternates between tuneless but insistent three-cord hard rockers and mournful, dirge-like ballads. Eels’ music has never been more guitar-driven, and it has never been more repetitive. With the exception of the bridge on “Peach Blossom,” E’s piano—so crucial to earlier classics like “Beautiful Freak” and “It’s a Motherfucker”—makes few appearances. P-Boo, guitarist on Eels’ 2008-2009 concept album trilogy, returns here, and his riffs and solos tend to consist of a few furiously hammered notes that lack both variety and character.Curiously, Eels’ evolution from lo-fi pop to dull hard rock is accompanied by the least depressive lyrics E has ever penned. On past albums, optimism was usually a cover for despair; when E sang, “Goddamn right it’s a beautiful day,” on 2000’s “Mr. E’s Beautiful Blues,” the irony was palpable. Here, the lyrics are as earnest as anything Win Butler or even Chris Martin could pen. At times they can sound quite unrecognizable, as on “You’re My Friend.” “You’re my friend / You done a lot of things for me / And I won’t forget them / Do you know how much you mean to me,” E sings, with not a trace of irony or self-consciousness anywhere. It is jarring to witness a lyricist who was so once so mordantly inventive reduced to writing such pap. Even worse is how easily he resorts to cliché. From “It’s a tangled cobweb that I weave” on “Kinda Fuzzy” to “You always find a way to come through in the clutch” on “You’re My Friend,” this album is full of egregiously lazy imagery; all this from a singer/songwriter whose historic strength has been his lyrics.One aspect of Eels’ evolution is unambiguously positive. In their late 90s and early 2000s heyday, E was at best an indifferent singer. As he has aged, however, his voice has deepened into a smoky half-growl—a sort of indie Rod Stewart—and he is a richer and more expressive vocalist for it. One of the album’s finest moments is “On the Ropes”—a laid-back, folksy reflection on E’s place in the world as he enters middle age. The track is evidence of what “Wonderful, Glorious” could have been: it combines Eels’ traditional strengths—a genuinely attractive melody, and elegant lyrics—with E’s newly optimistic spirit and improved vocals. “I’ve got enough left inside this tired heart / To win this world and walk on my feet,” he sings. For a brief moment it is impossible not to be moved by his spirit.Yet while “On the Ropes” is something of an aberration, it is worth remembering that Eels have always been a singles band and that even their best albums, such as 2000’s “Daisies of the Galaxy,” had plenty of filler. “Wonderful, Glorious” has three tracks that, in different ways, live up to the band’s best work: “On the Ropes,” “Peach Blossom,” and the title track, all of which succeed because of their musical variety. P-Boo’s plodding guitar is accompanied by E’s piano on “Peach Blossom,” while the last 90 seconds of “Wonderful, Glorious” are the best thing on the album. The song, and thus the album, culminates in a majestic combination of strings and synths as E delivers his most forceful, assertive lyrics yet: “My love is beautiful, it’s here for the taking / It’s strong and pure and utterly earth-shaking.” The newfound hope and optimism in E’s lyrics requires a musical counterpoint with vivacity and variance to complement it. The song “Wonderful, Glorious” shows that E still has plenty to offer as singer, songwriter, and bandleader, even if the album as a whole is a poor reflection of his talents.

Ash Wednesday has come and gone, but it's not too late to participate in Lent, a Christian tradition wherein observers give up a luxury for the 40 days leading up to Easter Sunday.Even though Lent is Christian, and it's already started, the principle of ""you don’t know what you have until it's gone"" is still in place, and most Harvard students could benefit from a greater sense of appreciation—or fewer Sunday Sundaes—in their lives. For those looking to get into the spirit of Lent, here are some suggestions of sacrificial offerings, ranked by difficulty.<!--more-->Harvard gear. On those cold and overcast days, nothing seems more comfortable a pair of Harvard sweats or a Harvard pullover to get you through your classes—you don't have think about you're going to wear, and it says ""Harvard"" on it, so really you're just showing school spirit, right? Wrong. We all know that you're just relying on the Harvard brand, and when that happens, we become <a href=""http://www.quickmeme.com/Harvard-Douchebag/?upcoming"">this. So just don't.HBOGO.

So do yourself a favor, and open a textbook instead of HBO.HUDS Desserts. We're talking about the apple crisp, the double chocolate chip cookies, the pecan pie, and—you know this one was coming—Sunday Sundaes. This is going to be a hard one, especially if HUDS is also serving some form of tilapia or sole the same day, but if you truly love thyself, you should shy away.
Drunk eating. For some inexplicable and frustrating reason, when it's 2 a.m. on a Saturday night, there's nothing more satisfying than an Insomnia cookie, or a Felipe's quesadilla. If you do give this up, just know that while it may be incredibly upsetting to watch your friends scarf down slices from Noch's, some people are actually giving up their smartphones for Lent. Can you even imagine? So clutch your phone closer and ignore the smell of pizza—you're going to get through this.Coffee. For you ambitious ones skipping to the bottom of the list, this is only to be attempted by the bravest souls. No coffee means no caffeine, which means that you'll be tired during the day, tired in Lamont, tired during your meetings—giving up coffee is going to involve a fundamental change in the way you work and sleep. You have been warned.

With just over one minute to play in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s contest against Princeton, sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi corralled from freshman Siyani Chambers and slammed the ball home. And though the sizable crowd at Lavietes Pavilion got to its feet on the play, the dunk—the sophomore’s second of the night—served largely as an exclamation point, pushing his team’s lead to a comfortable 13 points.On the penultimate possession of the game, Princeton guard TJ Bray got to the line after collecting his own rebound. But his 1-of-2 effort from the stripe was for naught—the game was already over.The Crimson (15-7, 7-1 Ivy) worked the ball down the court one last time as the clock expired. And with that, Harvard had outlasted its biggest Ivy competition, 69-57, in front of a packed crowd on Saturday evening.“I think we had a hunger here [Saturday] that really started for us [Friday against Penn],” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was anxious to see how we could turn it back around and continue that.”Just 30 seconds into the second half, sophomore Kenyatta Smith converted a layup to stretch his team’s slim lead to six. Though Princeton (12-9, 5-2) held as much as a four-point advantage in a first half that featured 12 lead changes, that was as close as the Tigers would come for the remainder of the game.
Just 8:06 later, a Crimson squad that trailed the Tigers for a solid portion of the first half was up 11 after sophomore Wesley Saunders finished an and-one opportunity.After Princeton threatened to come back, shrinking the scoring gap to six points off two Denton Koon free throws and a three-point play from Will Barrett, Smith converted a shot from inside with 8:52 to play. One block and 22 seconds later, Smith found his way to the free-throw line, where his two made shots boosted his team’s lead to 10.From there, the game returned to the back-and-forth nature of the first half once again. But the Crimson was able to maintain its comfortable advantage.After 20 minutes of play, the Crimson held a slim 32-28 advantage over the only other Ancient Eight team that entered the weekend with a single tally in the loss column.“We liked what we were doing in the first half and we weren’t trying to change [in the second half],” Amaker said. “We needed to do a better job defending the three-point line. They had a couple in the first half and we were not happy with the ones they got. I thought we did that in a terrific way.”Although the Tigers led by as many as four points with 11:25 remaining in the half, everything was all tied up with 2:31 to go after freshman point guard Siyani Chambers converted a jumper.With just under two minutes to play in the opening frame, Saunders stole the ball and pushed it up the court. And although classmate Steve Moundou-Missi—who tallied a team-high eight points on the half, including a monster dunk over Princeton forward Ian Hummer with with 7:56 to go—missed his attempt from midrange, the Crimson found itself with the ball once again in the ensuing scramble.After another Harvard miss—this time from Saunders—Chambers collected the rebound and found co-captain Laurent Rivard, who knocked down a wide-open three point attempt to secure his first points of the game and put his team up, 29-26.And although Princeton’s Hans Brase dunked the ball on the other end, Harvard was able to hold onto its lead.In the final four seconds of the period, Rivard attempted two more threes. Princeton forward Ian Hummer blocked the first, but Rivard collected the rebound and finished his third look from deep at the buzzer.Smith and Moundou-Missi led the Crimson with 14 points, while Hummer paced the Tigers with a game-high 18.“I’m a sixth man,” Moundou-Missi said. “I come off the bench looking to rebound the ball and put my team in a good position to win the game.”With the victory, Harvard remains atop the Ivy standings as the lone Ancient Eight squad with just one loss.“Our league is very tough and challenging and it has been for my tenure at Harvard, and I have said that every time,” Amaker said. “I’m glad our league is recognized as such.”—Staff writer Catherine E.

With a historic win against Princeton two weekends ago in the books, the No. 16 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had just one dual meet left on its schedule. Having taken down all other opponents, the Crimson (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) had its eyes set on an undefeated dual meet season. All that stood in the way was one last matchup against conference foe Penn.“That [win against Princeton] was huge for us,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “We had never beaten Princeton in their home pool before, so we had a tremendous amount of momentum coming off of that. Everyone was really excited to get back to the pool.”Harvard would have to wait an extra week to face off against the Quakers due to weather conditions that made travel near impossible last weekend. But it was business as usual for the Crimson, who took down Penn, 195-98, to conclude its perfect season.“For this meet, more so than in the past, [we] were orienting ourselves for our championships meets at the end of the season,” fellow co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “Today was really about toughness and competing and staying aggressive. We did that.”Harvard got off to a hot start, as sophomore Chuck Katis and juniors Jack Pretto, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite combined for a time of 1:30.66 to win the 200 medley relay. Lee went on to pick up a victory in the 100 butterfly later that afternoon.
The Crimson picked up wins in the next three straight events. Sophomore Mike Gaudiani finished with a time of 9:23.61 to claim a victory in the 1000 freestyle. Roop edged out teammates freshman Ty Rocca and senior Ryan Cutter for a 1-2-3 finish for Harvard in the 200 freestyle. Pretto hit the wall in a time of 50.24 for a win in the 100 backstroke.The Crimson concluded with wins in eight of the final 12 events, for a total of 12 victories on the day. Freshman Christian Carbone and classmate Christian Yeager won the 200 butterfly and the 200 backstroke, respectively, and junior Danny Crigler picked up a win in the 50 free. Crigler also finished second to sophomore Griffin Schumacher in the 100 free. Roop rounded out the top three in the event for another 1-2-3 finish for Harvard.The Crimson also swept the podium in the 500 free. Satterthwaite finished in a time of 4:36.23 to take top honors, closely followed by Gaudiani and fellow sophomore John Bailey. The trio finished within three seconds of each other and over eight seconds ahead of their next nearest competitor.Sophomore Michael Mosca claimed top honors in both of the meet’s diving events, taking home first in the three meter and one meter contests. Harvard claimed the top four spots in both events.The win on Senior Day capped the Crimson’s second undefeated season in the past three years.“It was a little bit surreal, after the meet when I realized it was the last time I would ever swim a meet in our home pool,” Roop said. “But it was so sweet going out knowing you had beaten everyone in the league.”In addition to being Senior Day, another added focus for the day’s events was on the team’s “Ironman” challenge.“We have a tradition on the team every year where the freshman who best exudes the qualities that characterize HMSD is elected Ironman for his class,” Wurzbacher said. “He is required to swim in every single heat of every single event. It’s a really challenging individual thing to do. One of the most fun parts of the season is being out there, supporting him through that.”This year, freshman Jacob Luna was elected the honors for the Class of 2016. In addition, Katis, a sophomore, competed in all the day’s swimming events as well. Katis, who has already qualified for this year’s NCAA Championships, was unable to complete his Ironman last year due to scheduling issues.Now with its dual meet schedule concluded, Harvard has its eyes set solely on its championship meets in the coming weeks. The Crimson’s main goal for the entire season has been reclaiming the Ivy League title from No. 20 Princeton.“The best perspective we can have is to view ourselves as underdogs,” Wurzbacher said. “The facts are that Princeton has won the Ivy League Championship every single one of the past four years. Princeton’s the favorite. They’ve won four years in a row. But we’re going in to upset them.”In total, the Crimson earned first place in 12 of the day’s 16 events.—Staff Writer Brenna R.

The Harvard men’s tennis team earned a third-place finish in the ECAC Men’s Indoor Tennis Championship on Sunday with a 4-3 victory over Princeton (3-3) at the Reis Tennis Center. The team bounced back from Saturday’s 4-2 defeat in the semifinals to its hosts, Cornell. The Big Red upset second-seeded Columbia on Sunday to win the tournament in front of its home crowd in Ithaca, N.Y.The Crimson (6-4) entered the tournament as the first seed and took down rival Yale, 4-2, on Friday but ran out of gas against Cornell. According to head coach Dave Fish, the team was still very happy with its performance this weekend after the rebound against the Tigers, especially given the circumstances.“We are still hoping that we can get our whole squad back and assembled,” Fish said. “So I think what we’ve done so far has exceeded our expectations.”HARVARD 4, PRINCETON 3On Sunday, Harvard played without its No. 1 player, sophomore Denis Nguyen, due to injury. Its usual No. 3, sophomore Alex Steinroeder, moved up to the second slot despite having been in the hospital the night before.
Even with the adversity, the rest of the team stepped up and delivered. The match began with singles on Sunday. Sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri, playing at No. 1, went down to Princeton’s Matija Pecotic, the third-ranked player in the country, but junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and freshman Nicky Hu both won to give the Crimson a 2-1 lead.Steinroeder lost a close match, 7-6 (5). 6-4, and freshman Kelvin Lam, stepping in at No. 6, lost in three sets. But co-captain Andy Nguyen tied it at 3-3 after a comeback victory, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, so doubles were necessary to decide the match.In doubles, Andy Nguyen and Hu took an easy win on the first court, 8-3. On the second court, Lam and MacMaster were down a break, 6-5, but broke the Tigers’ serves twice to win 8-6 and give Harvard the 4-3 victory.“It was really just tremendous play,” Fish said. “The tennis quality was so high, and the team just didn’t quit.”CORNELL 4, HARVARD 2On Saturday, both Harvard and the Big Red came into the match hot—each team had won its last three matches—but Cornell was the team that got off to a fast start. MacMaster and Denis Nguyen got an easy 8-2 win in No. 1 doubles, but Steinroeder and Chaudhuri went down 8-5 at No. 3, leaving the doubles point up to Andy Nguyen and Hu.The pair led, 7-6, but eventually lost, 8-7(4), giving the doubles point to Cornell.In singles, the Big Red won three matches in straight sets to gain the victory. At No. 5, Hu went down, 6-2, 6-4; Cornell’s Quoc-Daniel Nguyen took down Andy Nguyen, 7-5. 6-3, on the fourth court; and Denis Nguyen lost, 6-2, 7-5, in the first slot.Chaudhuri gave credit to the Big Red for competing hard.“They played a really good tournament,” Chaudhuri said. “Nobody really expected them to pull it out, but they came prepared and played well the whole weekend, so hats off to them.”

After knocking off No. 9 Penn State Friday night in straight sets, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was riding high heading into Saturday’s matchup against St Francis. And despite some early hiccups, the Crimson was able to cap off one of the greatest weekends in program history with its second straight-set conference victory in as many days against the Red Flash at the Malkin Athletic Center.After the team’s first-ever win over the Nittany Lions and an earlier 3-0 defeat of St. Francis on Jan 25th, Harvard (7-2, 3-1 EIVA) entered the game as heavy favorites against its conference rivals. But stretches of sloppy play combined with strong pressure from the Red Flash (5-9, 2-3 EIVA) made life difficult for the home team, which required some late rallies to secure the match.“We definitely did not play our best,” said junior libero Chris Gibbons, who led his team with 11 digs. “We knew it would be tough coming off such a high-adrenaline win [against Penn State]… and come back and focus on St. Francis.”Harvard coach Brian Baise acknowledged that his team struggled dealing with the emotional effect of the Penn State win.“We know that to compete at this level and reach the goals that we have, we have got to be able to play Friday-Saturday matches,” Baise said. “We have to be in shape enough to and strong enough mentally to play hard.”
St. Francis did not appear intimidated early in the contest, and Harvard struggled to control its energy as the Red Flash stormed out to a 10-6 lead. The Crimson began to edge its way back into the game behind several attack errors and kills from junior outside hitters Nick Madden and Kyle Rehkemper, taking a 19-17 lead and forcing a St. Francis timeout. But the stoppage did not halt the Crimson’s momentum, as the squad held its lead for a 25-23 win.Baise credited St. Francis’ strong play to a solid service game and blocking that knocked Harvard out of its offensive rhythm.“We were not quite as sharp, but mentally we hung in there and the guys got the point when we needed them,” Baise said. “We were in sync in stretches, and we had to fight and labor a little bit to get through.”Gibbons also nodded to the Red Flash’s strong play, but acknowledged that his team did not make the match easy.“[We had] mistakes coming on our side–whether it was passing, defense, or hitting,” Gibbons said. “We had to clean up a few things on our side where we were making errors.”The second set was a frame of runs for both teams, as they exchanged leads early. But some strong blocking from St. Francis gave the team a slight advantage, 17-15, before Baise called a timeout. The Red Flash continued to hold its ground, extending its lead to 21-18.But some strong defensive play from the home side, anchored by Gibbons, kept several strong hits from St. Francis alive and allowed the Crimson to cash in some chances. The service and offensive passing began to warm up, as well. Sophomore DJ White notched five of his team-high 12 kills after the Harvard timeout. As Harvard seemed to look more like the team it was on Friday night, the Crimson was able to march on a seven-point run to close out the second frame, 25-21.The momentum continued for Harvard, as the Crimson raced out to an 8-4 lead to begin the third frame. More attack errors from the Red Flash put the visitors in a deeper hole at 13-7.But, as it did all night, the Red Flash persisted. After applying some offensive pressure, St. Francis was able to pull within two, 22-20, before Baise called a timeout to settle his squad’s nerves.The tactic worked, as Harvard and the Red Flash traded points, pushing on to a 25-22 victory for the Crimson.After not dropping a set all weekend and taking a 3-1 record away from its two Pennsylvania rivals on the season, Gibbons feels his team is ready to handle any competition left in the coming months.“There are a lot of good teams left to play in our league,” Gibbons said. “We know that we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but this weekend was a good confidence booster. [Friday night] was probably the best volleyball we’ve played all season, so we are very confident going forward.”–Staff writer Peter G. Cornick can be reached at pcornick@college.harvard.edu

Though rich in layers of sound, Frightened Rabbit’s new album, “Pedestrian Verse,” conveys a sweeping sense of emptiness. The first track, “Acts of Man,” opens with piano chords: a simple group of notes that is progressively covered by waves of new sound. Vocals arrive first, followed by a silky, electric hum similar in timbre to violins. The next instruments to join the building music are hollow drums, then an insistent electric guitar melody, and finally, more voices join the first. By the end of “Acts of Man,” and for the rest of the album, the themes of vulnerable loneliness disappear into compensating layers of sound. Frightened Rabbit is preoccupied with filling the vacant spaces in life with wandering, enveloping noise; this artistic obsession with emotional and musical voids is verbalized in  lead singer and lyricist Scott Hutchinson’s verse on “Holy,” “You’re acting all holy / when you know I’m full of holes.”“Pedestrian Verse,” the band’s fourth album, stands as the group’s best effort to date, bolstered by richer lyrics and more varied instrumentation than previous work. Although the intertwining layers of sound are not new for Frightened Rabbit, the more melancholy subject matter and minor-key melodies on most of the tracks are more present in this album than in any of their previous records. The upbeat, almost teasing prologues to each track that can be found on previous albums, like “State Hospital” or “Winter of Mixed Drinks,” are missing from “Pedestrian Verse”—instead, most songs start with a few spare, sorrowful beats. Whereas the gradual layering of sound acts as a means of building momentum in Frightened Rabbit’s earlier albums, in “Pedestrian Verse,” the addition of sound seems an effort to overwhelm the loneliness and fill some musical or emotional void.Frightened Rabbit, who hail from Selkirk, Scotland, draw much of their lyrical and musical inspiration from Scottish heritage and landscape. The five band members sing through Scottish accents and make reference to Viking origins through refrains of torches, skulls buried underneath “the paving stones,” and drunken priests. The layered quality of their sound recalls the bagpipe, which emits a dull buzzing underneath the higher, louder melody, a subtle layer that is present in most of Frightened Rabbit’s songs. Even when they are not making direct reference to the island, Frightened Rabbit’s lyrical mood is as overcast as the Scottish weather, an ambiance made apparent in the line, “The candle is blown, we start the black march home / Through a stale and silent night.”Though the instrumentation is fresh and varied in texture, Hutchinson writes mainly about feeling alone and inadequate. His lyrics—many of which confess a desire for sleep and describe paranoid insecurities—sound all the more stark against the foil of the lush music which backs them. In many of the songs, a chorus takes over from Hutchinson, helping him towards the height of the track. The multitude of voices are a comforting contrast to the often lonely sound of Hutchinson’s vocals.At times, these voices seem to back up the emotions of one of the performers. When Hutchinson sings, “Please don’t steal me from my house,” the voices that rise to accompany him enforce his protest. It seems that the whole album is a defense in some way: the performers intend to speak for all those who have ever felt alone. Indeed, this is such a salient theme throughout the album that there are two songs with the refrain, “You can’t carry me away now / Please don’t steal me from my house,”—the first titled “Housing (In)” and the reprise, three songs later, titled “Housing (Out).” Both songs are similar in their chorus and tempo, but the second is shorter and ends more abruptly. The two similar songs spaced between other tracks on the album contribute to its overall symmetry. When the same lyrics and melody return, it is as if the performers are returning to an unfinished thought.
“Housing (Out)” leads into the final song on the album, “Oil Slick”—a surprisingly hopeful song that seems to recall the recent BP oil spill as Hutchinson sings, “Sound like an oil slick coating the wings we’ve grown.” Frightened Rabbit leave the album with soft bird calls as an answer to the solitary feeling that dominated the beginning of the album, when the single voice and spare instrumentals left a lot of musical territory empty—they open the insular, claustrophobic emotions of the performers to outside noise at last.—Staff writer Virginia R.

“Bitches Love Me (ft. Drake and Future)”Lil Wayne, ""I Am Not A Human Being II""“I’m on that good kush and alcohol / I got some down bitches I can call,” murmurs Future at the opening of Lil Wayne’s newest single, “Bitches Love Me.” The song—with its abundant profanity and references to weed, booze, and, of course, bitches—will, when played on the radio, have almost as many words edited out as left intact. As such, it stands a fair chance of being 2013’s “Young, Wild &amp; Free,” a similarly irreverent hit. And yet, it is Future and Drake’s infectious and profane chorus that carries the song, while Lil’ Wayne’s two verses fall flat. His lyrics meander aimlessly, and his rhymes lack creativity, moving from “Now kiss my ass if you hating” to “I’m getting ass while I’m skating.” With this track, Wayne truly seems to be riding on the popularity of his protege Drake, whose fame and talent have eclipsed Weezy’s own.“YOLO (ft. Adam Levine and Kendrick Lamar)”The Lonely Island
Although the concept of YOLO has been incessantly mocked since its arrival on the pop culture scene, The Lonely Island manages to revive the humor of a stale joke with off-kilter and overly cautious advice on how listeners may prolong their lives. Among other recommendations, the boys counsel their audience to “stay the hell away from drugs / Cause they’re not legal / Then bury all your money in the backyard / Like a beagle.” However, while Levine’s soaring chorus makes the song eminently more catchy, Lamar’s verse, filled with awkward financial advice, clashes with the song’s comedy. With its quirky lyrics and pop artist cameos, “YOLO” follows the group’s standard format but doesn’t push the limits of comedy as far as some of the trio’s previous songs. Rather, the group seems to be following its own advice: you only live once, so why take any chances?“One Way Trigger”The Strokes, “Comedown Machine”The Strokes recently released the first single from their eagerly awaited upcoming album, and this first taste of “Comedown Machine” does not disappoint. “One Way Trigger” begins with a staccato synthpop beat and a falsetto mumble uncharacteristic of frontman Julian Casablancas. As the guitar kicks in, Casablancas’s voice drops to his standard coarse murmur but continues to oscillate between the two registers for the remainder of the song. The highly danceable track is perhaps more reminiscent of Casablancas’s 2009 solo album “Phrazes for the Young” than a typical Strokes album, but the guitar solo in the middle harkS back to The Strokes at their best. “One Way Trigger” promises exciting new work from The Strokes.

""I'm too busy"" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).Getting an authentic taste of Asia in America is a challenge, especially for someone who has lived in an Asian country for most of her life. Takemura, a Japanese-Korean restaurant in Harvard Square, still has some ""Americanized"" flavors, but it does accomplish the task of satisfying people's cravings for ethnic cuisine.<!--more-->For an appetizer, Kabocha Nimono ($5.95), or boiled Japanese pumpkin, arouses an appetite for sweet and savory flavors. The naturally sweet pumpkin, diced into three large chunks, is soaked in a slightly watered-down soy sauce.The Spicy Rainbow Roll ($10.95) is sliced into eight bite-sized pieces. The roll has tuna and salmon on top with white fish and spicy tuna inside. It is certainly not a dish suitable for those who feel squeamish consuming raw fish.Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap ($15.95), one of Korea's most traditional meals, was a huge disappointment. The dish was supposed to be served in a sizzling stone pot, but instead it came in a lukewarm bowl. The balance between the amount of vegetables and the rice underneath was a bit skewed.

If Boston needed a little post-holiday pick-me-up to brighten spirits before the snowstorm, it is hard to imagine a much better stress-reducer than the concert held last Tuesday night at TD Garden featuring Mumford &amp; Sons, Ben Howard, and The Felice Brothers. In the debut performance of the Sons’ current U.S. tour, the three groups convened in what seemed an all-male family gathering in which they impressed with the folksy combination of their heartfelt lyrics and earthy instrumentals.The first opener, Ben Howard, assumed the role of the cool older cousin. Howard was always careful to use his indoor voice, giving his performance the feel of an intimate living room set. Unfortunately, the massive TD Garden was half empty at the beginning of the concert, so the chatter of fans still trickling in detracted slightly from Howard’s indrawn performance.The set list was short and sweet—perhaps a bit too short—and included lesser-known songs in addition to favorites like “Only Love” from Howard’s first album. Howard was unafraid to wander from the original recorded versions of his songs, easily lengthening chords and drawing out passages in a way that demonstrated his musical prowess. Sitting down with his guitar, he filled the space with his enveloping sound in a way that was simultaneously comforting and melancholy, like wrapping up in a wool blanket on a blustery day.Later on, even Marcus Mumford of Mumford &amp; Sons commented on Howard’s remarkably tranquil vibe. In between songs, Mumford complained facetiously to the audience about having to share the stage with Howard—“He’s like the nicest guy you’ll ever meet, and it just pisses you off.”The Felice Brothers provided a more upbeat transition into the main act, although they sometimes came across like the less mature, younger siblings. Though the band moved between upbeat and downtempo songs, their Bob Dylan reminiscent ballads were all too predictable and their instrumentals did not pack the same kind of focused energy as those of either the Sons or Howard.
Decidedly not a rock band, the group seemed eager to shed its New York roots in favor of Midwestern twang, with song titles like “Whisky in my Whisky” and the occasional sung “sha-na-ny-na” piling country flair onto their washboard instrumentals. Nevertheless, the Felice Brothers seemed confused about their own identity, with two band members wearing skinny jeans and the rest Levi’s. Although the beat of their songs was often too messy to easily sway along with, their happiness felt authentic, and the band members seemed genuinely pleased to be up on stage—qualities all three acts had in common.After much anticipation, the curtain went up and the show went down. Whereas Howard’s set was reserved and the Felice Brothers’ sounded like a roughly-cut hodgepodge of folkish ditties, Mumford &amp; Sons came onto the stage with all of the finesse and presence of a seasoned father figure, stomping and swaying in their collared shirts with an air that said, “yes, we are what you have been waiting for.” And for all of the hype surrounding their latest album and speculation over whether the band can forever live up to its self-proclaimed “unashamed” sound, the Sons indisputably delivered.From the first chord of their opening number, “Babel,” the crowd was hooked. Mumford &amp; Sons played each note with the well-rehearsed vision that has earned them their international rock-star status. It took nearly an orchestra of musicians to produce the kind of sound in the incredibly polished “Winter Winds,” but whether the four men were playing by themselves or surrounded by trumpet players, there was nothing uncertain about the way they performed; their lyrics saturated with emotion and instruments working as hard as the light crew, Mumford &amp; Sons gave clearly more of a show than the other two acts. This seemed to be just fine with the audience, who at times raised their palms to the sky in mock religious observation.Speaking to Mumford &amp; Sons’ widespread appeal--middle-aged fans outnumbered teenagers by far (perhaps due to the steep price of tickets) and seemed just as enthused as their younger counterparts. Sweatshirts and baseball caps abounded, although the concert did draw the occasional hipster.One of the band’s biggest criticisms is that all of its songs sound the same, but while Marcus Mumford’s now iconic croon powered each song, the set list packed enough energy to never seem repetitive and demonstrated considerable variety of chord progression and tempo, contributing to a show that had just the right amount of ebb and flow. Opening crowd-pleasers like “Little Lion Man” and “I Will Wait” built up a mood of enthusiasm that lasted throughout the night, even for less sensationalized numbers.Mumford &amp; Sons has excellence down to a science. They know how to please a crowd, how to throw themselves into their songs as though performing for the first time, and it makes for a fantastic concert. With sweat dripping from their once-coiffed hair, they finished the show by suddenly emerging on a different stage for the encore. Singing a cappella, the men ended on a more subdued note by performing a few gentler numbers, but not before imploring the crowd to be “really fucking quiet,” which naturally lasted all of thirty seconds.Between the bittersweet melodies of Ben Howard and the infectious energy of Mumford &amp; Sons, the concert was accessible while still showcasing ample artistic talent. Perhaps because they play instruments like banjos and acoustic guitars, all three groups performed the kind of music best seen live, and their distinct styles complemented each other nicely. As such, it was a uniquely moving concert, marked by the passion of the performers and the delight of the audience.

On a night when most of the Ivy basketball world was looking ahead to Saturday, the Harvard men’s basketball team made sure it took care of business at home on Friday night first.The Crimson (14-7, 6-1 Ivy) cruised to an easy victory over Penn (5-18, 2-4) at Lavietes Pavilion—its first stress-free win of conference play thus far—to set up a much-anticipated contest against Princeton on Saturday that will place one of those two teams alone atop Ivy standings midway through the conference season.To get to that point unscathed, Harvard was led by an unlikely hero. Making his first start since a Nov. 27 loss to Vermont, sophomore center Kenyatta Smith turned in a career night, registering 20 points, 10 blocks—a program record—and nine rebounds.“I was a little nervous, having not started since the beginning of the season,” Smith said. “Ever since [finding out], I’ve just been trying to calm myself down, just focus on playing my game.”After Smith only registered an average of 7.5 minutes in the 15 contests between his November benching and Friday’s contest, Amaker—hoping for more size against the Quakers’ taller big men—surprisingly turned to his largest interior presence to replace the smaller Jonah Travis at the five.
“I mentioned to Jonah that we weren’t down on him,” Amaker said. “We just felt this was a moment we needed to make an adjustment and see where it would take us.”What the coach never could have expected was that his decision would result in the performance turned in by Smith, who was seven-of-eight from the field in 31 minutes.“He was really brilliant when it came to making shots,” Amaker said. “Inside-out is how we always want to play, and we haven’t been able to do that as well [this season].... Hopefully Kenyatta’s going to be the answer for that as we continue to move forward.”Along with sophomore wing Wesley Saunders—who had a game-high 23 points Friday—Smith was the significant piece of Amaker’s recruiting class of 2015. Named the 13th best center in the country by Rivals, Smith chose the Crimson over fellow finalists Vanderbilt and Penn.After struggling to get off the bench behind Kyle Casey and Keith Wright ’12 as a rookie and losing his starting job early this season, it took a match-up with the Quakers, a team he turned down, for Smith to finally be the player Amaker hoped he could be.“I said to him, ‘This is why you’re here,’” Amaker said. “It was time for him step forward in this program. We needed him to give us what we recruited him to do.”“[Amaker] had a lot of faith in me,” Smith added. “He told me he was counting on me and I didn’t want to let him down. I didn’t want to let the team down.”With 1:59 left in the blowout, the coach decided to pull his starters, including his center, who exited just shy of a triple-double.“You have to have a post presence,” Amaker said. “He’s our best option when it comes to that, and I was incredibly impressed with the way he handled it tonight.”CARTWRIGHT CONTAINED

When Princeton came into Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night, the game not only featured a matchup of the two top teams in the league, but also the conference’s two top players—Harvard’s Wesley Saunders and the Tigers’ Ian Hummer.Entering the weekend’s contests, the Ivies were led in scoring by those two, with the former holding a 1.4-point advantage at 17.0 points per game. And while Saunders, a sophomore, is ranked fourth in conference in field goal percentage, Hummer, a senior, trails him at the number five position. The two are separated by only one other player in assists per game as well, and have comparable statistics in many other categories.So, on Saturday, when their two squads stepped on the floor, it was no surprise to see Saunders match up against Hummer on the first possession of the evening.The first two interactions between the two seemed to illustrate their close standing, as Saunders first forced a Hummer turnover and Hummer returned the favor with a made jump shot the next time he touched the ball.“Hummer is a nightmare of a matchup and a warrior…. He is a very tough guy to guard,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s physical; he’s always on the move. He’s very active. You can’t let your guard down for one second on the defensive end. Wesley did as well as anyone could do.”
Following a Princeton adjustment that placed Hummer further inside, a strategy that took advantage of his size relative to Saunders, the latter was moved off of the bigger Hummer, and the assignment was given instead to Crimson bigs, namely sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi.Hummer ended up with 18 points and seven rebounds on the night, shooting 7-of-14 from the field and four-of-four from the charity stripe. Saunders notched 11 points, only two-thirds of his normal output, but tallied five assists along with two steals.TWO BIGS/TOO BIGWith 7:16 remaining in the second half, an unusual lineup appeared for Harvard. After Saunders picked up his fourth foul, he was subbed out in favor of Mondou-Missi. With sophomore big Kenyatta Smith already on the court, the Crimson then featured a lineup with two players who log time at the center position.“Different guys have been able to step in and step forward,” said Amaker, referring to his team’s adaptation to this lineup. “It’s been a good calling card for this group…. We thought we could get [Saunders] out and preserve that last foul as long as we could. Our kids did a good job of playing without [him].”The two-big lineup lasted a total of three minutes and 36 seconds, during which time Harvard went on a 10-4 run to take a double-digit lead, 62-48. Mondou-Missi and Smith combined for half of those Crimson points, five of their total 28 points for the game. The two amassed seven rebounds apiece, and Smith collected six blocks.“I’ve mentioned to our players that Kenyatta was ready for an opportunity, and he embraced it…” Amaker explained. “[And] Steve, his energy and effort off the bench, he’s a sixth starter and has been sacrificing himself to do whatever we need for our team.”Saturday night’s game marked the second consecutive start for Smith, over which period he has shot 94.5 percent from the field, put up 34 points, and swatted 16 blocks.“I always knew he was a great player,” Mondou-Missi said of Smith. “I always believed in him, the team believed in him, Coach believed in him. He’s done a great job…. He’s a great player, [and] he’s shown it the last two games.”CHARITY GIVINGIn a game that often comes down to inches, the measurement of 15-feet was more important for Harvard against the Tigers. For the first 33 minutes and seven seconds of the night, the Crimson did not miss a single shot from the free throw line, going a perfect eight-for-eight thanks to shots from both Smith and Saunders. While Mondou-Missi eventually broke the streak, his four-for-six from the charity stripe was almost 10 percent better than his in-conference average for the season.The importance of free throws down the stretch was accentuated by several late Harvard mistakes—in the final 8:30 of the contest, Harvard hit eight out of 10 of its free takes, while turning the ball over four times.And, when Princeton employed a strategy of intentionally fouling Mondou-Missi, hitting from the charity stripe became the Crimson’s only offensive option. Fortunately for Harvard, it ended the game shooting 16-of-18 from the line, good for 88.9 percent—its best performance thus far in Ivy play.—Staff Writer Juliet Spies-Gans can be reached at jspiesgans@college.harvard.edu.

In a battle for late-season momentum, the Harvard men’s hockey team skated to a 2-2 draw against historic rival Cornell (9-13-3, 5-10-3) Saturday night at a crowded Bright Hockey Center.Usually one of the most highly touted games of the year, of flying fish and Love Story fame, this contest is rarely one between the bottom-dwellers of the ECAC. But that was the story this year, with the Crimson (7-15-3, 4-12-2 ECAC) sitting in last and the Big Red entering Saturday ahead of Harvard by just three points.Nevertheless, both teams had hopes of building on some recent success to spark a late surge. Cornell had snapped a seven-game losing streak with a win over No. 17 Dartmouth the night before, and the Crimson had snapped a nine-game winless streak earlier in the week in the consolation game of the Beanpot against No. 13 Boston University.The two Ivy League teams traded leads over the first two periods, with the Big Red going ahead 1-0 early in the first and Harvard taking a 2-1 lead in the second, but regulation ended with the teams knotted at two.Despite being outshot, 40-23, the Crimson had several chances to take two points on the night.
With around 20 seconds remaining in regulation, sophomore Tommy O’Regan passed the puck to senior Luke Greiner on a two-on-one. Greiner wristed a one-timer towards the left side of the Cornell net, but Big Red netminder Andy Iles dove to the left and blocked the forward’s shot.The two teams were unable to capitalize in the five-minute overtime period, and each team left the 141st meeting between the two with one point.With four games in the last six days, the Crimson was unable to muster enough energy to win in the end, but finished the weekend with three out of a possible four points.“To me energy wise I thought we ran out of gas,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “A lot of that goes to giving credit to Cornell—I think they did a good job of getting the pucks deep and holding on to it and when we needed it [junior Raphael Girard] came up with some good saves.”Girard finished with 38 saves on the night in front of a crowd filled primarily by Cornell fans.“It’s always nice to kind of silence the crowd a little bit at times,” Girard said.Cornell opened up the scoring early in the first period, with senior Greg Miller scoring on a redirect of a pass from freshman defenseman Reece Wilcox from the left point.Miller, having scored 15 points in his last 16 games, now leads the Big Red in scoring and is aiming to be the first three-time points leader for Cornell since Matt Moulson, who currently plays for the NHL’s New York Islanders.The score remained 1-0 for most of the first before the home team responded with a power-play goal with less than thirty seconds left in the opening frame. assistant captain Alex Fallstrom was able to put a rebound into the net after the Crimson initially won a fight along the boards.The two teams traded goals in the second period, with Harvard first taking the lead with an opportunistic goal.After a lengthy set up by Cornell, captain Nick D’Agostino skated up the left side from behind the Big Red net, tripped and fell, and lost the puck. Harvard freshman Kyle Criscuolo took the puck from the defenseman, skated back towards the Cornell goal, and sent the puck across the left to senior Marshall Everson, who fired the puck past Iles.The Big Red was able to tie the game at two with an even-strength goal by D’Agostino. Freshman forward Joel Lowry cut back along the left side, sent the puck behind the net to teammate Brian Ferlin, who curled back up to the right side of the net and passed the puck to the captain, who one-timed it past Girard.With two more goals tonight, the senior class has scored 11 of the last 13 goals, and entering the game, the Crimson had 11 goals in the previous two games compared to 11 goals in the nine before that.“I think our senior group has really elevated its game,” Donato said. “They are the catalysts for us and with their improved play our power play has become better and they’ve given us a real lift emotionally as well.”—Staff writer David Mazza can be reached at davidmazza@college.harvard.edu.

In front of the crowd at Jadwin Gymnasium, Harvard women’s basketball dropped an early lead to Princeton on Saturday night and fell in the Tigers’ territory for the fourth consecutive year.The home team took advantage of the Crimson’s (13-8, 4-3 Ivy) inability to maintain momentum, which led to Harvard’s second-straight loss of the weekend, 67-51. Suffering from a high number of turnovers, the team could not push past the Tigers and fell to third place in the Ivy League standings behind Princeton (16-5, 7-0) and Penn.“We took great shots and they didn’t fall for us,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t have any criticism for [our team]. I thought we played hard, I thought we played confidently. I guess Princeton, because of their history, has more confidence than we do.”With twelve minutes to go in the first half, the Tigers stepped on the gas to overtake Harvard. Leading the rush, guard Niveen Rasheed broke from Harvard’s defense to capitalize on a fast-break opportunity.  The Crimson then coughed up the ball twice, opening the door for Princeton guards Blake Dietrick and Michelle Miller to sink four treys in quick succession. In a minute and a half, the Tigers went on a 14-2 run that gave them a seven-point lead, one that they would keep for the rest of the game.“There are shifts in momentum in every game,” Delaney-Smith said. “To have a seven point lead, then tie it up, and stay close for a while, that’s normal basketball. I don’t think there was any overwhelming factor [as to] why that happened.”
Harvard turnovers thwarted what should have been strong drives for the team all night. The Crimson lost the ball 23 times, almost twice the number of carries that Princeton surrendered. The team’s twelve fouls further burdened its momentum, undercutting Harvard’s efforts.“Princeton is the best team in the league at capitalizing on mistakes and turning them into baskets,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re really good at capitalizing on turnovers.”The visiting squad stayed on the Tigers’ heels until the end of the first half, cutting Princeton’s lead to four points. With one minute remaining, the Tigers made two free throws and followed up on a turnover for a lay-up, closing out the half eight points up on the Crimson.“We felt we played them well for the most part and discussed adjustments [at halftime that] we needed to make in the second half,” junior guard Christine Clark said. “We were confident if we made those adjustments we would win.”But Harvard continued to forfeit drives to turnovers, recording 10 in the second half while Princeton pulled ahead with consistent scoring. The Crimson found itself trailing by 18 points with seven minutes remaining in the game, its largest deficit. A six-two run begun by sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle with 6:24 remaining allowed Harvard to narrow the Tiger’s lead to 16 points. Christine Clark tallied the final points for the Crimson and the team finished both halves with the same margin of deficit.Harvard took an early lead over Princeton with consistent drives to the net. Clark opened the scoring at the minute mark, followed quickly by a lay-up by senior forward Victoria Lippert, the Crimson’s top scorer for the game. Two more buckets and two free throws gave Harvard a six-point advantage.“We were confident,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we were well prepared. We kept the discipline [after] dropping Penn the night before. I loved how we started, I think we started strong.”The Crimson was in foul trouble all night, notching 20 fouls to send the Tigers to the charity stripe 21 times. Although Harvard went a perfect six for six on free throws, Princeton outdid the Crimson by sheer number of trips to the line.Lippert, Fagbenle, and sophomore forward Erin McDonnell led Harvard offensively, netting 13, 10, and 9 points—McDonnell’s career high—respectively. Rasheed joined Dietrick in double figures, chipping in a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds. Co-captain Miriam Rutzen supported the Crimson with good returns on rebounds, pulling down eight boards.The Tigers won the game on three pointers, an aspect of play that Harvard couldn’t get going. Dietrick went five for nine from downtown, while the Crimson only converted on three of 13 attempts. Despite not starting the game, Dietrick was on the court for 30 minutes and led Princeton scoring with a career high 19 points. Headed by Dietrick, the Tiger bench contributed 35 points to the 19 put up by Harvard’s reserves.

Just over three minutes into the game, the Harvard women’s hockey team had already netted two goals and set the tone for its match against Colgate (9-19-3, 4-13-3 ECAC) Saturday night at Starr Arena. The Crimson (19-4-2, 15-2-1) bounced back from a Friday night loss against league rival Cornell to top the Raiders, 5-2.“I think we had good balance [and] good shots in the net,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They worked hard and created penalties off of speed.”Freshman Mary Parker capitalized on a Colgate cross checking penalty 21 seconds into the contest. The forward’s score was assisted by senior Kaitlin Spurling, who followed up less than two minutes later with a goal of her own.A Raider hooking penalty led to another power play opportunity for Harvard. Spurling found the back of the net off of a rebounding shot from sophomore Michelle Picard. The senior forward has had just two other matches in her career with multiple goals.“The second power play unit has really stepped it up [by] putting pucks in the net,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “And I think it’s just because of us moving the puck really well.”
The first period of play included a Colgate goal from Brittany Phillips, assisted by Megan Wickens. The Crimson suffered two penalties at the end of the frame, but Harvard was able to shut out the Raiders’ power play for the two minutes that stretched into the second stanza.The Crimson widened its lead when sophomore defender Sarah Edney rocketed a puck past Colgate’s rookie goaltender Ashlynne Rando. Spurling notched her second goal of the day minutes later with a pass from sophomore forward Samantha Reber.“One of the key things we wanted to do was get to the net [and] get in the goalie’s face, put pressure on her, [and] create rebounds,” Dempsey said.Harvard more than doubled the number of shots on goal attempted by the Raiders, 35-16.“We have a pretty potent offense and it’s a matter of getting there,” Stone said. “We did a better job of that, getting on the goaltender and taking some shots. We’re trying to improve our game and not [make] too many changes.”The Crimson was called for two consecutive penalties at the end of the second frame, giving Colgate a five-on-three opportunity. The Raiders were able to convert on their final power play, when Katie Case used a rebound to put the puck in the back of the net.Colgate was able to connect on only one of six power play opportunities.Junior Kalley Armstrong potted the last goal of the match off of a feed up the middle from sophomore forward Hillary Crowe, marking Crowe’s fourth consecutive game with a point. Armstrong’s shot brought the final score to 5-2 seven minutes into the third period.“We made [it] a focus right away, to get pucks in the net and get going,” Dempsey said. “ We don’t like losing, and so we had that extra fire going right off the bat.”The Raiders were unable to get any shots off throughout the entire third frame. Co-captain Laura Bellamy produced 15 saves in the game and gained her tenth straight win, bringing the goaltender’s record to 11-1-1 on the season. Bellamy and the rest of Harvard’s seniors have never dropped a game to Colgate throughout their Crimson careers.Harvard is facing its final four regular season conference games at home at Bright Hockey Center. Both Dempsey and Stone have the potential to set personal records in the season’s homestretch. Dempsey remains one point away from breaking into the Crimson’s top 10 career point scorers and Stone needs only three wins to reach the 400 mark of her career.“We’re looking forward to being home,” Stone said. “We’re hoping that we’re going to have a good fan base in the building because we’re certainly going to need it. It feels like we haven’t been home in a long time.”Harvard, which hosts Brown this Tuesday, can earn home ice for the entirety of the ECAC tournament if it wins out.“I can’t believe that it’s already at this point being a senior,” Dempsey said. “I’m looking to just go out there, work extremely hard, make the most of it, and savor these moments.”—Staff Writer Claire K.

Harvard co-captain Steven Keith tallied his 100th career win after a 7-2 decision over Brown’s Cortlandt Choate at the Malkin Athletic Center Saturday afternoon. The senior went undefeated for the day, securing his 101st victory a few hours later against Boston University’s Tyler Scotton. Keith now joins the ranks of teammate and co-captain Walter Peppelman in the 100-win club. Keith’s squad ended up winning both of Saturday’s contests, handily taking care of each opponent.HARVARD 31, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 6Harvard (7-5, 4-4 EIWA) traveled just down the road to take on the Terriers (7-9) after beating Brown on Saturday.Freshman Jeffrey Ott opened the match with a 14-0 major decision, going undefeated for the day. Senior Shay Warren continued the Crimson lead after registering a takedown in overtime, securing a 4-2 decision in the 133 weight class.Keith racked in a third victory for Harvard as well as his 101st career win after defeating his opponent, 4-0.
“Steven went out and did what Steven does,” Peppelman said. “He won a good match against a tough opponent.”Freshman Todd Preston also went undefeated for the day after clinching a close 8-6 victory over Boston University’s Nick Tourville.“Preston really shined and beat a top competitor, a junior who’s been in the lineup for the past two years for BU,” Peppelman said. “Todd stepped it up and won there, and that was really big for Todd and good for the team as well.”At 157, Peppelman pinned his opponent in the opening period. The senior has yet to lose a match in a dual meet this season.“Luckily I was able to secure a pin, which was good for me,” Peppelman said. “It was a personal victory having lost to that guy before, so that was kind of exciting.”The Terriers snagged their first decision in the 165 weight class, but the Crimson answered with a takedown by junior Cameron Croy, who secured a 6-1 win.Freshman Michael Mocco hit the mat for his second college match but this time was able to walk away with a victory.“Mocco did a really great job responding to injuries,” Peppelman said. “Michael broke his neck in the beginning of the year, and this weekend was his first time back wrestling in competition, so for him to be the winner over a tough competitor in a high pressure situation was phenomenal.”Boston University picked up the two final bouts, but Harvard ended the meet with a definitive 31-6 victory.“I’d really like to point out that the freshmen did a really good job,” Peppelman said. “Half of the wrestlers competing against BU were freshmen, so it’s really good to get that big win with such a young team.”

Socrates is usually described as having been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens. Plato suggests that the charge accuses Socrates of political heresy: By publicly rejecting the Homeric gods, Socrates placed himself outside of the community. As an atheist, or so his accusers alleged, he had failed as a citizen.Socrates, of course, was not an atheist at all (a point which he made repeatedly, labeling atheism an unjust crime), nor were the Christians who were called atheists and persecuted by Roman emperors for rejecting the state religion. Atheism, in its most technical sense, is the rejection of a god or gods, but the word carries a historical insult: An atheist is someone who has rejected civil society.Our pluralistic democracy has its intellectual roots in the writings of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke, but even his “Letter Concerning Toleration” explicitly exempts atheists from those worthy of civic participation. “Promises, covenants, and oaths”—the good faith that binds together civil society—“can have no hold on an atheist.” That notion stayed in the social contract and crossed the Atlantic: Even today, seven state constitutions technically forbid atheists from holding public office. And though the numbers have been steadily improving, recent polls <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/26611/some-americans-reluctant-vote-mormon-72yearold-presidential-candidates.aspx"">suggest that 53 percent of Americans would not vote for a well-qualified atheist and that 39.6 percent of Americans <a href=""http://asr.sagepub.com/content/71/2/211.full.pdf+html"">believe that atheists do not agree at all with their “vision of American society.”Civil society depends on upholding certain moral norms, and for that reason our religious and political identities rightfully seem so entwined. But to some, a lack of faith is more than just a lack of faith. It is a lack of good faith.We all know that this is false: Atheists are artists, philanthropists, scientists, teachers, and public servants. The command to love your neighbor needs no divine imprimatur. Yet many of us who live without religion remain reluctant to identify as what we are. Atheism is too “extreme” or “confrontational,” as we’ve heard from students at club fairs or introductory meetings. Our generation is the least religious that this country has seen, with 26 percent of young American adults <a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Demographics/Age/millennials-report.pdf"">identifying with no religion. But only three percent of us will take the extra step to identify as atheists.
For some, this is for principled, philosophical reasons: Some of us are agnostic, and some even hold religious beliefs but feel estranged from the institutions identified with them. Yet there remains a gap, a group of young people whose worldview does not include a deity but whose discomfort with the notion of atheism keeps them silent.This doesn’t make much sense. As long as atheists abdicate from defining ourselves, we will be defined by those who see absence from the religious community as absence from our political and social communities. No belief system has a monopoly on reason, dialogue, and concern for the public good. These values drove Martin Luther King, Jr. as much as they drove A. Philip Randolph, an atheist and key organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, or W.E.B. Du Bois, a skeptic and freethinker whose writings helped frame the civil rights movement. Fifty years after the march, 50 years after Du Bois’ death, our generation can be even more open about our identities as we fight for broader definitions of justice and equality. Those of us who have been given the opportunity to confront those challenges must do so without fear that our lack of religious commitment will undermine our shared values.Our generation is not only the most secular in this country’s history, but it is also the most diverse, and the variety and intersectionality of our individual identities is central to who we are as a collective. If we are to forge a community out of these various parts, we must learn to embrace and engage with our differences, to determine which disagreements matter and which ones make us stronger. The first step, though, is to recognize this, and for those whose identities are in the minority to confidently make our voices heard.This is why the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics is holding Atheist Coming Out Week, a chance for our campus’s atheists to say who we are and why our beliefs matter. We want to prove something you already know: that atheists can coexist with the religious in a pluralistic society and that our commitment to reason, science, creativity, and compassion is essential to solving the world’s ills.Here’s the moral of the story: If you happen not to believe in a god, say so. And while you’re at it, join us for a discussion on Why Atheism Matters with Steven Pinker ’79, Rebecca N. Goldstein, Andrew Jewett, and Greg M. Epstein today in Lamont Library. Celebrate atheist and humanist Eddie Izzard’s lifetime achievements with us in Memorial Church this Wednesday. And watch a movie with us in the SOCH Community Hall on Friday. We all thrive when we can share our identities without fear. We are atheists. We are proud. Come out with us.Sarah E. Coughlon ’15 is a psychology concentrator in Adams House. Elliot A.

The battle between the No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team and No. 5 Cornell was a classic heavyweight bout. Friday night at the Lynah Rink, the two teams dueled for ECAC supremacy in a physical game marked by 14 penalties, including four roughing calls.“There were times where we had them on the ropes and they had us on the ropes,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said.Ultimately, it was speed, not strength, that helped Cornell protect its home ice with a 3-1 win.Eight minutes into the third period, the Big Red’s Jessica Campbell broke a 1-1 tie after winning the puck at center-ice. The junior blew by Harvard’s defense on the side wall and carved back towards the goal. Gliding across the crease, Campbell enticed freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer to slide across with the shooter before Campbell deposited the puck on the shortside.Six minutes later, Campbell gave Cornell a security goal in similar fashion. During a penalty kill, the forward won possession of the puck in the neutral zone and used her speed to create a breakaway opportunity. This time, Campbell fired a shot by Maschmeyer on the far side.
“We played them pretty tough and they got a couple of extra bounces and were able to capitalize,” Co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “Sometimes plays like that where they were able to capitalize, they were able to get around us.”With the victory, Cornell (21-5-1, 16-3-1 ECAC) retained its ECAC point lead, though Harvard (19-4-2, 15-2-1) still controls its own destiny with four games to play.Campbell’s second marker was a low point for the Crimson power play unit, which was 0-for-6 with a man advantage.“We tried to find the seams and we had some looks at the net but we need to move the puck,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Cornell, one of the reasons their penalty kill is good is that they block a lot of shots, and so [there are] things to learn and we hope the next time we get the opportunity to play them we’ll make some pretty good adjustments.”The Crimson’s power-kill was just as effective as the Big Red’s, as Cornell went goalless on four power-play chances. The two defenses were strong against even-strength attacks as well, surrendering few good looks to opposing shooters.The Big Red’s first goal came when a shot from the top of the circle caromed off the leg of a Harvard defender. The puck got past Maschmeyer just after senior Kaitlin Spurling finished serving a two-minute cross-checking penalty.The Crimson responded in the second period with a goal of its own. Eight minutes into the period, sophomore Samantha Reber dropped a pass to classmate Hillary Crowe, who wove into the slot and flicked a shot past Cornell’s goalie. Crowe’s goal was her second in as many games after going goalless for two months. Reber is also on a hot streak; including Saturday’s game against Colgate, the sophomore has tallied six points in three games, twice as many as she had in the previous month.Following Crowe’s goal, the two teams went twenty minutes without a goal before Campbell finally broke the tie. During that time, the two squads showed signs of increasing frustration, combining for seven penalties, including calls for roughing, boarding, hooking, and slashing. Several other controversial open-ice collisions were met with play-on calls from the referees.“That’s the kind of team they are; they try to intimidate you with their size,” Stone said. “We handled that well but I think we can play more physically under control as well.”Harvard was unable to respond to Campbell’s two-goal third period. It took a number of shots late but many flew wide or were blocked as Cornell’s goalie was forced to make stops on only six of 23 shots.“I think Cornell is a good team and they showed up ready to go and they had a bit of an edge over us and we just couldn’t find the back of the net,” Dempsey said. “We weren’t getting to the goalie’s face enough; we weren’t putting shots on net. We weren’t really challenging her.”After the scoreless third, the Crimson left the ice with just one goal for the fourth time in seven games. Prior to that stretch, Harvard had scored at least twice in 14 straight games and had been held to one goal only once in its first 19 games.“You can’t overanalyze it,” Stone said. “That’s the way it typically should be against real good goaltending. It is what it is, so I’m not concerned about it.”—Staff writer Jacob D. H. Feldman can be reached at jacobfeldman@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter @jacobfeldman4.

There were a series of indelible images from the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 69-57 win over Princeton on Saturday. It was freshman point guard Siyani Chambers diving on the floor to rescue a loose ball, skidding so fast across the hardwood he nearly ran into the scorer’s table. It was Laurent Rivard pivoting and shooting, all in one motion, to drain a three right before the half to stretch a one-point lead to a four-point advantage. It was sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith swatting two of Tiger senior forward Ian Hummer’s shots into the second row. It was sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi slamming home a last-second dunk to cap off the night.The Crimson plays its best against the best competition. Against likely tournament competition Saint Mary’s, only a late pair of free throws held back Harvard from coming up with a last-second win in a hostile road environment. Against Boston College and Cal, the Crimson won by 16 and five, respectively, on the road against Big Six programs. Until Chambers fouled out against current No. 22 Memphis, Harvard was tied 50-50 with Josh Pastner’s talented squad. Saturday against Princeton was no different.Even with sophomore wing Wesley Saunders submitting a poor shooting effort and combining with Chambers to go six-of-23 from the floor, the team’s balanced attack netted a win. Five players scored in double digits, and a sixth—co-captain and forward Christian Webster—came up with two clutch threes at crucial moments. But the team’s overall balanced performance was not the story of the weekend.Smith, with 16 blocks, 16 rebounds, and 34 points in two games, submitted the 24 hours of his life in spectacular efforts against Penn and the Tigers. Starting against the Quakers for the first time in 12 games, Smith was a Ricky Davis—throwing the ball off the backboard to get yourself that last rebound—away from a triple-double on Friday night. Despite being sidelined with early foul trouble against Princeton, Smith didn’t miss a shot on the night, making all nine—four from the free throw line—that he took.When Crimson coach Tommy Amaker plays Smith and Moundou-Missi together, as he did for long stretches against the Tigers, Harvard brings a different look.
Moundou-Missi showed off his range with two jumpers from just inside the three-point line Saturday and can provide the spacing the Crimson loses by subbing out Webster or junior co-captain Laurent Rivard. Inside, Smith has been the model of efficiency for Harvard. He missed just two shots on 20 total attempts—field goals and free throws—over the weekend and has shot fifty percent or better in all but three Crimson games. His jump hook, possibly his only yet devastatingly effective inside move, is a thing of beauty.Smith has given Harvard three forward-centers to play at the five, and the increased flexibility has allowed Amaker more lineup possibilities. Sophomore forward Jonah Travis, who has started 14 games for the Crimson this year, came off the bench for the second game in a row Saturday and gives the team seven starter-quality players in the rotation. Smith’s shot blocking ability also gives the team what it needed most—interior defense.Much like what Saunders can do on the perimeter, Smith boasts long arms that he can use to reach balls that Travis and Moundou-Missi cannot.In addition to his long reach, the sophomore rarely fouls—he has hit three fouls only twice this season and accumulated four fouls in 51 minutes this weekend—and provides a deterrent for guards trying to penetrate the heart of the team’s defense. This allows Saunders and Chambers to be more aggressive on the defensive end and close out on shooters, knowing that they have backup. This showed against Princeton, the best three-point shooting team in the Ivy League. The Tigers shot one-for-six against Harvard when Smith manned the middle in the second half.The Crimson submitted easily its best two performances of the Ivy League season against Penn and Princeton, and Smith was the biggest reason why. For the team to realize its preseason goals, it likely will need to win out to take home the Ancient Eight title. With Smith swatting shots on the interior, and with the Tigers now a game-and-a-half back of Harvard with five of its next seven on the road, the chances of that look as good as they ever have.—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

The colors, music, and energy of South Asia will light up Agassiz Theater starting Feb 28 in the Harvard South Asian Association’s annual cultural variety show, Ghungroo, which is directed by Matt W. Yarri ’14, Hania S. Chima ’14 and Karen Xiao ’14.Featuring punjabi dance styles and dances from across India, the production is student run and features dances, musical acts, and comedy acts performed only by students.With over 300 dancers, musicians, and artists, Ghungroo is the largest student-run production on campus and is in its 24th production “[This] will be the biggest Ghungroo in history,” co-director Matt Yarri ‘14 says.Ghungroo, the name of the event, comes from an Urdu word for an ankle bracelet worn in traditional Indian dance. Increasing recognition of and involvement about South Asian culture is an important goal of the SAA.“Ghungroo is an awesome way to [increase awareness],” SAA treasurer Prateek Agarwal ’15 says. “By sharing South Asian culture, Ghungroo tends to bring people of all ethnicities to participate,” he says. No less than half of this year’s performers are of non-South Asian heritage, SAA members say. “We very much pride ourselves on being an open community,” Yarri says.The production it is open to students of non-South Asian background as well as those with no experience. Yarri says that despite his background in technical production, he will be dancing in the  “Bollywood Oldies” act of the performance.Both Yarri and Agarwal are especially excited for Senior Dance, a 20-minute dance medley finale to the show that consist of over 150 performers.
“[Senior Dance is] an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of an act,” Yarri says.The Saturday night performance promises to be especially energetic, Agarwal says. With many alumni returning, including directors and dancers from previous Ghungroos, “the crowd will be rowdy,” he says.

 In 1999, Antwerp was transformed into a series of laboratories and galleries. Throughout the Belgian city, scientists opened their doors to members of the public who were curious to see what they were working on. At the same time, Antwerp’s artists were also welcoming people into their studios and displaying numerous works of art. The citywide exhibition, entitled “Laboratorium,” curated by Barbara Vanderlinden and Hans-Ulrich Obrist, and including Harvard physics professor Peter L. Galison among its artists, was intended to probe the ways art and science are interrelated by inviting the citizens of Antwerp to experience the interfaces between the two disciplines.Despite the historically strong ties between the arts and the sciences—from Leonardo da Vinci, with his painstakingly rendered anatomical investigations to Albert Einstein, who was a gifted violinist—such projects are the exception and not the rule. Today, the two disciplines are conceived of as not only separate but diametrically opposed to each other. Such a caricature, which portrays science as essential but uncreative and art as humanistic but ultimately impractical, is overly simplistic and does not do justice to either discipline.The divide is present at Harvard as well, perhaps nowhere more obvious than in the geography of the University: science and engineering labs sprawl north of Annenberg, while the Barker Center and most of Harvard’s art museums huddle together on a narrow strip of land between Quincy Street and Prescott Street. The first question after the obligatory name-dorm-hometown exchange a freshman is likely to be asked is, “Are you a science person or a humanities person?” It’s a loaded question, one that presumes that it is impossible to be both. And for people whose interests really do straddle the divide between the two, students and professors suggest, such a culture can puts pressure on individuals to focus on one side of their interests and shelve the others.But here, as in Antwerp, academic innovators are pushing back against this either-or culture. A multiplying list of interdisciplinary courses questions the notion that science and art are irreconcilably separated. By creating classes that meld the two together, professors are challenging students to think critically about culture’s perceptions, blurring the boundaries and in some cases rejecting them altogether.
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> <p style=""font-weight: bold;"">CONCEPTUAL ARTAmong those bridging the gap are students who do not merely take an interdisciplinary elective, but who choose to concentrate in two “opposite” fields. Awais Hussain ’15 is such a student: a joint physics-philosophy concentrator, he says the two complement each other more than people might assume. “Philosophers actually love analyzing math and trying to figure out why math [has] this weird kind of position in terms of knowledge. One plus one is always two, no matter where you are on the planet, no matter where you are in the universe,” Hussain says. “Why is it so special in that sense?”“[Philosopher] Bertrand Russell is a prime example of that – he basically redefined logic but he was an amazing mathematician,” Hussain adds. “I think it makes sense because in both subjects you have to think very clearly, very specifically, and focus very much on the small details that most people would arguably miss.”Even the app Hussain is currently trying to launch comes with some philosophical aspects. The program, an intuitive calendar that allows you to log everything you do, is designed to make people more aware of time and break out of bad habits like procrastination. In Hussain’s opinion, people should acknowledge that time and money are both quantifiable assets that can be spent, wasted, and lost.Like Hussain, Aisha K. Down ’14, a joint Physics-English concentrator and inactive Crimson editor, also sees a natural link between her two fields. “Physics and English: they’re a way of using language in order to get at truths which are much more underlying,” she says. Even though she’s hoping to write a fiction thesis, Down feels sure that her background in physics will have an enormous impact on her work. “Physics has made me a much better writer,” she says. “In a way, writing a story is more like solving a problem than other aspects of English because you have to make things logically follow, you have to create your own causality, and you have to sell it.”Down expressed a great deal of frustration at the stereotypes and rivalry that persist between departments. “I don’t think that the end goal [of physics and English]—or the thing that drives them, which is a quest for a kind of truth—is different. I don’t think one has to be less rigorous or more creative or more practical than the other,” she says. “I think a lot of good thinking is killed off by attitudes that different departments have towards each other.”<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">ARTISTIC AWARENESSPhysics professor Peter S. Pershan is one member of the Harvard community attempting to present a picture of art and science unified. His freshman seminar, “You and Your Camera,” examines the science of photography, with topics ranging from quantum mechanics to how the eye works. The course also delves into photography’s history and asks students to try their hand at the art.While he spends much of his time working with physics at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Pershan has always had an interest in photography. “It’s been a hobby of mine for many years,” he says. “I would describe myself as an old child, and I think most of my colleagues, especially in sciences, are. What do you do when you’re five years old? You play with toys, and that’s how you learn. I love playing, and photography is just part of that.”

Students and community members gathered in Lamont Forum Room on Monday evening for an open discussion on atheism. The panel event “Why Atheism Matters” was the kick-off for “Atheist Coming Out Week.”The Harvard Community for Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics planned the event and others which will happen this week with the goal of helping Harvard students who do not believe in God “drop the A word,” according to Sarah E. Coughlon ’15, HCHAA Vice President of Outreach.  HCHAA President Elliot A. Wilson ’15 noted that the label “atheist” is associated with considerable stigma.“HCHAA sees Atheist Coming Out Week as an opportunity for nonreligious people on campus to feel safe asserting their identity, and it’s also a chance to destigmatize a word that, even on a secular college campus, can leave a bitter taste in people’s mouths,” Wilson wrote in an email.Panelists at the event included psychology professor Steven Pinker and history and Social Studies professor Andrew J. Jewett. Humanist Chaplain, Greg M. Epstein, moderated the discussion.To start off the event, Coughlon encouraged attendees to sign a “Coming Out” banner, take a pin labeled “Got Soul? Me Neither,” and read the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/18/harvard-atheist-week/"">“We are Atheists, and So Can You!” editorial published online in The Crimson on Monday.
After Epstein introduced the panelists, Pinker recounted his own experience “coming out” as an atheist. As he said, “I felt like I was confessing to murder. Since then, I have gotten completely used to it.”According to Pinker, the term “atheist” is a misnomer because “you don’t define yourself by the [ideas] you don’t believe in.”Pinker also expressed the idea that atheists do not need to compete with other religions. According to Pinker, many developments and institutions such as jazz music, the Constitution, and Harvard University have been the product of secular or humanist goals.“One of the biggest advantages of being atheist is getting to sleep in on Sunday mornings. Who wants to give that up?” Pinker jokingly concluded.Many students felt that the event was a great opportunity to reflect on their religious identities and conceptions of atheism.“Concerning my stance on religion, I have been wrestling with a large number of conflicting feelings as of late. I felt that the secular perspective is frequently suppressed—stigmatized even,” said attendee Justin D. Porter ’16, “This event gave me a guilt-free avenue to explore the realistic possibility that I may be an atheist.”

On Feb 24, the Boston Chamber  Music Society will perform the third installment of its annual six-concert “Sanders Series.” “[The concert will showcase] three works full of youth and vigor that have withstood the test of time,” says Erica Shiller, the BCMS’s marketing and research associate.The BCMS, a large Boston-based association of well-known and professionally acclaimed musicians, is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. The group will be represented at Sanders Theatre by three of its members—Harumi Rhodes,  Ronald Thomas, and Mihae Lee—and guest artist Dimitri Murrath, who will be playing the lead in Mendelssohn’s Viola Sonata in C Minor. From a piece written for one musician, the concert will transition into a duet, Kodaly’s Duo for Violin and Cello, and conclude with Fauré’s Piano Quartet No. 1.While united by their continued popularity and appeal, each piece on the program comes from a distinct moment in musical history. Mendelssohn’s sonata, in addition to being the first sonata written specifically for viola, was one of the German composer’s first compositions, which he completed at age 15. Published in 1824, the early piece helped to launch a successful composing career in the Romantic era.Leaving 19th-century Germany behind, the concert ventures into another century and nation with Kodaly’s Duo, composed in Hungary in 1914. Kodaly’s friend and fellow influential Hungarian composer Béla Bartók said of Kodaly “[H]is works are the most perfect embodiment of the Hungarian spirit.”The last piece in the concert, Fauré’s piano quartet, is a moderate and mellow work that was composed in the middle of his career. The French composer’s career is considered innovative because of his use of clear, distinctive melodies and unresolved subtle dischord. This piano quartet is considered the most popular of his chamber works.Rhodes, the concert’s violinist, expressed her excitement about the program. “From the Kodaly Duo to the Fauré Piano Quartet, this concert will take the listener on a journey that spans the entire gamut of human emotions,” she says.

Over 400 Harvard students and community members flocked into Quincy Dining Hall on Friday night for a traditional Chinese New Year celebration, complete with a 12-course banquet and entertainment.The annual celebration was organized by the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association, and included performances by the Asian-American Dance Troupe, the Harvard Breakers, and the Harvard Din and Tonics.Students who attended the event said they felt that it was a good venue for members of the community to celebrate the New Year in a meaningful and festive way.“Since I couldn’t spend Chinese New Year with my family, I felt like this would be the perfect way to feel closer to home.” said attendee Connie M. Hsu ’16.Presidents of HRCSA Lynelle T. Chen ’14 and Eric Y. H. Chung ’14 kicked off the event by welcoming guests into the Year of the Snake.
Throughout the night servers brought out many courses of Chinese food, including Bang Bang Chicken, Ma Po Tofu, Gan Bian String Beans, and mountains of white steamed rice.But for students, the importance of the event went beyond the food and entertainment.“Chinese New Year means bonding with all of my friends and gaining a deeper understanding of a culture that I very much consider a part of me,” Francisco X. Galdos ’15 said.Following the first few courses, the Harvard Din and Tonics solicited many laughs with three singing routines, concluding with their hit “I Fell In Love with a McDonald’s Girl.”Reylon A. Yount ’16, who performed a traditional Chinese instrument called the yangqin for the group, said that he found performing at this event especially meaningful.“It was an honor to play for such an energetic audience,” Yount said. “It’s always wonderful to play at events like this, but the fact that it was a Chinese New Year’s banquet made it particularly special.”During the final performance of the night two performers came on stage in a two-man lion costume and proceeded to throw oranges and lettuce leaves into the crowd. Attendee Jennifer Leung ’16 praised the final performance, saying that it “was exemplary of Chinese traditional culture,” and “energizing and lively.”The event ended by honoring graduating seniors who have served on the HRCSA board in the past by recognizing them with a rose on stage.Julia Hu ’13, who received a rose, said that the celebration “brought back great memories of my time on board.”“I’m sure it will be the first of many events that will remind me that we’re really graduating,” she added.Overall, organizers agreed that the event was a success in celebrating Chinese culture and heralding the Year of the Snake. Chung wrote in an email statement, “It can sometimes be a mad dash to the finish, but it is worth it every year when we realize how much Banquet has engaged our community and when we hear about how much our attendees have enjoyed the event.”

The Cambridge City Council passed a resolution last Monday night declaring its support for the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers as the union continues its ongoing negotiations with the University.City Council member Leland Cheung authored the resolution, which was then approved unanimously by the rest of the Council.Current negotiations are the longest in history between the University and HUCTW, which represents over 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty staff. Because both sides have been unable to reach an agreement, the old contract, which expired July 1 of last year, still remains in effect.In addition to voicing the Council’s support for HUCTW, the resolution addresses the dispute over workers’ salaries, which remains the main source of disagreement in the negotiations.“Negotiations that ensure a consistent salary increase program and affordable health care solutions for union employees are essential for the sustenance of Cambridge’s local economy, community, and employees therein,” the Council wrote in its resolution.
In response to the City Council’s resolution and to assertions that the terms of the University’s proposed contract are not generous enough, a University spokesperson wrote in a statement that Harvard “share[s] the Council’s hope for a constructive resolution to the ongoing negotiations.”“We are confident that our wage proposals, which have consistently been well above local inflation, are both fair and competitive,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement.Cheung said the Council hopes the resolution will demonstrate to the union workers that the Council supports them, in addition to bringing awareness about the negotiations to the Cambridge community.Cheung, a recent graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, said that the HUCTW negotiations are especially important to him because he has experienced experienced firsthand the support that Harvard’s staff provides to the community.“The issue is very personal for me, that we support the people who upported me in pursuing an education and made it such a pleasurable experience,” Cheung said.HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that the Cambridge City Council has a long history of working with the union.“It’s heartening for our members to know that the broader community, including elected officials, is paying attention and caring about what’s going on here,” said Jaeger.“I hope it’s meaningful to the management negotiators also,” he continued.—Staff writer Christine Y.

If you think of skiing as simply a fun sport to watch in the Winter Olympics or a recreational activity when there’s snow outside (thanks, Nemo!), 26 people at Harvard would beg to differ. Although there’s no way to watch these alpine and Nordic skiers unless you make the three-hour drive to Vermont, The Back Page’s new series presents five things you should know about their sport to support their teams from the comfort of your dorm.
5. GIANT
No, giant slalom does not equate a larger mountain that alpine skiers must ski down. Instead, the gates that a skier must maneuver around are spaced further apart than they are in slalom, yielding a slightly slower speed than in its sister event. While alpine skiing is also composed of the “super giant slalom” (even more space between the poles) and “downhill” (few turns, and as the name suggests, going straight down a mountain), collegiate races often use only the technical events—giant slalom and slalom.
4. Skates or skis
When you looked outside your window this weekend and saw people skiing around on the streets, Nordic coach Chris City would term that “Classic” skiing.  In an actual race, classic skiing is done in parallel tracks, but the Nemo skiers resemble more of classic skiers than they would the “skate” style. In skate skiing, the skiers look more like skaters than normal skiers (with the parallel skis)—the skis are angled outwards and often yields a faster speed through the course.
3. Size does matter
If you see the skiers walking around campus with their ski bags, don’t be alarmed by how heavy their bags look—they have more than just one pair of skis. For alpine skiers, GS skis are often longer and wider than slalom skis to keep as much contact with the snow between gates, while slalom skis are shorter to increase speed. On the Nordic side, skate skis are often shorter than their classic counterparts, causing a need for ski bags with a lot of room.
2. Waxing their equipment
 
When a skier talks about waxing before a race, rest assured that they’re (probably) not talking about a body part. In order to make their skis glide faster, skiers will wax before a race—<a href=""http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/glide-waxing-skis-snowboard.html"">their skis, that is. By applying a thin layer of glide wax (for alpine skis or Nordic skate skis) or grip wax (for Nordic classic skis), the skis develop a thin film in contact with the snow that makes the ski friction with the snow optimal.
1. Crimson stars
Although the Harvard skiers may be competing far from home, success is never far from their grasp. Last year, alpine skier Rebecca Nadler took home the Crimson’s <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/10/rebecca-nadler-skiing-national-championship/"">first ever national title at the NCAA Championships in Montana and is looking for a repeat title in 2013. On the Nordic side, freshman skier Emily Hannah recently made it to the 2013 FIS Junior World Championships for the second time in a row, a step which her coach calls a catalyst for the rookie to possibly make it onto the US National team someday.

The stakes were high across the river at the Murr Center, as Harvard men’s squash took on Yale (11-3, 5-2 Ivy) with an Ivy League title on the line. The Crimson (15-2, 6-1) and its chief rival were tied at the top of the Ivy League at 5-1 in conference play going into their first match since ‘Nemo’ disrupted both squads’ schedules.As has been the case in recent meetings between the two schools, the match was closely contested throughout and featured multiple thrillers. In the wee hours of the night, Harvard proved too strong and took the victory, 6-3, earning a share of the Ivy League championship in front of the capacity crowd.“[Crimson coach Mike Way] always uses a quote from Michael Jordan,” junior Brandon McLaughlin said.  “’When the pressure is on we are the ones who stay the same and everyone else changes.’”The title is the first for the men under the tutelage of Way, who is now in his third season with the squad.“I’m delighted,” Way said. “It was a team of young men.  They showed what they are made of.”
The clincher came from the squad’s co-captain Zeke Scherl who lined cross-court to cap off a 3-1 victory over his Yale opponent with an 11-5 win in the final game.Going into the third and final flight, the Crimson had control, edging its opponents 4-3 after junior Ali Farag took care of business in straight sets. In the final two matches, the Crimson secured key victories from Scherl and Gary Power.Though both squads had opportunities to pull ahead, the match stayed even throughout, with five of the nine matches being decided in five games.Junior Nigel Koh emerged victorious in the first of these early five-gamers. After taking control of the match toward the end of the fourth frame, Koh turned it on to convincingly win the final frame, 11-0.“For Nigel [Koh] to win in five at the number three position was really vital,” coach Way said.McLaughlin also had a big match. He outlasted Yale’s No. 2 Hywel Robinson after falling to him in four games earlier in the season.“He’s a physical player,” McLaughlin said.  “I tried to control the center of the court as much as possible and keep him running so he couldn’t really get in my way.”The night was one of tribute to seniors Scherl, Jason Michas, Alexander Ma, Charles Cabot, Shaw McKean, who each played his last match at home.“They led in the gym and with work ethic and they were just awesome,” Way said.The night ended with mixed results for the seniors in the nine-man rotation.

With a historic win against Princeton two weekends ago in the books, the No. 16 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had just one dual meet left on its schedule. Having taken down all other opponents, the Crimson (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) had its eyes set on an undefeated dual meet season. All that stood in the way was one last matchup against conference foe Penn.“That [win against Princeton] was huge for us,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “We had never beaten Princeton in their home pool before, so we had a tremendous amount of momentum coming off of that. Everyone was really excited to get back to the pool.”Harvard would have to wait an extra week to face off against the Quakers due to weather conditions that made travel near impossible last weekend. But it was business as usual for the Crimson, who took down Penn, 195-98, to conclude its perfect season.“For this meet, more so than in the past, [we] were orienting ourselves for our championships meets at the end of the season,” fellow co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “Today was really about toughness and competing and staying aggressive. We did that.”Harvard got off to a hot start, as sophomore Chuck Katis and juniors Jack Pretto, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite combined for a time of 1:30.66 to win the 200 medley relay. Lee went on to pick up a victory in the 100 butterfly later that afternoon.
The Crimson picked up wins in the next three events. Sophomore Mike Gaudiani finished with a time of 9:23.61 to claim a victory in the 1000 freestyle. Roop edged out teammates freshman Ty Rocca and senior Ryan Cutter for a 1-2-3 finish for Harvard in the 200 freestyle. Pretto hit the wall in a time of 50.24 for a win in the 100 backstroke.The Crimson concluded with wins in eight of the final 12 events, for a total of 12 victories on the day. Freshman Christian Carbone and classmate Christian Yeager won the 200 butterfly and the 200 backstroke, respectively, and junior Danny Crigler picked up a win in the 50 free. Crigler also finished second to sophomore Griffin Schumacher in the 100 free. Roop rounded out the top three in the event for another 1-2-3 finish for Harvard.The Crimson also swept the podium in the 500 free. Satterthwaite finished in a time of 4:36.23 to take top honors, closely followed by Gaudiani and fellow sophomore John Bailey. The trio finished within three seconds of each other and over eight seconds ahead of their next nearest competitor.Sophomore Michael Mosca claimed top honors in both of the meet’s diving events, taking home first in the three-meter and one-meter contests. Harvard claimed the top four spots in both events.The win on Senior Day capped the Crimson’s second undefeated season in the past three years.“It was a little bit surreal, after the meet when I realized it was the last time I would ever swim a meet in our home pool,” Roop said. “But it was so sweet going out knowing you had beaten everyone in the league.”In addition to being Senior Day, another added focus for the day’s events was on the team’s “Ironman” challenge.“We have a tradition on the team every year where the freshman who best exudes the qualities that characterize HMSD is elected Ironman for his class,” Wurzbacher said. “He is required to swim in every single heat of every single event. It’s a really challenging individual thing to do. One of the most fun parts of the season is being out there, supporting him through that.”This year, freshman Jacob Luna was chosen for the Class of 2016. In addition, Katis, a sophomore, competed in all the day’s swimming events as well. Katis, who has already qualified for this year’s NCAA Championships, was unable to complete his Ironman last year due to scheduling issues.Now with its dual meet schedule concluded, Harvard has its eyes set solely on its championship meets in the coming weeks. The Crimson’s main goal for the entire season has been reclaiming the Ivy League title from No. 20 Princeton.“The best perspective we can have is to view ourselves as underdogs,” Wurzbacher said. “The facts are that Princeton has won the Ivy League Championship every single one of the past four years; Princeton’s the favorite. They’ve won four years in a row, but we’re going in to upset them.”In total, the Crimson earned first place in 12 of the day’s 16 events.—Staff writer Brenna R.

Harvard’s Dexter Gate beseeches Harvard students to “go forth to serve thy country and thy kind.” President Faust seems to <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/05/faust-emphasizes-public-service/"">echo this plea at every Commencement, encouraging students to engage in public service through programs like her Presidential Public Service Fellowship and the Center for Public Interest Careers. But as more students consider “going forth to serve,” it’s important to think about what, exactly, it means to do public service after graduation.It’s well known that Harvard students disproportionately go on to work in investment banking and consulting after graduation. This fact has caused consternation to everyone from New York Times blogger <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/out-of-harvard-and-into-finance/"">Catherine Rampell to <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-13/goldman-says-class-dismissed-as-occupy-harvard-mars-recruiting-sessions.html"">Occupy Harvard to <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/04/why_do_harvard_kids_head_to_wa.html"">Ezra Klein. But in recent years, the Ivy-to-Wall-Street pipeline seems to have slowed: The percentage of Harvard students who reported going into consulting or investment banking after graduation has <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/6/22/harvard-graduates-head-to-investment-banking/"">declined from 47 percent in 2007, to 39 percent in 2008, to only<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/5/24/percent-seniors-entering-class/""> 22 percent in 2011, according to The Crimson’s annual senior survey. There are many possible explanations for this: Perhaps the financial sector seemed less attractive after the financial crisis of 2008; perhaps the encouragement of Harvard administrators and student activists has actually paid off.At the same time, the percentage of students entering “public service” jobs immediately after graduation seems to have increased. For example, The Crimson reported that 11.4 percent of students who graduated last spring went into education. A survey by the Office of Career Services presents a similar trend, also <a href=""http://www.ocs.fas.harvard.edu/students/jobs/seniorsurvey.htm"">suggesting that the number of students working in the nonprofit industry immediately after college rose from 4 percent in 2006 to 7 percent in 2011.But what exactly counts as “public service?” The Phillips Brooks House Association <a href=""http://alumni.pbha.org/hot-of-the-presses-alumni-weekends-outstanding-alumni-supporters/"">has lauded alums such as Aaron Tanaka ‘04, who went on to work with community organizations doing advocacy work that makes real change in the lives of underserved populations, like unemployed workers in Boston. But when many Harvard students think of doing good in the world, they think of either part-time volunteer work, public policy, or Teach For America. For example, Currier House’s public service tutors <a href=""http://currier.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k67717&amp;pageid=icb.page442135"">tell their students they support students “whether you’re interested in working in government, nonprofit, education, politics, international development, or just want to volunteer.”By now, most Harvard undergraduates realize that volunteering a few hours a week while working at Goldman Sachs is unlikely to benefit much other than one’s own conscience, so more students have begun searching for postgraduate jobs in “public service.” Public Interested, a Wintersession conference coordinated by Harvard’s new Assistant Dean for Public Service, Gene Corbin, featured speakers on “public interest” careers that ranged from government to socially responsible investment to community organizing.
But for those who actually want to make a difference, it’s important to think beyond simply finding a career labeled “public service” by the Office of Career Services. Jobs in nonprofit consulting, nonprofit management, corporate social responsibility, and responsible investing may feel more moral than their non-responsible counterparts, yet corporate social responsibility often simply <a href=""http://ejbo.jyu.fi/pdf/ejbo_vol13_no1_pages_13-21.pdf"">excuses corporate excesses to the public instead of actually benefitting society. The <a href=""http://www.utne.com/Politics/Revolution-Will-not-be-Funded-Nonprofit-Industrial-Complex.aspx"">nonprofit industrial complex has stifled true efforts to make positive change in people’s lives by taking energy and funding away from activist and advocacy organizations, so working in nonprofit management or consulting might harm more than it helps. CPIC touts summer and postgrad positions at charter schools, which have been roundly <a href=""http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/from-portfolios-to-parasites-the-unfortunate-path-of-u-s-charter-school-policy/"">decried for corporatizing schools and harming students and teachers.  And, as Emma M.  Lind ’09, a former TFA teacher and former Crimson editorial chair, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/11/rethinking-teach-for-america/"">urged in her op-ed “Rethink TFA” last week, students who truly want to make positive change in the education system should think critically about engaging with a nominally do-good organization that may actually be hurting schools by replacing effective full-time teachers with inexperienced recruits.Simply working at a policy think tank or as a politician doesn’t guarantee that you’ll actually be able to help people. Indeed, popular postgraduate pursuits like government work, nonprofit consulting, and TFA complicate the idea of “public service” for Harvard alums.Students who want to really do good for the world might take pause at some of what passes for “public service careers” at Harvard. The Public Service portal’s calendar of events <a href=""http://www.publicservice.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k84594&amp;pageid=icb.page543351"">lists an information session for the Defense Intelligence Agency, which <a href=""http://www.dia.mil/about/"">describes itself as “a Department of Defense combat support agency.” I would argue that supporting the combat operations of the Department of Defense is far from a public service. In fact, if a Harvard alum truly wanted to serve her country and her kind, she might be better off working for an advocacy organization that lobbied against funding for the Department of Defense.If students intentionally avoid jobs on Wall Street in order to “do good for the world,” we should think hard about whether the jobs we do take will actually make sustainable, productive, and beneficial change. It would be nice if the OCS, CPIC, and Dean for Public Service put more thought into what careers they laud as “public interest.” Otherwise, well-meaning Harvard students run the risk of simply “going forth to serve” the OCS’s statistics and our own egos.Sandra Y.

While a few members of the Harvard ski team will be back on the very same hill at Middlebury less than three weeks from now at NCAA Championships, most of the skiers enjoyed their last races of the carnival season at the Breadloaf and Snow Bowl.This weekend marked the last regular season races, as the team now looks ahead to the EISA Championships and NCAA Championships in the weeks to come.On the Nordic side, freshman Emily Hanna led the Crimson women for the first day, finishing 35th overall with a time of 17:36. Junior Chris Stock paced the men, placing 16th with a time of 27:16, keeping his hopes of an NCAA berth alive with the result.“Friday was our best classic result of the year and one of the best days we’ve had as a team this season,” Harvard Nordic coach Chris City said. “Saturday’s race was less good. We had a couple of people get injured and one person who was sick, so we were a little short-handed.”Two other Crimson women finished in the top 50 on Friday, with freshman Annie Harvieux and senior Alena Tofte—who was returning from an injury—placing 41st and 42nd, respectively.
Saturday proved to be more of a challenge for the Nordic team, whose top finisher on the women’s side was unable to break the top 40. Despite the result, City credited junior Jen Rolfes—who placed 43rd—with one of her best races of the season. On the men’s side, sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci came in 19th after starting close to the back.“[Jen Rolfes] did the same thing that Akeo did,” City said. “It was a mass start race, and she was almost at the back of the field and skied her way all the way up. She did it the hard way, by having to pass a lot of people.”City was impressed with the speed that his skiers were still showing toward the end of the season, especially the freshmen that are still adjusting to a college racing schedule. The Nordic roster boasts five freshmen.“Overall I’m pleased with how we are skiing this late in the season,” City said. “It’s a time when a lot of teams are getting slower and we’re getting faster, so that’s great…. They’re doing a good job of getting rest and recovery during the week so that when we get to the weekends and we’re racing, they’re still feeling reasonably fresh.”The alpine team also remained competitive throughout the weekend, as junior Rebecca Nadler—the first Harvard skier to win an NCAA title—led the way in the giant slalom with a ninth place finish in 2:11.55. Nadler followed up the performance with a 15th place finish in the slalom after she shaved almost a second off of her time in the second run.“I know I need to put two strong ones together,” Nadler said. “That’s the hill that NCAAs are going to be on, so I was happy to get at least one fast run in and know the hill a little better.”Senior Catherine Sheils came in 29th overall despite a mistake in the second run that added over two seconds to her previous time.The men had more difficulty breaking into the upper reaches of the standings. In both events, freshman Matthew Mansson was the only skier to finish both runs in both events, coming in 43rd overall in the giant slalom and the slalom.Freshman Jack Stobierski qualified for the second round in the slalom for the first time in his career, but he did not finish.“It’s pretty tough with the top 60 cutoff [to qualify for the second race],” Nadler said. “The men’s team is competing against guys who were on national teams and skiing world cups. Our guys don’t quite have the mileage that those guys do.”

With her team up, 4-2, against No. 4 Trinity through the first two rotations, sophomore Amanda Sobhy took center stage at the Brady Squash Courts in New Haven, Conn. The No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team (15-1, 6-1 Ivy) was just one win away from successfully defending its national title.It was the second time that Sobhy and her opponent, Kanzy El Defraway of the Bantams, had faced off this season. Though Sobhy bested her opponent, 3-1, when they first met just over a week ago, El Defraway handed the sophomore the first game loss of her collegiate career in that early February meeting.This time around, Sobhy wasted little time, stringing together 11-8, 11-7, and 11-8 wins to pick up the victory and seal the national title for the Crimson.“Amanda has been a perennial force at No. 1,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “She clinched the fifth match for us. It did come down to the end, but we had total confidence in her play there.”Harvard ended the tournament with a 5-4 win over Trinity to take home the Howe Cup for the third time in the past four years and 14th time in program history.
“It was a really tough weekend, both mentally and physically,” Kingshott said. “But this day, for every individual player, whether they won or lost, was just the culmination of a whole season’s worth of hard work and dedication.... We’ve had some bumps along the road, but we’ve proven ourselves to be a resilient team. I really think we played our best squash today.”The Crimson began its title defense campaign with a 9-0 rout of No. 7 Stanford on Friday in the quarterfinal match.Harvard had a much closer contest in the semifinals, when the Crimson took on No. 3 Penn in a Saturday afternoon showdown. The match was tied, 3-3, after the first two rotations of players. But Harvard pulled away for a 6-3 victory with wins in the final three matches. Freshman Michelle Gemmell pulled out a 3-2 win in the No. 4 slot, Sobhy picked up a 3-0 victory at No. 1, and co-captain Sarah Mumanachit beat her opponent, 3-1, at No. 7.The win over the Quakers pitted the Crimson against the Bantams in the finals after Trinity upset No. 1 Princeton in Saturday’s other semifinal contest.“The whole weekend has really been a roller coaster,” Mumanachit said. “We were really hyped to play Princeton hopefully, since we wanted to avenge our loss earlier this season. But we were happy to play Trinity in the finals. They are really good competitors. It was really close and exciting.”In Harvard’s first meeting with the Bantams this season, the Crimson came away with a comfortable 7-2 victory.“There was a little bit of pressure, since we had a convincing win over them last week, but we knew they were underdogs and ready to challenge us,” Kingshott said. “I think we took it in stride. Throughout the season, we’ve shown that we can handle the pressure.”Harvard jumped out to an early 3-0 lead on Sunday, as sophomore Haley Mendez, Kingshott, and sophomore Megan Murray picked up wins in the No. 3, No. 6, and No. 9 positions, respectively. But the Bantams would go on to win two of the next three matches in the second flight. Playing at No. 8, Julianne Chu lost her match in three straight games, while senior Laura Gemmell suffered her second loss of the season by the same margin at No. 2. Freshman Saumya Karki picked up the lone win for the Crimson in the round with a 3-0 win at No. 5.“We took the early lead, which was really great for our confidence,” Kingshott said. “[But] Trinity is a really formidable opponent. They were hungry for this win as well, and so they came out firing in the next couple rounds.”Though Michelle Gemmell and Mumanachit suffered losses in the No. 4 and No. 7 positions, respectively, Sobhy’s 3-0 win gave Harvard the edge and clinched the national title for the Crimson.“It hasn’t even really set in,” Kingshott said. “I’m just so proud of everyone. When you put in so much work as an individual, and you see all the work your teammates put in, to see it all come together is one of the most gratifying experiences. We couldn’t have ended it in a better way.”—Staff writer Brenna R. Nelsen can be reached at brennanelsen@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter @CrimsonBRN.

Since the era of Classical composer Joseph Haydn, the string quartet has been one of the most prominent arrangements for chamber music. On March 2 in Paine Hall, an extensive collaboration of musicians will juxtapose traditional instrumentation with new, modern pieces, played by the JACK String Quartet. The concert will premiere works composed by members of the Harvard Group for New Music, made up of 16 graduate students in Harvard’s department of Music with diverse musical specializations including composition, theory, musicology, and ethnomusicology.To Timothy McCormack, one of the group’s members, the deep-rooted tradition of the string quartet makes the upcoming performance all the more exciting. “We all write interesting music…from [the Classical] tradition, but it’s not going to sound like a Beethoven quartet,” he says. Instead, the pieces will feature each composer’s unique approach to the music and the ensemble. Marta Gentilucci, an Italian composer and vocalist who will also have a piece premiered at the event, looks forward to the variety of talents that will be showcased. “Each of us have our own compositional world,” she says.The JACK String Quartet, which primarily concentrates on the performance of new works, is made up of  John P. Richards, Ari Streisfeld, Christopher Otto, and Kevin McFarland.  Although some of the composers, including Gentilucci, have not had a chance to work with the JACK Quartet directly, the composers are enthusiastic about the caliber of the upcoming performance. “We are very lucky to have high-level professionals coming to play our pieces,” Gentilucci says. “We have a chance to really work in a professional situation.”McCormack, who has worked with the Quartet before, is equally excited to hear them premiere his works. “You get a sense onstage at their performances…that they’re good friends and they became an ensemble because they wanted to play together. It changes the music.”—Staff writer Se-Ho B. Kim can be reached at sehokim@college.harvard.edu

Around this time last year, the nation was in the throes of Linsanity. This year, a less heralded Harvard professional athlete is just getting started.
Alex Killorn ’12 notched his first career NHL goal Saturday for the Tampa Bay Lightning to help the team to an overtime win, 6-5, over the Florida Panthers. Killorn slid a wrister past the right pad of Panthers goaltender Jose Theodore to put Tampa Bay up, 2-1.
The center from Montreal has made an immediate impact for Tampa Bay after he was called up to start on February 10th at Madison Square Garden. In his first four games, Killorn has posted one goal, one assist, and a plus-one rating while playing on a line with Lightning franchise player Vincent Lecavalier.
The Lightning tabbed Killorn 77th overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft before a senior prep school season in which the center scored 55 points in 24 games for Deerfield Academy. At Harvard, Killorn led the Crimson in goals during his junior and senior seasons. The government concentrator graduated as a CCM Hockey All-American after posting a tournament-high 10 points during the ECAC postseason.

Athanasios Orphanides, former governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, argued during a two-hour study group at the Center of European Studies Friday that the main cause of the current financial crisis in the Euro Zone was political rather than economic in nature.“When I look at why it is that we have this persistent situation that remains unresolved in the Euro area, I want to turn to something somewhat deeper—the Euro area’s structure and governance,” said Orphanides during the study group. “But why is it that having identified the problem we still have nothing to solve it? And there I go to the politics of the situation.”Orphanides is currently a senior lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.During his talk, Orphanides acknowledged that economic factors such as divergence in growth, competitiveness, sovereign bond yields, and unemployment figures in Euro Zone countries were in part to blame for the ongoing problems in Europe’s financial system. However, Orphanides said he thinks the situation was in large part caused by weak economic governance structures due to political mismanagement.The 1992 treaty that created the Euro requires unanimous agreement among all member states in order to adjust the treaty so that it would allow for a long-term solution to a financial crisis.
Because of differing electoral cycles in each of the countries, important political decisions that could have mitigated problems in Europe’s economic climate were postponed, said Orphanides.“The more countries you have, the more problems you are going to run into in finding the correct time when well-meaning governments could actually have agreed to [reach a decision] together,” Orphanides said.The study session, entitled “Politics, Economics and the Euro Area Crises,” was part of a series of talks hosted by the Center of European Studies’ Greek Study Group throughout the semester.The discussion drew a mixture of American and European citizens who, following Orphanides presentation, discussed the future of the European project.Martin Møller Boje Rasmussen, a visiting Ph.D. student from Copenhagen Business School in Denmark, said he was impressed by the study group’s ability to conduct a high level and quality discussion on the causes and the future of the crisis in the Euro Zone.Yannis M. Ioannides, a professor at Tufts and a co-chair of the Greek Study Group. echoed Rasmussen’s sentiments.“Sometimes you have Harvard undergraduates who stun you with the depth of their knowledge,” Ioannides said. “That is why it is great to be at a university like this.”—Staff writer Anja C.

If  caressing the audience is a vital part of a production, an ideal space  to put up the play is the OBERON. A production that relies on mood  whiplash—drastic 180-degree shifts in tone—to effect the feeling of  losing one’s memory could use the space well. And a play that needs to  put something on a pedestal could definitely make use of the air  straight above the drink-clutching audience members, as well as using  tables, balconies, and staircases to give characters brief spotlights.  Thankfully, “Lunar Labyrinth,” which played for one night on February  13, uses the space’s advantages to its ultimate potential. Based on a  short story by Neil Gaiman, the production’s superb use of sound and  space ended up transforming the original short story from its  urban-legend Americana into a play that does its best when imagining the  grand, epic mythologies of what attracted that wanderer to climb up to  the Labyrinth in the first place. Plot-wise,  the wanderer (Phil Berman) takes a respite from walking the Earth to  visit a local attraction called the Lunar Labyrinth, which is rumored to  cure illness if correctly navigated under the full moon’s light. The  script adaptation of Gaiman’s story patches together different local  legends—woman who gives birth to a monster, children and couples drawn  to the moon, the requisite coyotes—all whimsically told by a hobbling,  eccentric guide (John J. King). With classic Gaiman-esque comedy that  suggests cliché only to revile it, King says, “You’ll see how it lies  when we get to the top of the hill”—“How does it lie?”—“At the top of  the hill.” While  the short story—printed out and dimly lit for the audience’s enjoyment  outside of the main room—had more of a dusky, “Twilight Zone” mood and  focused on building suspense between guide and wanderer, the play  doesn’t buy into the same strategy. Rather than building up anecdotes to  culminate in spine-chilling fear, the best scenes of “Lunar Labyrinth”  are those with the emphasis placed on the epic, with wanderer and guide  changing from amused conversationalists to classical guide and wanderer  tropes backed up by a Greek chorus of supporting actors. A surprisingly  serious version of “Lux Aeterna” scores the most memorable of the  scenes, and the decision to cast the lunar protagonist (Eileen Little)  as an aerialist who can sashay her way up silks to the ceiling goes a  long way in effecting the crippling fascination with the moon most of  the characters share. The less successful scenes are the fear-based  ones, like a particularly gruesome birth scene reminiscent of the  alien-from-human-womb scene in last year’s film “Prometheus,” a  confusing choice that might have been a bit too heavy-handed. In fact,  the fear present in Gaiman’s story is often mocked with segues in the  tone of old monster flick “It’s Alive!” moments, and a weird replay of  the birth scene with the mother singing as in a jazz cabaret.
 At  the play and story’s end, the protagonist is left alone at the maze’s  entrance. Granted, given the comical treatment of fear preceding this  climax, it would have been more appropriate for him to hear Admiral  Ackbar’s famous proclamation, “It’s a trap,” rather than the  disembodied, growling “Run” he hears. However, the final moments of the  play come with a big reveal for the audience milling around with  cocktail in hand; alcohol is necessary for the audience to feel less  uncomfortable as actors in powdered face and ripped white clothing  fondle them. Even though the adaptation from story to performance chose  to develop the pure epic and mythological moments rather than the dark,  more dust-swept Americana folklore at which Gaiman excels, it was  ultimately nicest to see an “aha” moment that was so unexpected—we’re  talking on the level of Low-Key Lyesmith’s reveal in “American Gods.”  The unpredictable ending tied the whole production together; it is  apparent that “Lunar Labyrinth” shot for the moon and landed among the  stars. —Staff writer Christine A. Hurd can be reached at churd@college.harvard.edu.

In the past few weeks, the French government has thankfully <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-11/world/37025954_1_malian-gao-islamic-fighters"">intervened in northern Mali, where Islamist insurgents had <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881978"">seized control, imposed Sharia law, and destroyed countless cultural artifacts. Now, however, France has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/world/africa/france-mali-militants.html"">indicated that it wishes to swiftly withdraw its military forces from the country, but such a move would be ill advised. The Malian capital, Bamako, has neither the resources nor the credibility to govern the region and would be helpless to combat the ethnic tensions and Islamist insurgents that would soon resurface.The traumatic violence that Mali has seen in recent months is largely the result of ethnic <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/29/ethnic-tensions-mali-troops-islamists"">tensions that Bamako was unable to combat. Ethnically, the northern stretches of the country—called Azawad by locals—are populated by the Tuaregs, who are a Berber people completely unrelated to the Niger-Congo ethnic groups of the south. Further, these southern groups take part in an age-old tradition called “<a href=""http://www.journaldumali.com/article.php?aid=967"">cousinage,” whereby each group is bound to the others by ancient familial ties. The Tuaregs, however, exist completely outside of this system.Already thus alienated from the rest of the country, the Tuaregs also live a lifestyle very <a href=""http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/111028/tuaregs-5-things-you-need-know"">distinct from that of their southern neighbors. A largely nomadic people, they claim that they are often ignored by the more agricultural south. Azawad is stricken with horrendous levels of poverty, even when compared to other regions of one of the poorest countries on Earth, and Azawadis have often claimed that Bamako is callous to their plight. As such, they have called for either independence or greater representation in the Malian government ever since Mali gained its independence from France.When Tuareg refugees <a href=""http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/111028/tuaregs-5-things-you-need-know"">streamed into Mali from Libya, bringing nationalist sentiments and heavy weaponry with them, the people of Azawad therefore embraced their calls for independence. They aligned themselves with Islamist groups such as Ansar Dine, which had broken off from Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and soon unilaterally declared <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881978"">independence. Once independence had been declared, however, the Islamist factions quickly moved to seize control of the region from Tuareg nationalist groups. They took city after city, imposing harsh Sharia law and destroying the shrines of Gao and Timbuktu. Within weeks, Azawad had become an Islamist shadow state where human rights were desecrated, adulterers were stoned, and women were attacked. The Malian armed forces attempted to launch a military campaign to retake the region, but they were rooted out by the Islamists and all but obliterated.Southern Mali, meanwhile, was experiencing its own version of tumult. In March 2012, the military staged a <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881978"">coup, claiming that only through deposing the civilian government could they effectively pacify the country. This coup was only the first of several undemocratic changes of government, and Bamako soon lost its reputation for democracy and human rights. None of the subsequent governments was able to quell the rebellion, and Mali descended into corruption and civil strife.
When France ultimately decided to intervene in the region, it did so specifically <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/11/france-intervene-mali-conflict"">because Bamako could not handle the situation itself. Today, Mali still <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/world/africa/mali-army-riding-us-hopes-is-proving-no-match-for-militants.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">lacks a competent standing army, and its government remains weak, authoritarian, and corrupt. Furthermore, both the Malian government and the Tuareg rebels are still <a href=""http://www.aim.org/newswire/tuareg-rebels-take-northern-town-leverage-to-negotiate-for-peace/"">fighting for leverage toward possible negotiations. Even though the Islamists have been driven out of Azawad, the factors that allowed them to seize control—ethnic tensions, an Islamist presence in West Africa, and an ineffective government in Bamako—remain in play. The government of Mali, itself a key component of the country’s problems, cannot be expected to ameliorate them on its own.If there is to be any peace in the region, therefore, France must maintain a peacekeeping force in Mali. If France leaves the region as it plans to do, it will leave a power vacuum that would soon be filled by the Islamist forces remaining in West Africa, who have already begun <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/world/africa/militants-infiltrate-towns-in-freed-areas-of-mali.html"">reasserting their presence in the country. Even barring that, the tensions between Azawad and the Malian government would inevitably lead to conflict. The United Nations has indicated that it may send a peacekeeping force as an alternative, but such endeavors have a long history of <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/892592.stm"">failure: Somalia, Srebrenica, and Rwanda stand as testaments to that.There are, of course, several reasons why France would be reluctant to maintain a long-term military presence in northern Mali—financial <a href=""http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2013/02/07/soixante-dix-millions-d-euros-c-est-le-prix-de-la-guerre-au-mali_1828077_3212.html"">cost, risk to French soldiers, and accusations of neo-colonialism among them. In exerting its military strength to liberate the region, however, France has already intimately involved itself in the situation. Unless the French government wants its efforts to be in vain, they will have to maintain a presence in Azawad, as peacekeepers, as nation-builders, and as bulwarks against the regional specter of radical Islamism.John A. Griffin ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Stoughton Hall.

The Harvard Dems will weigh in tonight on both the politics of the Commonwealth and a politically charged issue on Harvard's campus.The Harvard College Democrats plan to vote tonight to endorse a candidate vying to fill the Senate seat vacated earlier this month by new Secretary of State John F. Kerry. They will choose between two Democrats, U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of the Fifth Congressional District and Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of the Eighth Congressional District, who will face off in a primary set to occur on April 30.<!--more--> “It’s time for Harvard Progressives to formally exercise their voice, and the Senate race presents a clear choice,” Harvard Dems president Simon M. Thompson '14 said in a press release. Thompson added that a recent poll shows the race—once considered to be a Markey landslide—tightening.
 Whoever emerges on the Democratic side will almost surely be favored over the Republican nominee in the June 25 special election, according to recent polls. So far, only Daniel B. Winslow, the relatively unknown state representative from Norfolk, Mass., has entered the race for the Republicans.  The Harvard Dems' endorsement event is scheduled to occur this evening at 8 p.m. in Boylston 103. State Rep. Carl Sciortino, who represents neighborhoods in Medford and Somerville, will speak for the Markey campaign, while Braintree Mayor Joseph C. Sullivan will argue the case for Lynch, according to a statement released by the Harvard Dems on Saturday.The Harvard Dems will also vote whether to endorse Divest Harvard, a student campaign advocating divestment of University funds from the fossil fuel industry. Divestment became the official position of the Undergraduate Council following a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/17/raghuveer-wins-uc-race/"">College-wide referendum this past November.

A coalition of influential politicians, scientists, and medical researchers joined forces at a rally Monday to reaffirm the importance of medical research in the face of hundreds of millions of dollars in automatic federal sponsorship cuts which are set to take effect March 1.Enumerating the developments and cures made possible by federal sponsorship, the leaders warned that a roughly five percent cut to all non-military programs would be devastating to Boston’s hospitals and universities—including Harvard.Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who convened the rally at Boston Medical Center, called cuts to the National Institutes of Health a “mind-boggling” blow to urgent work. The NIH is the top distributer of federal funding for medical research.“There are sick people in this country, in this city, right now, literally fighting for their lives,” Menino said. “What keeps these patients fighting is hope. What keeps them living is science, and we can’t let Congress trample on both.”The rally was the highest-profile effort yet to bring together the region’s top researchers to lay out their case. Speeches from Menino, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Representative Michael E. Capuano, as well as researchers from the University of Massachusetts system, Joslin Diabetes Center, BMC, and Harvard Medical School centered on the societal value of health research in creating jobs, curing disease, and preventing death.
In a short speech, Warren warned specifically of slowed innovation, fewer jobs, and rising health care costs if research wanes in the absence of federal support.“We cannot say to our scientists fold up your work. We cannot say to young scientists, you can’t count on continuing support if you stay in the research field,” said Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor.“It makes no sense. We can’t build a future this way,” she added.Harvard Medical School Executive Dean of Research William W. Chin focused his remarks on the threat posed to basic research, which he said lays the groundwork for technological and medical innovation.Basic research is the bread and butter of Harvard Medical School labs, where more than $250 million in federal grants fueled hundreds of projects during the 2012 fiscal year.Harvard as a whole received almost $700 million in federal sponsorship for the fiscal year 2012 and could stand to lose millions of dollars earmarked for the current fiscal year and those to come if the sequester is not averted.Chin said many researchers already worn thin after a decade without growth in funding could be driven away from their work by further cuts.“The recent period of flat funding...has already put our scientists at risk, basic research at the fringe of knowledge at risk, and hence innovation at risk. Scientists are spending more time writing grant proposals and less in developing new ideas,” Chin said.“A generation of scientists could be lost in a period of profound funding reduction,” he added.Capuano, a member of the highly partisan House, said he expects Congress to reach a deal in the near future, but likely not before the March 1 deadline.Congress already acted once to delay the sequester—a self-imposed across-the-board budget cut to reduce the federal deficit—with a short-term compromise in January.Because Congress is in recess this week, any potential legislation to address the sequester will not be taken up for debate until next Monday.—Staff writer Nicholas P.

Some  groups of friends live together, breathe together, and succeed  together. But what happens when only one succeeds? This was the subject  explored in “pool (no water)” which played in Adams Pool Theater last  weekend. Written by British playwright Mark Ravenhill, the play centers  on a group of four artists and their former partner—referred to by the  other characters as “She”—who breaks away and finds success. The drama  begins in a hospital with the four friends taking care of the injured  but never-present fifth member of the group. Soon “She” becomes a  perversion of an art project as the four artists, consumed by jealousy  and resentment, exploit her condition for their own benefits.  Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “pool (no water)” is for  the most part thought-provoking and unsettling in its display of  uncensored emotion, although at times it stumbles in the face of its own  grandiosity.Written  as one long monologue and divided up into individual lines by the  actors, the play’s life is very much dependent on the choices of  director Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts editor. His clever use  of space and props bring an extra dimension to the production by toying  with and parodying the idea of self-reflective art. The audience sits on  the stage while the actors perform above them in the rows of seats.  What has become the stage is sparse, with only a black tarp, window, and  a film projector. This minimalist attitude and inversion of a  traditional stage setup makes it very apparent that the characters in  the play, who are never named, are very conscious that they are creating  a work of art, twisted and self-indulgent. It is art within art, and  the result is both frustrating and satisfying.Yet,  at times, the production’s quest for that extra dimension comes off  heavy-handed and overwrought, which contrasts with the otherwise subtle  nature of McTaggart’s directorial choices. The characters film  themselves throughout the play as if making a pseudo-documentary, with  their images shown on the projection above. The use of the camera is  successful most of the time and contributes to the concept of art within  art. However, occasionally the camera use is overdone; it came up too  often in moments when the characters were trying to convey emotions, or  without any apparent pattern. Many times, though, McTaggart gets it  right, to wondrous results—there is one scene in which the actors used  the microphone wire as an IV when manipulating their friend’s body to  take an unattractive photo. Because this fifth friend is never played by  any actor and instead fleshed out by the words of the other four,  scenes like these help define the relationships between the five. The  result is startling, and it’s thanks to these smaller, unexpected  choices that the more self-conscious artistic choices, like the camera,  are balanced out.The  actors are given the challenging task of bringing the play to life  through the movement and rhythm of their speech, and they achieve this  with varying degrees of success. The ensemble, consisting of Alistair A.  Debling ’16, Anna A. Hagen ’15, John L. Pizzato ’16, and Sara K.  Rosenburg ’16, is able to develop and retain the feeling of  self-loathing and franticness that bubbles under the surface of their  characters. The rhythm of their words is particularly powerful when the  group attempts to destroy the friend’s next art project by deleting  photos while chanting “select and delete” at a crescendo. The actors  display an emotional vulnerability through the beat of their words and  frustration with their predicament.There  is a sense that there are no distinctive characters in “pool (no  water),” but rather fragments and pieces of one; it is up to each actor  to decide how to parse the script so that individual characters emerge  from the undifferentiated body of the text. The actors’ movement,  however, feels too unwieldy and heavy at times, breaking the illusion  that the actors move as one. They do not retain the same smooth, clean  lines, and therefore the cohesion of the group is shattered by the  disjointed physicality. There are scenes that call for a seamless  connection of their bodies to express the codependency of its actors.  Sometimes their movements fall flat, the tension and awkwardness  evident. Separately, though, the actors put on a fine show, moving their  bodies with a tightness that is appropriate for their characters.
The  fantastic script of “pool (no water)” brings the show together; it is  witty and darkly introspective in a way that can hide some of the minor  deficiencies of the production. Despite some of the faults, the  production is a worthy, if ambitious, performance thanks to its director  and the passionate actors. There are real moments of unrelenting  emotion that surprises the audience with its ferocity, though there are  occasional bouts of inconsistency.—Staff writer Neha Mehrotra can be reached at nehamehrotra@college.harvard.edu.

Does seeing another country from a distance constitute foreign policy experience? Is refudiate a word? Is North Korea one of America's allies?

Less than seven years after the faculty <a href=""http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/12.14/99-deas.html"">voted to form the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences from the old Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, SEAS has exhibited remarkable growth. In the past year alone, the number of undergraduate concentrators at SEAS has <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/13/cs-seas-more-concentrators/"">grown by 20 percent. Some concentrations, like computer science, have more than <a href=""http://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k88702&amp;pageid=icb.page516400"">doubled in the past five years. At the end of the 2011 fiscal year, SEAS <a href=""http://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-seas/facts-history"">brought in $44.6 million for sponsored research, up <a href=""http://www.seas.harvard.edu/annual_report_09-10/financial-statments"">nearly 21 percent from 2008.SEAS has shown incredible potential to bring in students and sponsor research, and now it needs room to grow. SEAS Professor David A. Weitz <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/seas-moves-allston-square/"">told The Crimson earlier this month that “SEAS is crowded, there’s no space. We can’t do research, we can’t teach.” Meanwhile, Harvard has <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/5/26/allston-harvards-harvard-work/"">left undeveloped land and a halted construction project in Allston. The University’s <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/6/seas-move-allston-campus/"">plan to move SEAS across the river will give SEAS the space it needs to prosper while revitalizing Allston.The SEAS expansion gives Harvard the opportunity to make good on its promise not to abandon Allston. Harvard’s <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/allston-task-campus-services/"">troubled relationship with the Allston community is due in large part to the abandoned and changing plans left in the wake of the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/12/11/allston-university-halt-construction/"">halted Allston Science Complex construction project. The new facilities that will support SEAS have the potential to breathe new life into the area. Hundreds, if not thousands, of students, faculty, and support staff will come to Allston on a daily basis, and new shops and restaurants will spring up to serve them. Harvard initiatives including the Innovation Lab and Education Portal in Allston have already created a model for long-term, mutually beneficial relationships between Harvard and the Allston community.Yet for all the potential this move has, the University needs to resolve serious logistical issues before a single brick is laid. It would take over half an hour to walk from the Radcliffe Quad to the site of the proposed development. The shuttle from Allston to Harvard Square takes at least <a href=""http://www.campusservices.harvard.edu/transit-fleet/morning-afternoon-monday-friday"">ten minutes. How would a student with an 11 a.m. class in Allston make it to class in the Yard by 12:07 p.m.? What happens to the professors who regularly collaborate in person, both formally and informally, with their Faculty of Arts and Sciences colleagues?The move to Allston is an opportunity that comes with great risks. At a minimum, moving SEAS to Allston will more than double the physical span of the undergraduate campus. If Harvard can crack the problem of collaboration across distances and unifying a campus spread out across a long distance, the move will be a success. A student in an engineering class should not have to factor in extra time to go to or return from class. The true measure of success for students and faculty will be whether it is feasible, through enhanced shuttle schedules or other transportation options, to go from a class in Harvard Yard to a class in Allston in seven minutes.
These challenges cannot be taken lightly. SEAS faculty are angry that they have not been consulted on the move, and the University has taken the position that the logistical issues can be sorted out later. That position, however, neglects that the logistical issues will dictate the success or failure of this move. We are excited that SEAS will have the opportunity to grow and innovate in a new space across the river, but it will be a pyrrhic victory if SEAS becomes isolated as a result.

When Eleanor T. Regan ’13 found herself alone in her apartment in Freiberg, Germany, with a defunct light bulb and limited knowledge of German, she turned to the first logical resource she could think of: Google Translate. After a week of leaving Post-It notes on her landlord’s door begging for a new light bulb, she was surprised at the lack of response.“It was so stressful and frustrating. I can’t tell you how upsetting it was to not be able to communicate with this woman,” she said. “But  it was one of those moments that never would have happened at Harvard. It’s ridiculous to assume we’ll always live in a place where everything will be served to us.”Regan, a Social Studies concentrator and former Crimson arts editor, studied abroad in Freiburg through the Harvard College Europe Program during the spring semester of her junior year. The light bulb incident was just one of countless situations that she says changed her outlook on living in the real world. Like Regan, many students at Harvard find studying abroad during the academic term a life-changing experience—one that teaches not only practical life skills but also broadens perspectives beyond the scope of Harvard’s classrooms.“Studying abroad made me see the limitless possibility of things and just the pure power of imagination,” says Jinzhao Wang ’14, who also traveled to Freiburg last spring as a sophomore. “When I look back I could almost start crying because I learned so much.”Yet despite the unique experience offered by study abroad, many undergraduates are still reluctant to leave behind aspects of college life—extracurriculars, friends, and House culture—in order to start anew in a foreign environment.
In the past decade, interest in study abroad has risen and fallen. Eleven years ago, during the 2001-2002 academic year, just 100 undergraduates engaged in term time study abroad, according to data from Harvard’s Office of International Education. That number grew to 242 by 2006-2007, but has since declined to 141 students during the 2010-2011 school year.But many students who have studied abroad strongly believe that their experiences are ones that every Harvard student should have—and that any reason to avoid leaving Cambridge is an opportunity squandered.“There are very few times in our life where taking an insane, crazy risk is viable. When else am I going to be able to go live in a country where I can’t speak the language and not have to hold down a job or pay rent?” Regan says.  “When else are we going to be put into that scenario where it’s so feasible, possible, safe?”THE WORLD’S A CLASSROOMStudents recite an exhaustive list of positive experiences when asked about their time abroad.“Studying abroad has been the most important thing I’ve done on a personal level, intellectual level, and just in terms of life in general,” says Miriam E. Psychas ’13, a joint history and literature and sociology concentrator who spent a semester in Cuba during her junior year. “Literally my college experience for me is divided in terms of pre-Cuba and post-Cuba.”Whether traveling to the seat of industrialization in Europe or enduring the heat of Africa, participants say they find that leaving the confines of Harvard’s campus actually strengthens their academic purpose.“As the world is becoming ever more globalized, as change is the new norm, I really feel people should take time studying abroad, actually taking a few classes with people around the world,” says Wang. “Traveling later on in life is different from studying with people your own age.”Studying abroad can also provide students with a chance to encounter and learn from real world obstacles that may not be a factor on Harvard’s campus.“I sometimes feel like Harvard hands us a lot of things... The website is easy to use. There’s no way to not get housing. It’s very hard to fail out,” says Regan. “It was great living with people in a place that wasn’t holding my hand.”

A female undergraduate reported being assaulted in the Quincy House courtyard early Monday morning, according to an advisory emailed by the Harvard University Police Department to members of the Harvard community.At 1:35 a.m., the student was grabbed by two males who tried to pull her towards a nearby building, she told police. She fought off the assailants and escaped the courtyard without injury, but police were unable to find the suspects, according to the advisory.The email stated that HUPD has increased its presence in the area and encouraged anyone with knowledge of the incident to tell HUPD’s criminal investigation division.The notice also asked University affiliates to be mindful of Harvard’s “urban setting,” to be vigilant day and night, and to travel in groups and on well-lit pathways without distraction from phones or earbuds after dark.HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to provide information about the incident beyond that contained in the advisory.
Quincy House resident Carina R. Fish ’13 said that she was surprised to hear about the reported assault and is concerned about the safety of Quincy courtyard. She said she was worried in particular because Quincy courtyard has two unlocked entrances and is “one of the few courtyards that are open past a certain time.”It has been six months since HUPD released an advisory alerting the Harvard community about an assault. The most recent advisories came in August, when two separate reports of rape, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/10/woman-allegedly-raped-in-harvard-yard/"">the first in Harvard Yard and <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/17/rape-reported-second-five-days/"">the second near Oxford and Kirkland Streets, came within the span of five days.Monday’s advisory came only minutes before the House Masters and resident dean of Lowell House, which is across the street from Quincy courtyard, emailed the House about two alleged crimes that both took place this weekend. The email detailed the theft of the House banner from Lowell dining hall and the vandalization of a bronze bust that sits in Lowell courtyard between entrways D and E. The statue, which depicts abolitionist poet James Russell Lowell and was on loan from the Harvard Art Museums, was removed from its pedestal and deposited into a trash can, which apparently tipped over, spilling the statue and garbage onto the ground.Officials have released no evidence to suggest that the assault in Quincy courtyard and thetheft and vandalization in Lowell were related.“This was not a harmless prank,” wrote Lowell House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck and acting resident dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03. “This was a crime.”They added that HUPD is investigating and asked anyone who saw the theft to speak up.“We are assuming that this act was not committed by someone in Lowell House but by someone outside our community,” the administrators wrote.“We also assume that a group of people didn’t try to steal a massive piece of bronze without anyone in the house seeing it,” they added.—Staff writer Samuel Y.

In fact, the bust was located between entryways D and E, not between entryways D and C.

“My  spirits hang as heavy as the testicles on an old horse” is not a line  we might attribute to Shakespeare. Yet this striking line is exactly the  sort of dialogue that playwright Robert Brustein has imagined for an  aging Bard, whom he depicts in his latest play, “The Last Will.” Suffolk  University and Commonwealth Shakespeare Company debuted the play on  Wednesday at the Modern Theatre, where it will play until Feb. 24. It  takes a certain sort of writerly confidence for a playwright to put  words in the mouth of Shakespeare, but Brustein, who is the  distinguished scholar in residence at Suffolk, has done it twice before;  “The Last Will” is the final installment in a trilogy that depicts  Shakespeare in different stages of his life. Dark,  self-aware, and ultimately sanguine, “The Last Will” presents a more  complicated portrait of the man behind the name. Shakespeare (Allyn  Burrows) returns to his wife of over two decades, Anne Hathaway (Brooke  Adams), on the heels of a great loss: the famous Globe Theatre, where  his works were staged, has just burned down. With rapidly faltering  health and lucidity, the writer intends to make amends.No  one is above reproach in Brustein’s depiction of Stratford-upon-Avon;  Shakespeare’s daughters (Stacy Fischer and Merritt Janson) squabble for  his affection and inheritance like the characters Goneril and Regan in  “King Lear.” Fearing unfaithfulness, Shakespeare makes plans to change  his last will in order to disinherit his wife. Indeed, the play is rife  with riffs on the word “will”; it is used first as the main character’s  name, then to mean a legal document and as a term describing his burning  writerly passion. “I’ve lost the will to write,” Will laments. The  world’s most famous playwright is here shown taken down to a humble size  by self-doubt, writer’s block, paranoia, and perhaps syphilis;  Brustein’s Shakespeare is not your AP English class’s portrait of the  writer.Brustein  and director Steven Maler naturally weave comparisons between  Shakespeare’s family and the characters he created in his many plays. As  Shakespeare hurtles towards the final stages of a fatal illness, he  begins to conflate characters from his plays with the real people in his  life. “I feel you mock me, Gertrude,” he says to his wife, confusing  her with Hamlet’s mother. 
Shakespeare’s  works are not only alluded to; they are directly quoted in the  performance, often by characters who mock Will by throwing his own  well-known lines back at him. Upon being accused of adultery by her  truant husband, Anne tosses back a reconstruction of the classic Hamlet  line “frailty thy name is woman”: “Appetite thy name is man,” she  challenges. The language is modern but formal, starched. Much  of the success of the play comes from the mature and carefully  controlled acting of Adams and Burrows. Adams, as Anne, provides the  sass and wit that challenges Shakespeare’s 17th-century representation  of frail and unfaithful women. Brustein’s Anne is a sassy verbal  sparring partner for Shakespeare’s rough patriarch.The  stark, minimalist set design by Eric Levenson—consisting principally of  a couple of curtains and some beer stains and pub accessories—is in  direct contrast with costume designer Nancy Leary’s ornate,  Elizabethan-era clothing. The theater at Suffolk University is notably  small in scale and intimate in design, with audience members within  arm’s reach of the cast. The combined effect is one of making a great  man more human-sized.Yet  for all its attempts to present Shakespeare the man over Shakespeare  the myth, the play does not stray far from a wide-eyed admiration of  him—in repeating  his more famous lines, other characters remind the  audience of the long-lasting success of Will’s plays. Modern viewers  also might take issue with the historical accuracy of the play’s  depictions or the unrealistic enthusiasm Shakespeare has for fixing his  family.While  works of art surrounding Shakespeare can at times stand on their own as  pieces of art, “The Last Will” suggests that they remain testaments to  the creative powers of a literary great. In the final line of the show,  Brustein writes, “His legacy he bequeathed to us all…whose benefactors  are as numerous as the stars.” It seems that at least in the realm of  theater, the works of Shakespeare are a gift that keeps giving.—Staff writer Ola Topczewska can be reached at atopczewska@college.harvard.edu.

<span style=""font-size: 10px;"">During their general meeting on Sunday, representatives of the Undergraduate Council discussed programming ideas for a small-scale “Junior Week” which is slated to take place Thursday through Saturday on Junior parents weekend.The program is meant to serve as a pilot for what the UC hopes will become an annual event for juniors.“Community building happens a lot in houses, at the beginning of freshman year, and the end of senior year, but it doesn’t happen that frequently throughout your time here, especially sophomore year and junior year.” UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said.Some events that are being planned for the week include a “Ted Talks”-style event featuring juniors, a ice skating night at Harvard Skate, and a group outing to a Harvard women’s hockey game on March 2.The UC is discussing potential collaboration options with various other student organizations like Harvard Student Agencies and Harvard Speaks. In addition, the Council is seeking a financial partnership with the COOP to provide giveaways and food.
In addition to discussions about Junior Week, the UC considered student group funding proposals during the meeting.The UC Finance Committee rejected grant proposals by the Harvard African Students Association and the Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association in the final grants package presented at the general meeting.HASA’s grant proposal was rejected because the grant would have been used to fund an event that was only open to members of the club and not to the full undergraduate community, which is a requirement for UC grants. The HUMA grant was rejected because it would have been used to fund outside labor.“Since all the money is paid by students and we want the money to return to students, we can’t fund a professional,” said treasurer Jonathan Y. Li ’14.The final $30,201.78 grants package was passed by unanimous consent.The Undergraduate Council also voted 26-4 on an act urging the administration to “initiate the process of restoring the [Memorial Church] bell to ringing condition.”The historic bell has remained out of commission ever since a crack was discovered more than a year ago. Since then, the hourly bell sounds have been produced using a speaker and a recording.In response to a question about the timeframe for fixing the bell, Adams representative Antone Martinho ’13 said that the University’s lack of a timeline was precisely the problem he wanted to tackle with the legislation.“Part of this is we are encouraging them to initiate the process without any further delay,” Martinho said.—Staff writer Steven S.

Centering around a Princeton University admissions officer,  “Admission,” an upcoming film starring Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, will  strike anyone who has ever applied to a highly selective university as  all too familiar. In the film, directed by Paul Weitz, Fey plays Portia  Nathan, an admissions officer who encounters Jeremiah, an eccentric yet  intellectually gifted prospective applicant from an alternative high  school. Jeremiah has a slim chance of getting into Princeton, but Portia  soon learns that he might be the son she gave up for adoption years  ago.Inquisitive parents and applicants with long lists of extraordinary  achievements populate the film, giving  viewers a sense of the  obsessive effort that is poured into the tens of thousands of  application packets that arrive in offices like Portia’s every year.  Anyone who has successfully gone through the college application process  will likely laugh at the pitch-perfect depiction of parental  anxiousness and at the portrayal of overachievers vying for coveted  acceptances. But students still wrapped up in the process—especially  those counting down the days until April 1—might be further discouraged  by the visual representation of the impossible odds of landing a spot in  a “dream school” and disheartened by the apparent well-rounded  flawlessness of an ideal applicant.“Admission” captures the draining and sometimes panic-inducing  process of  Ivy League admissions, but the film is about much more than  that. During a press conference in New York City on Feb. 8, director  Paul Weitz said that although the film is set in one of the nation’s top  universities, it is not meant to serve as a laudatory celebration of  the Ivy League.  “I personally don’t think it matters where you go to  college. It’s about who you come across when you’re there. You can come  out of a great school having been undereducated in the most important  things in life,” he said. The film, similarly, is about how the  trajectory of someone’s life, regardless of how carefully planned out,  can be completely altered by people they encounter and with whom they  connect.Audience members may see some of themselves in Jeremiah (Nat  Wolff), and Wolff’s own experience in filming for “Admission” was a  classic case of art imitating life: he is a second-semester high school  senior who, like Jeremiah, is preparing to decide where to spend the  next four years of his life. Wolff met with his college adviser just  three days after reading the script, and at the press conference, he  described his anxiety over his own college applications.The films marks a more dramatic role for Fey, who prior to this  film starred in NBC’s “30 Rock” and the 2010 comedy “Date Night” with  Steve Carell. For the film’s stars, though, more important than  assigning the film to a specific genre was conveying the complex set of  emotions in each scene. According to Fey, the approach was to draw out the elements of  comedy and drama in each scene and depict those moments as honestly as  possible. “It’s a human and heartfelt story, and you just try to play  the tone that seems to be presenting itself on the page,” she said.
Paul Rudd plays John Pressman, an administrator at Jeremiah’s high  school, and he also spoke at the conference about the unique  opportunities offered by a film with elements of both comedy and drama.  “Comedy is an effective means of conveying something dramatic. Life is  funny, life is dramatic, and those tend to be my favorite kinds of  stories,” he said. Weitz noted that to balance these elements successfully, comedy  needs to emerge from the drama organically. A good movie will balance  both naturally, he said. “The characters don’t know they’re being funny  in any good comedy. The most fun thing is seeing a character emerge and  to have actors walking that line [between comedy and drama].”For all involved, the film seems to have been an enjoyable and  cooperative effort. Filming on location at Princeton was permitted,  which provided cast members with some of their favorite scenes. During  the press conference, Fey said that one of her most memorable scenes was  one in which her character stomps around campus in aggravation, but her  tantrum is juxtaposed by the jaunty background music provided by a  Princeton a capella group—which she encounters and pushes past in the  middle of their song.This combination of light-hearted humor and emotion is a defining  component of the film—“Admission” deals with the often-harrowing journey  of applying to college with both levity and realism. The cast hopes the  setting and the subject matter of the film will strike a chord with  both the hopeful high-schoolers and the college constituents in the  audience.—Staff writer Galila M. Gray can be reached at <a href=""mailto:ggray14@college.harvard.edu"">ggray14@college.harvard.edu.

Kenyatta Smith had a monster weekend for Harvard men's basketball, almost netting the first triple-double in school history and earning this week’s top honors. However, in a great week for Harvard sports fans, three other Crimson athletes put in impressive performances.

Women’s squash beat Trinity to clinch the national championship this week for the 14th time in program history. Sobhy has dominated competition for the past two years and in the deciding match this week she was up against Kanzy El Defrawy, the only player to ever even take a game from Sobhy in her career when the two met earlier in the season. There was to be no repeat this time as Sobhy dispatched the freshman, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8, taking Harvard to the top of the college arena.
 
DJ White, Men’s Volleyball
Penn State came to Harvard riding a 51-game conference win streak and a No. 9 ranking in the country. Expecting a comfortable win, they were instead shocked by the Crimson, led by sophomore DJ White, who produced arguably their biggest win of all time and their first ever over the Nittany Lions. White was dominant with 13 kills and a killing percentage of .500 in a superlative performance.
 
Steven Keith, Men’s Wrestling
After senior Walter Peppelman recently became the seventh wrestler in Crimson history to achieve 100 career wins, this week Steven Keith followed suit. The senior went a perfect 2-0 with his 100th and 101st victories over Brown and Boston University, respectively, this week, cementing his place on the all-time list.

Sherman McCoy, the testy, testosterone-filled 1980’s bond salesman of Tom Wolfe’s Bonfire of the Vanities, frequently calls himself a “Master of the Universe.” The Master of the Universe is a demigod above the law of us plebeians, egotistically immersed in a life of conspicuous consumption and addicted to the adrenaline-fueled machismo of making billion dollar bets.Thankfully, McCoy is a frightful fiction—our country’s laws prevent such impertinence. “The United States maintains one of the strongest and most effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes of the world,” David S. Cohen of the Treasury Department <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg76061/html/CHRG-112shrg76061.htm"">assured the nation.So when it was discovered that HSBC <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/gangster-bankers-too-big-to-jail-20130214"">knowingly laundered for ruthless drug cartels and Russian mobsters, transacted with blackballed organizations that bankrolled Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda, and helped Iran and North Korea evade sanctions, our robust regulatory agencies sounded the bank’s death knell. Right?Given all the corporations-are-people bluster in the air—and that breathing in the same vicinity as Al-Qaeda, let alone moving billions of dollars for it, are possible grounds for placement on President Obama’s <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=1&amp;hp"">kill list and an eventual zapping-from-the-sky—didn’t our Very Tough Officials press severe criminal charges? HSBC will surely lose its banking license, right?Wrong.
Not one person behind the decade-long, mind-bogglingly heinous crimes of HSBC will spend a single day in jail. Not one person at HSBC who provided one billion dollars to the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18880269"">terrorist-linked Al-Rajhi bank in Saudi Arabia, or who <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-11/world/35767206_1_stuart-gulliver-hsbc-traffickers"">washed the blood from the hundreds of millions of dollars coming from Mexico’s Sinaloa and Colombia’s Norte del Valle drug cartels, will have to personally pay a single dollar.Instead the Department of Justice issued a fine for <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-hsbc-probe-idUSBRE8BA05M20121211"">$1.9 billion—about five weeks’ worth of profit.The new normal of banking is a pattern of massive fraud encouraged—er, punished—by these impotent wrist slaps. Profits are privatized among the shareholders, and losses are subsidized by the taxpaying shmucks. Now, congressional Republicans want to do away with the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/12/republicans-volcker-rule_n_2666946.html"">Volcker Rule so that banks can gamble with their clients’ money too.There is an epidemic of amnesia when it comes to bank regulation in Washington.

Bending over backwards for the banks, Congress expressed little outrage regarding the HSBC settlement. And less than two weeks after the HSBC settlement came the announcement that UBS was <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324407504578188342618724274.html"">getting away with rate-rigging LIBOR for a measly $1.5 billion.Basically, a bunch of bankers from <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324432004578302164058534372.html"">prestigious financial institutions like Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland colluded to distort the LIBOR index to misrepresent the strength of their banks and make their trades more lucrative. The problem is that LIBOR is a crucial determinant in the prices of hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets—any imaginable financial instrument, from college loans to credit cards to mortgages, was artificially distorted to help traders make a few extra dollars on their deals.In an encouraging change of pace, Senator Elizabeth A. Warren exposed the farcical power of the Very Tough Officials by asking a simple <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-elizabeth-warren-bank-regulators-jail-20130218,0,4352717.story"">question: “Tell me a little bit about the last few times you've taken the biggest financial institutions on Wall Street all the way to a trial.""The silence was telling. Eventually, Thomas J. Curry, Comptroller of the Currency, mumbled the disheartening, but illuminating, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/17/wall-street-warren-video_n_2707016.html"">admission that “we do not have to bring people to trial.”Petulant Congressmen stonewall attempted reforms to the banking system, shredding any legislation into a large, postmodern hodgepodge of exemptions. Warren’s brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been repeatedly stymied by Senate Republicans who refuse to confirm any of the president’s nominees for its directorship.After watering down regulatory laws to the point of irrelevance, Republicans like Senator Marco A. Rubio have the audacity to <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-marco-rubios-state-union-response/story?id=18484413"">claim “a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies.”Apparently, financial institutions engorged themselves on toxic, predatory mortgage deals at the behest of the government, when George W. Bush was still in office. Rubio and the Republicans are endorsing a sort of voodoo economics that is completely counter to the facts—maybe there’s something in the water?There’s an appalling inequality of justice in this country. In the eyes of the government, fraudsters like HSBC and UBS are clearly exempt from the laws. Too big to fail has become too big to jail.

In Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis,” a salesman named Gregor Samsa finds himself transformed into a giant beetle. The human-turned-arthropod despairs at his inability to leave bed for work, and he struggles to master his new physique. Though Gregor’s family is dismayed by the event, his parents submit to their son’s fate. Rather than seek a cure for Gregor or wonder at the root of his metamorphosis, they handle the beetle at a distance, doling out empathy until their disbelief turns to anger. Eventually, Gregor’s disgusted father beats back the roaming insect with apples—one of which remains painfully lodged inside Gregor’s shell. By the end of the story, Gregor’s beloved sister insists that the family purge the beetle from their home.Reading “The Metamorphosis” this summer was my first encounter with Kafka. I was subletting an apartment from a couple who had “The Metamorphosis” on their bookshelf, and I pulled out the novella on a weeknight when the New York humidity left me lazing next to their fan. I was less troubled reading about Gregor’s transformation than about his family’s reaction, which haunted me first in its resignation and then in its cruelty. Why did his parents so helplessly accept their son’s misfortune? How could they not ask questions? Why did their aversion to the beetle override their empathy? I realized that in Kafka’s literary Coliseum—my metaphor for the author’s strange, bleak arena in which surreal events overtake innocent characters—the victim is only half the spectacle. The audience, sitting back and watching the unbelievable unfold, becomes its own unsettling display. I closed the book, but my discomfort lingered.Later that night, I opened my laptop. My news feed flashed with headlines: “Gunman turns ‘Batman’ screening into real-life ‘horror film.’” “Shooting Rampage at ‘Dark Knight Rises’ Showing in Colorado.” “‘Dark Knight Rises’ shooting ranks among the worst massacres in U.S. history.” I learned that a man named James Holmes had dyed his hair red, claimed to be the Joker, and shot over 60 people in a movie theater screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” at midnight. Dressed in head-to-toe tactical gear, he threw tear gas grenades into the aisles and fired at random as the audience screamed in terror.Was this reality? I could almost feel Kafka’s Coliseum rising up around Aurora as though summoned from the author’s literary depths. I began to grasp that in our historical moment, a shooter can costume himself as a superhero villain and blast Batman fans with ammunition. The surrealism of the episode sent shudders down my spine. I followed the news as politicians and journalists veered their conversations toward gun control, and I wondered what type of tragic audience we Americans would prove to be.Kafkaesque events continued to transpire through fall. In October, I watched footage of Hurricane Sandy—the cyclone that meteorologists called “Frankenstorm”—rip front walls from apartment buildings, hurl beach houses into water, repurpose taxis into the likes of yellow minnows, and send 7,000 U.S. citizens into emergency shelters. Barely two months later, I read about the Sandy Hook shootings. First-graders huddled in storage rooms, in bathrooms, and under desks as their friends endured bullets from the murderer’s Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle. The victims’ bodies were so mutilated that police hesitated to let parents see their shot children.
Each of these incidents left America in shock. It was as if crime and environmental change had morphed into the paranormal. President Obama called for a gun violence task force. New Yorkers debated the prospect of building a sea wall. I started getting daily email requests to sign gun control petitions, and I tracked Facebook updates from volunteers fundraising for hurricane relief.Through all the chaos, I found myself returning to “The Metamorphosis.” Kafka’s story gave me a touchstone for reflecting on our society’s reaction to these events. Having already thought through the dangers of resignation, I felt proud that so many people were taking action.At the same time, casting these tragedies in a Kafkaesque light also added nuance to my evaluation. I became more aware of our diverse coping mechanisms. Some of us do resemble Gregor’s family. We turn away from painful situations, accept our powerlessness, or let our resentment grow larger than our will for change. Perhaps these impulses are essentially human. Perhaps they deserve compassion, or perhaps they do not. The question I keep coming back to is: if your child’s life was inexplicably damaged—if he went to the movies and experienced a shooting, or if a storm destroyed his home—how would you try to overcome this fate?—Columnist Stephanie L.

Ben T. Zauzmer '15, an Applied Math concentrator in Mather House, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-zauzmer/"">gained Internet fame last year for his strikingly accurate <a href=""http://oscarforecast.wordpress.com/"">predictions of who would win the 2012 Oscars. This year, he's at it again.Using results from similar awards shows, critics' picks, and other available data, Zauzmer runs statistical analyses to determine the probability that nominated movies, directors, or actresses will win in their given categories this Sunday. Flyby sat down with Zauzmer to talk movies and math.<!--more--> Flyby: How long have you been interested in the Oscars?
BZ: My interest in the Oscars goes back many years, although last year was the first time I tried to predict the Oscars with math. Last year went well. [I got] all 8 of the major categories [and] 15 out of 20 overall. Flyby: What are your predictions for this year?BZ: For Best Picture right now it's ""Argo"" at 60%. I don't use personal predictions, just math. For Best Director it's Ang Lee for ""Life of Pi,"" and then the acting awards are: Daniel Day Lewis for ""Lincoln,"" and Jennifer Lawrence from ""Silver Linings Playbook."" For Best Supporting Actor, it's Harvard's own Tommy Lee Jones '69. That's going to be a little closer, with Christoph Waltz from ""Django Unchained"" being a close second. And then Anne Hathaway is the runaway favorite, mathematically, for Best Supporting Actress [in ""Les Misérables""].  Flyby: How do you get the data for these predictions?BZ: A lot of time spent on the Internet, on MetaCritic, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Wikipedia, the websites of different guild awards, the Oscars' website, etc., gathering it all, throwing it in Excel, then using Excel and Mathematica and Stata to actually come up with the formulas. Much of it this year was done over winter break. I had a wonderful break gathering data about movies and watching movies.  Flyby: How has it been having your predictions garner a lot of press?BZ: It's been a lot of fun, people from all over the world have been interested. I think a lot of people are on there because they're filling out their own Oscar polls this weekend, they want to give it their best shot. I know last year at Harvard, some kid entered his freshman dorm's Oscar pool. He won after using my picks, and he gave me a bar of chocolate that he had won. So that's always fun.

Last week, the Internet exploded with the latest wave of backlash against HBO series “Girls.” The Feb. 10 episode, “One Man’s Trash,” featured creator and producer Lena Dunham’s character Hannah engaging in a sexual escapade with an older, handsome stranger, played by a guest-starring Patrick Wilson. Amid controversy over how the unconventionally attractive Hannah could possibly snag such a nice-looking man, I’d like to say the following: Thank you, Lena Dunham. Since its premiere in 2012, “Girls” has been both acclaimed and derided, with much criticism focusing on the show’s representation of class privilege. Personally, I’ve never understood this line of attack. Yes, the show explores the lives of privileged women, but it never claims to do otherwise. Critics in this camp seem under the impression that “Girls” wants to represent its generation and fails to do so by focusing on only one specific subset. But at the moment when Hannah utters the widely reprinted quote that instigated this misconception—“I think I may be the voice of my generation. Or at least a voice, of a generation”—she is on drugs, begging for money on the floor of her parents’ hotel room. Her proclamation is ironic. “Girls” aims to speak only for the world it depicts—one of privileged, highly educated, under-skilled twenty-somethings with strong yet vague desires to pursue art—and does so, for the most part, with startling acuity.But what has puzzled me the most about the discussions of privilege surrounding “Girls” has been the absence of dialogue about Hannah’s atypical Hollywood appearance. While I do think that the complex rendering of the show’s characters is progressive in itself, on the most surface level, it’s true that the experiences of wealthy white people in New York is not new territory for television. However, focusing on a female protagonist that lacks typical body privilege is.Historically, women have been valued for their status as physical objects. This underlying idea buoys the narratives of countless film and television shows. In romantic comedies, for example, girls undergo makeovers to become conventionally attractive before men will date them. We internalize the idea that women must look a very specific way in order to be loved.So when “Girls” introduced an alternatively attractive protagonist with the same confidence and romantic prospects as any Hollywood ingénue, I welcomed the breath of fresh air. But as exemplified by last week’s reactions, audiences consistently criticize this aspect of the show for its supposed lack of realism, as opposed to praising it for its truthfulness. Never do these conversations acknowledge that the point of view that finds Hannah’s love life unviable is largely shaped by film and television that propagates partnership standards much less realistic than those depicted on “Girls.”The dichotomy in perceived attractiveness levels—as illuminated by Dunham and Wilson—provokes such criticism but doesn’t seem to hold up for the opposite gender paradigm, and many saw last week’s episode as Lena Dunham’s response to this reality. We frequently see films in which men with offbeat looks pursue classically attractive women: Woody Allen dates Diane Keaton; Seth Rogen dates Katherine Heigl. These actors’ characters are loved as full packages with personalities, regardless of their lack of traditional handsomeness. Dunham’s tryst with Patrick Wilson is just a gender reversal of the same trope.
However, claiming this is be the episode’s main feat undersells “Girls.” Yes, Dunham is reversing a common stereotype. Yes, she is responding to untruthful claims that “Girls” who look like Hannah can’t date classically attractive men. But she also is actively changing the landscape that gives birth to the points of view that find these depictions unrealistic in the first place. Younger generations will watch television shows like “Girls” and likeminded contemporaries like “Broad City” and see three-dimensional female characters with different looks, shapes, and sizes experiencing fully realized love lives. They will internalize the idea that this is a reality that can happen, just as the generation before them so clearly internalized that it was not. Close-minded notions of who can date whom will begin to expand.Like almost any television show, “Girls” has its flaws. But it’s also a huge progressive step in the body politics of television. If future shows take up what “Girls” has done well but also rectify its shortfalls by putting together people not just of different sizes and sexual orientations, but also of different races, creeds, and other variations not readily explored on television, the viewing public of the future will change. There won’t be a large audience claiming certain romantic combinations ring false, because all will be represented both in reality and on screen. Let’s own up to the fact that television can shape the way we think—let’s allow it to make progressive strides so that our brains can, too.—Columnist Lily F. Karlin can be reached at lily.karlin@college.harvard.edu.

Can you remember the last time somebody trolled you?If not, perhaps you’re not familiar with the word “troll,” as in the slang verb form “to troll.” This usage derives from another, narrower meaning of “troll” that emerged out of the proliferation of online chat rooms and web forums circa the ’90s, which Wikipedia defines as “Someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as a forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.”As with other popular internet slang, trolls and trolling have migrated from the virtual into the real. It’s relatively common to hear of people “getting trolled” in everyday life, which I would define as being deliberately misled and thereby humiliated or made upset. Not all trolling is created equal: most trolling, like slipping a fake anonymous love letter under your roommate’s door on Valentine’s Day, is generally harmless. Other forms of trolling, however, can border on harassment and possibly be subject to legal action.Although trolling is becoming an increasingly mainstream phenomenon of contemporary youth culture, be apprised that the practice has been around since ancient times. It’s also important to note that being smart isn’t enough to avoid being trolled—even people like Plato got trolled from time to time. Case in point: An apocryphal story goes that Plato once offered Socrates an elegantly concise definition of man as a “featherless biped,” to which Diogenes of Sinope, an essentially homeless philosopher and troll par excellence, replied by offering Plato a de-feathered chicken, i.e., a new member of mankind.Of the different realms in which the art of trolling takes place, the arts may be most insidiously affected because of how difficult it can be to identify fraudulent artistry—essentially a work of art whose merit is unearned on a formal level, but is still earned through some intentionally deceptive means (like a conceptual artist whose explanations of his or her art are so purposefully dense and opaque that even professional critics would be fooled into thinking that the artist was brilliant) or unintentionally (an artist whose work is created haphazardly and doesn’t reflect technical achievement or conceptual brilliance, but somehow happens to look like it does). For instance, a recent n+1 article explains how the American philosopher Stanley Cavell abandoned a possible career in music after struggling with how to differentiate true art and fraudulent art. (Academia in general is also subject to risk, though—just look up the Sokal Affair). For a mainstream instance of alleged arts trolling, check out “Exit Through the Gift Shop,” a documentary chronicling a French immigrant’s rise to fame as a street artist through clever marketing and publicity—even though the art itself is questionable.
As a student of jazz, I’m intimately familiar with trolling in an art form that has its fair share of trolls. Trolling in jazz is not uncommon: for as long as musicians have been holding open jam sessions, inept musicians have been showing up to the chagrin of other players. In response, the rhythm section, consisting of bass, drums, piano, and guitar in some configuration, might troll these inadequately prepared musicians off the stage by changing the key in which the song is being played. This renders the musical choices of the soloist completely irrelevant and often causes his or her playing to sound extraordinarily dissonant and therefore just plain bad.Another story I’ve heard involving jazz trolling began with a series of phone calls. A musician thought he’d play a practical joke by calling every bass player he knew and setting them up for what they thought was a real gig. These poor bassists agreed to meet at the place and time designated by their false employer, and at that particular day and time, bystanders were bewildered by the convergence of 30 men lugging double basses into the center of Time Square.The only thing that really matters for us non-trolls, though, is how to respond to a troll. Several weeks ago, a young musician in New York criticized Wayne Shorter, a legendary saxophonist who played with Miles Davis in the ’60s and became a widely respected composer in his own right. Ordinarily, this wouldn’t provoke too much controversy; everybody’s entitled to his or her opinion, right? Unfortunately, the phrasing of the comment, which used expletive language to insinuate that Shorter is a musical charlatan who is undeservedly lauded for his contributions to jazz, and the fact that it was shared publicly on Facebook led to a firestorm of replies and social media mini-debates; It even led some musicians to interpret the episode as evidence of the jazz community’s doomed future: a splintering and dissolution of this marginalized artistic community.As I’ve learned over the years, and as I hope many of those involved with this particular incident have learned, the best way to deal with trolling is to ignore it. Trolling stokes its own fire, and even cases that initially begin as unintentional provocation can turn into trolling—when parties become aggrieved and respond, causing the original provoker to feel defensive and shift from unintentional provocation to great provocation in self-defense. Certain incidents may require the intervention of outside parties, but I’d hesitate to call these incidents trolling. At a certain point, it’s just harassment.Harassment is bad, and trolling can be bad, but it needn’t be. At this point, sometimes I even enjoy getting trolled just a little bit, but as with drinking and as with art-making, we have to be responsible about it. Troll responsibly.—Columnist Kevin Sun can be reached at ksun@college.harvard.edu.

For a first-time visitor to Harvard, it is a bit of a shock to see to a concrete, spaceship-like building wedged between the traditional Barker Center and Fogg Museum. The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, now celebrating its 50th anniversary, might be a disappointment—at least a surprise—for those who think that “Harvard” and “red brick” are synonymous. As Harvard’s stronghold for artistic experimentation and innovation since 1963, the Carpenter Center still carries out its mission of helping to reconcile Harvard and artistic modernity—most recently, through its new exhibition “Brute,” which is on display in the Carpenter Center through April 7.Harvard is fortunate to have the Carpenter Center, modernist architect Le Corbusier’s only building in North America, on its campus. To celebrate the building’s half-century-long presence at Harvard, visual and environmental studies faculty members Katarina Burin and Amie Siegel have devised “Brute.” They have called upon a select group of internationally acclaimed artists, namely Nairy Baghramian, Anna Barriball, Barbara Bloom, and Alexandra Leykauf, to join them in responding to the architecture of Carpenter Center and Le Corbusier’s artistic legacy.What brings together all the artists featured in “Brute” is, in Burin’s words, an interest in the reflection of space in architecture. “Brute” aims to reactivate the whole building, not simply the parts of it normally used for exhibition, as a site of display by means of a mélange of the factual and fictional.To this end, one of the most intriguing components of “Brute” is its fabricated double, an imaginary exhibit only present in model form in the Main Gallery. The models show loans that were never actually made from the Harvard Art Museums collections, ranging from Josef Albers’s “square” paintings to a Jean Prouvé “chaise-longue,” on display on all five floors of the Carpenter Center. A perceptive visitor might note that only these “borrowed” works, and none physically present in the exhibit, are featured with photographs in the exhibition brochure; others might enthusiastically venture out to climb three flights of stairs in expectation of seeing a Trockel porcelain sculpture strangely exhibited next to a fragment of concrete from Chur, Switzerland, dated 200 B.C.E.-300 C.E., only to realize that the models are, in fact, fictional.In her contributions to the exhibition Katarina Burin emphasizes the presence of the modernist architectural and design heritage of Cambridge. Her displays and installations of documents and artifacts concentrate on the lives of architect-designers Fran Hosken, Eleanor Raymond, and Petra Andrejova-Molnár—the first two of whom received their design education in the Boston area, and the last of whom is entirely fabricated.
Among more direct responses to the architecture of the Carpenter Center are the works of Alexandra Leykauf and those of Anna Barriball. Professing an interest in the building’s mixture of serial production and organic forms, Leykauf considers space to be more than a medium. She has been inspired by the “ondulatoires” (undulating glass surfaces) of the second-floor studios to create “Untitled (open book),” an enlarged black and white photograph of an open book mounted on a convex wood screen. Seen from afar, “Untitled (open book)” deceives the eye and makes it seem as if the gigantic book is physically present, suggesting a depth and an irregular rhythm that echoes Le Corbusier’s “ondulatoires.”Anna Barriball’s video pieces negotiate space through the juxtaposition of representations of surfaces in photographic form. In “Screen (night photographs),” she loops the negatives of the photographs she has taken of every single window of the Carpenter Center from outside at night. Taken with a digital auto-focus flash camera, these photographs are almost aleatory shots of shining metal details or exit signs of the building. Along with her “Untitled,” a set of leaves cut out of curtain fabric scattered on the floor in the Main Gallery for the opening reception and subsequently removed, “Screen (night photographs)” simulates one’s consciousness while walking: Barriball calls the infinitesimal blackout between two photographs a “blink” between two locations.Whether or not she specifically addresses the Carpenter Center itself, each artist builds upon her reaction to the revolutionary aesthetic ideals of its architect. Siegel, whose film “Provenance” focuses on the circulation of Brutalist furniture from auction houses to a luxurious yacht, Parisian apartments, and a Punjabi library, succinctly replies with a smile on her face when asked about what the exhibition is really about. “‘Brute’ is the performance of a place,” she says.—Staff writer Gökcan Demirkazik can be reached at demirkazik@college.harvard.edu.

When last year’s graduating seniors were asked to take a survey detailing satisfaction with their concentration, many large departments, like economics and government, received mediocre <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/14/concentration-satisfaction-results/"">marks. While it may be tempting to explain away the survey’s lopsided results with such phenomena as, say, students without a particular passion for Pigovian welfare economics selecting the concentration for its lucrative exit opportunities, the fact remains that many Harvard students are not satisfied with their course of study. Harvard’s large concentrations should take the survey’s results seriously and look to smaller concentrations as a model.In order to best learn from this survey, the College should note that two main factors loosely correlate with a concentration’s popularity: the concentration’s size and the category in which it falls within the arts and sciences. The division with the most satisfied concentrators was the humanities, but even within that category, larger concentrations did relatively poorly. Two of the college’s largest concentrations, economics and government, received notably negative reviews from their concentrators. The exception to these trends was the small concentration of music, which received the lowest satisfaction rating of all concentrations.Perhaps even more disconcerting than the survey itself, however, are the reactions from some faculty members within poorly performing departments. In several cases, these faculty members, rather than take responsibility for their department’s performance, blamed external factors. The Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Department of Economics, Jeffrey A. Miron, believes that his department’s low satisfaction ratings are an unavoidable by-product of the fact that some concentrations are likely to attract students for reasons of utility: “I think some majors tend to get students because the students love those disciplines, and other majors get students because it’s a useful thing to do,” he said.Perhaps there is some truth to these explanations, but as the government department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch rightly said, “that doesn’t mean a big department can’t do better.” Harvard’s large concentrations should not simply shrug off this survey’s results as unfortunate but unavoidable; they should work to create better experiences for their students. Smaller concentrations, many of which did very well on the survey, often feature strong faculty-student interaction and vibrant advising systems. The life sciences have seen an increase in popularity after splitting into a number of smaller concentrations and implementing a more personalized advising system. All concentrations should note the positive effects that such endeavors have yielded and enact similar programs.Before taking any serious action, of course, the College and its departments should carry out more detailed and accurate surveys of student experience that control for factors like size and reason for concentrating. Even so, poorly performing departments should see the recent concentration satisfaction survey as a wake-up call, and they should contemplate serious changes instead of shunting responsibility onto external factors.
Harvard students should not have to sacrifice satisfaction with their studies if they wish to study a large concentration like economics or government. To the contrary, Harvard’s goal should be to offer a positive concentration experience for all of its students. Taking the recent concentration satisfaction survey seriously and enacting systemic changes per its results would be a key step toward realizing this goal.

Concealed in a Harvard repository, accessible only by special request, are some remarkable materials whose potential to influence collective memory is considerable, and whose public disclosure could be significant. The Tiananmen archives of the Harvard-Yenching Library contain thousands of photographs, manuscripts, and newspaper articles detailing the violent military crackdown of June 4, 1989, on student demonstrators in Beijing. The <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/5/26/library-books-google-dpla/"">recent debate on library digitization, in the context of the Collections Digitization Program of the Harvard College Library, has not yet touched upon the Tianamen archives, whose role nonetheless appears significant in such a discussion. Although the sensitive nature of the material poses concerns about the safety of authors and interviewees alike, enough time has passed so that the bulk of these materials may be made digitally available to the public without harm, potentially offering novel historical evidence regarding a highly contentious moment in the recent past of China.Harvard has had a fundamental role in keeping alive the memory of the Tiananmen massacre of June Fourth, a role perhaps best highlighted by the remarks of Lawrence Sullivan, research associate at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at the time of the crackdown. Sullivan <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1990/7/31/the-newest-harvard-hero-pa-few/"">declared to The Crimson in 1990, “Harvard has become the center of the Chinese dissident community.” The intention to establish a collection of material dealing with the pro-democracy movement of 1989 and its military suppression was first announced by Harvard-Yenching librarian Eugene W. Wu in October 1989. Wu, whose efforts were pivotal to the creation of the archives, <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1997/12.11/AChapterEnds.html"">talked of the Tiananmen collection to the Harvard Gazette at the time of his retirement in 1997. The librarian said he was “particularly pleased” with the acquisitions. The library became a recognized center for preserving the memory of June Fourth, and—as relayed by current librarian Xiao-he Ma—outsiders have been sending material for inclusion in the archives up to the present day. Strikingly, the archives include a pair of bloodstained trousers and a jacket, as well as several banners handwritten by the student demonstrators.“In view of the sensitive nature of some of the targeted materials, strict guidelines will be established regarding access,” Wu wrote in his 1989 announcement, “so as to provide maximum protection for the individuals whose identity might be revealed through these materials.” The potential dangers of a public disclosure of the materials are also highlighted by a notice appended at the front of the senior thesis of Tamar P. Shay ’93, which is included in the archives, and deals with the happenings of June Fourth. “The names of interviewees in this thesis have been disguised by pseudonyms,” Shay wrote. “However, because their identity can be surmised from other information, the safety of the interviewees could be compromised if the thesis comes to the knowledge of the Chinese government.”Many years have passed, however, and June 2014 will mark the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. Time has now eroded those dangers that prompted Wu and Shay to keep their work strictly confidential, and an initiative aimed at digitizing some of the Tiananmen archives’ materials could be plausible. While the decision to publicly distribute any single piece of archival evidence will ultimately have to rest with those whom the material concerns, it is conceivable that a critical mass of individuals willing to divulge information about themselves may be gathered. The possibility of a future digitization of the archives is particularly significant in light of the continuing censorship of the 1989 events on Chinese soil. The <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/world/asia/04museum.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">absence of a museum or memorial to the happenings of Tiananmen within China only adds to the momentousness of the archives.The importance of the quest for truthful historical memory that countless reporters, scholars, and students carry out daily stands pivotal in the face of persistent censorship. Although potentially long and costly, an initiative to digitize and disclose the Tiananmen Archives could offer fertile ground for more genuine historical investigation, in defiance of the authoritarian winds that many a time have blown to distort collective memory.

UPDATED: February 21, 2013, at 1:02 a.m.EdX, the nonprofit online learning venture started by Harvard and MIT last May, announced Wednesday that it is doubling in size and expanding internationally with the addition of six new schools to its consortium.EdX’s institutional members now include Australian National University, Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, McGill University and the University of Toronto in Canada, and Rice University in Texas.While edX users have come from all over the world since the platform’s launch last spring, the new partnerships in North America, Europe, and Australia will mark the first time online courses are developed offshore.“Each of these schools was carefully selected for the distinct expertise they bring to our growing family of edX institutions,” said Anant Agarwal, president of edX, in a press release. “We remain committed to growing edX to meet the needs of the world while maintaining a superior learning experience for all.”
Beginning in late 2013, ANUx, DelftX, EPFLx, McGillX, RiceX, and TorontoX will offer courses in topics ranging from science and the humanities to public policy.Classes announced so far include ANUx’s “Engaging India” and “Astrophysics,” the latter taught by Nobel Laureate Brian P. Schmidt. Additionally, “Introduction to Aerospace Engineering,” “Solar Energy,” and “Water Treatment Engineering,” will be offered later this year, all through DelftX. Finally, students of TorontoX will be able to take “Terrestrial Energy System,” “Behavioral Economics,” “The Logic of Business: Building Blocks for Organizational Design,” and “Bioinformatic Methods.”These universities join <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/2/mit-edx-virtual-online/"">founders Harvard and MIT, as well as the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/7/24/edx-ed-x-harvard-mit-berkeley-cal/"">University of California, Berkeley, the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/16/University-of-Texas-edX/"">University of Texas System, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/4/wellesley-joins-edx-liberal/"">Wellesley College, and <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/10/georgetown-joins-edx-online/"">Georgetown University in the X University Consortium. —Staff writer Amna H.

The Harvard College Democrats, which has not endorsed a candidate in a primary since at least the last five years, broke the tradition Tuesday night, voting 36-1 to support U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of Medford in his race against U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston. The two men are seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat vacated earlier this month by Secretary of State John F. Kerry.Also at the meeting, the Dems voted, 28-8, to support Divest Harvard, an initiative that calls on the University to withdraw endowment investments from fossil fuel corporations.Markey seemed to have the endorsement even before the speeches began. Many in the crowd sported “MARKEY FOR SENATE” stickers as they listened to the campaigns’ positions. As the votes were being tallied, members organized support efforts for Markey.“Maybe they’ll just count the Lynch votes, then subtract them from the total to get the Markey count,” said Dems member Alice F. Hyde ’16 before the meeting began. “That might make things quicker.”When it came time for the speakers to take the floor, State Rep. Carl Sciortino, speaking for Markey, struck a chord with the crowd. He repeatedly referred to Markey’s progressive stances on climate change, abortion, and LGBTQ rights.
Sciortino praised the Harvard Dems for their successful support of Senator Elizabeth Warren in her campaign last November.“If you look back at the last couple of election cycles, and what this group at Harvard did, wow,” Sciortino said.Following Sciortino, Braintree Mayor Joseph C. Sullivan, speaking for the Lynch campaign, began by addressing Lynch’s opponent.“We think [Markey’s] been a fine congressman, and we’d like to keep him there,” Sullivan told the crowd.Though he earned appreciative laughs and attention from the crowd, Sullivan was unable to downplay Lynch’s historically conservative record on social issues. In particular, his portrayal of Lynch as holding a pro-choice position on abortion was questioned more than once during the brief question and answer period following Sullivan’s remarks.After the votes were counted, Harvard Dems president Simon M. Thompson ’14 said he thought Markey’s progressive leanings—especially concerning hot-button issues like climate change, LGBTQ rights, and abortion—drove the endorsement.“I think that [Markey] and his positions speak well to the progressive views of college students today,” Thompson said.—Staff writer Matthew Q.

Of the 2195 fans who packed Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night to watch Harvard top Princeton, one has a particularly large stake in the future of the Crimson men’s basketball program.
<a name=""jump"">
Harvard commit Zena Edosomwan was in the stands for Saturday’s contest to cheer on the Crimson.
“I’m just excited to watch these guys play, but at the same time, it’s just, wow,” Edosomwan said. “I’m so excited for the next level. Look at the fans out here today. The crowd was so electric. Just honestly seeing how far the program has come, and how they’re playing, I’m very excited.”
Edosomwan, who turned down offers from Cal, UCLA, Texas, USC, Washington, and Wake Forest when he picked the Crimson last spring, is currently attending Northfield Mount Hermon in western Massachusetts.
Despite the fact that he is currently in the midst of his own season, Edosomwan says he keeps close tabs on the Crimson.
“I’m always keeping track,” he said,
Edosomwan and his teammates at NMH took on Harvard’s club team on Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion.
The 6’8” forward saw limited minutes in a 84-41 NMH victory. Playing in front of the Harvard coaching staff—including head coach Tommy Amaker—and a smattering of current Crimson players, Edosomwan posted 10 points and 12 boards, according to MaxPreps.com.
Edosomwan did all of his damage in the paint, finishing a variety of put-back and reverse layups.

Sophomore center Kenyatta Smith had the performance of his career for the Harvard men’s basketball team this weekend.By leading the Crimson to two victories over Penn and Princeton at Lavietes Pavilion, Smith helped widen Harvard’s advantage in the Ivy League standings and the race for an automatic NCAA tournament bid that comes along with an Ancient Eight title. With the win against the second-place Tigers, Harvard now has a 1.5 game lead in conference play, which becomes increasingly important as the madness of March approaches.Until last weekend, Smith had not lived up to his high school expectations. The three-star prospect was the Crimson’s highest rated recruit in his class and according to Scout.com was the nation’s No. 13 ranked center coming out of Flintridge Prep School in La Canada, Calif. But during his freshman season, he averaged just 2.1 minutes per game and only saw action in eight games.So far this season, he has enjoyed more playing time, averaging 12.4 minutes per game in 20 games. Even with the increase in playing time, Smith has only started seven times, with Harvard coach Tommy Amaker using him as a post presence off the bench in the past 15 games.But Friday was different, as the sophomore broke out in historic fashion with one of the best games Harvard has seen all season. Against Penn, Smith shattered the Crimson’s all-time blocks record of seven—which had stood since 1977—when he turned away 10 shots in 31 minutes of play. As well as dominating on the defensive end, he put up a career-high 20 points, going eight for nine from the field in an efficient offensive performance.
Adding to his career night, Smith had nine rebounds—just one board shy of a triple-double, an especially elusive statistical achievement for a center. The sophomore led both teams in rebounds and blocks on Friday night and was second only to sophomore forward Wesley Saunders in points.Friday night, Smith was tapped to start for the first time since the Crimson’s loss at the hands of Vermont on Nov. 27.“I was a little nervous, [having] not started since the beginning of the season,” said Smith after the contest against Penn. “But I just...tried to calm myself down and just focus on playing my game.”Smith’s focus paid off, as he topped his previous career highs in points, blocks, and rebounds. Throughout the season, Harvard has struggled to find a strong presence inside the paint, which Amaker highlighted as one the factors contributing to Smith’s starts this weekend.“We have to have a post presence...to be able to put the ball inside at some point, and [Smith is] our best option when it comes to that,” said Amaker following Friday night’s game. “I was incredibly impressed with how he handled it tonight.”After his performance the night before, Smith found himself in the starting lineup again against the Tigers on Saturday.In the Crimson’s biggest conference matchup so far this season, the center helped Harvard to a 12-point victory over its Ivy League rival and led the game with seven rebounds and six blocks. Finishing alongside sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi with a team-high 14 points, Smith took a total of nine shots—five from the field and four from the line—and sunk them all. Despite playing only 20 minutes, Smith was responsible for each of the Crimson’s six blocked shots.The victory over the Tigers gave Harvard a valuable edge in the conference standings, and his performance over the weekend earned Smith his first career nod as Ivy League Player of the Week. On the weekend, the sophomore amassed 34 points, 17 blocks, and 16 rebounds. He went 13 for 14 from the field and eight of nine from the line in 51 minutes of play—more than he had played in his last six games combined.Smith is now second in the Ivy League in blocks per game, despite having played less than half as many minutes as Brown’s league-leading freshman forward Cedric Kuakumensah.With six Ivy League games left to play for the Crimson—including a rematch against Princeton on the Tigers’ home court—Harvard will likely look to Smith for a continued inside presence as it works towards a title and a tournament bid.“There’s a lot of basketball still to be played,” said Amaker over the weekend. “Kenyatta was [given] an opportunity and embraced it.”This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 20, 2013An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the location of Sophomore center Kenyatta Smith's secondary school, Flintridge Prep School. In fact, the school is located in La Canada, Calif., not Brea, Calif.

“This is Harvard Hockey, A Tradition of Excellence.”  The tag-line on Harvard men’s hockey’s media guide doesn’t leave much room for error. 21 Ivy League titles, 12 Frozen Four Appearances, the 1989 NCAA Championship; the Crimson’s history dating back to 1897 backs up the guide’s bold claim. More than any other Harvard sport, save for crew, the men’s ice hockey program here in Cambridge boasts accolades not only impressive for a highly-academic school in the Ivy League, but also relevant on a national level.With nine NHL Draft picks, a returning First-Team All-American in captain Danny Biega and a No. 17 preseason ranking, the Crimson appeared poised to reignite that tradition of excellence this season. Instead, with four regular season games left on the schedule, Harvard currently sits in last place in the ECAC at 4-12-2 (7-15-3 overall). For the seventh straight year, the Crimson entered February with a losing record. My question to Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 and everyone associated with the program is: What gives?In years past, Donato has responded with the reasonable answer that the nature of Harvard’s schedule—a late start to the season compounded by a lengthy winter break—has prevented sustained momentum. This claim has been given some legitimacy by Donato’s teams’ composite record in the month of February. Since Donato took over the reins of the program from Mark Mazzoleni in 2004, the Crimson has gone 40-26-8 (.595) in 74 February games and just 83-88-27 (.487) in all other games. Recently, the difference has been even more pronounced. In the last five years, Harvard is 24-26-7 (.482) in games played after Feb. 1, and 26-57-17 (.345) in games played before that date.The Crimson is currently on a four-game unbeaten streak, the longest unbeaten stretch in what has been another long, disappointing season. With a win over No. 15 Boston University and a tie against No. 19 Dartmouth, it would seem that Donato’s self-fulfilling prophecy of late-season resurgence is making another appearance. After dealing with inconsistencies inherent to the team’s schedule, the Crimson is finally realizing its potential. It’s a classic story of redemption.The only problem is, these scheduling problems are not unique to Harvard. Both No. 13 Yale and the Big Green are in the Top 20 despite dealing with almost identical schedules. Ivy league teams don’t start until late October—as opposed to early October for other ECAC teams—and generally have around a two-week winter break at the end of December. If these other teams are able to build and maintain momentum in the early season and sustain that momentum through the end of the year, then what makes Donato’s Harvard teams exceptional?
This season, the Crimson has been hit with a number of personnel issues, notably the departure of defensive mainstays Patrick McNally and Max Everson. This has contributed to a slew of defensive issues that have led to Harvard giving up 79 goals against, third worst in the ECAC. But despite NHL-caliber offensive firepower in freshmen Jimmy Vesey (Nashville Predators, third round) and Brian Hart (Tampa Bay Lightning, second round), sophomores Colin Blackwell (San Jose Sharks, seventh round) and Petr Placek (Philadelphia Flyers, sixth round) and senior Alex Fallstrom (Boston Bruins, fourth round), the Crimson is currently last in the conference with just 56 goals scored in 25 games.Making things worse, after leading the nation in power-play conversion percentage last season, Harvard is 58th out of 59 NCAA Division I hockey programs, scoring on just 11 percent of its power-play opportunities. Clearly something more is amiss.In the past, calls for Donato’s job have been silenced by late-season success, and with the team’s recent form and the ECAC tournament looming in just a few weeks’ time, that may very well happen again. But Harvard should critically assess what it considers excellence on the hockey rink. Donato carries prestige, having played on that 1989 national championship team and following it up with a long career in the NHL. He has displayed an incredible ability to recruit top-shelf talent, with recent Donato recruits Alex Killorn ’12 and Louis Leblanc, formerly ’13, contributing to the Lightning and Montreal Canadiens, respectively, and the likes of Hart, Vesey and Biega sure to follow.These factors all contribute to building up the aura around one of Harvard’s premier athletic programs, but unless Donato can find a way to make the successes of the name on the front of the jersey match the successes of the names on the back, consistently over an entire season, Harvard hockey will continue to represent a tradition far-removed from excellence: that of disappointment and unmet expectations.—Staff writer Alexander Koenig can be reached at <a href=""mailto:akoenig@college.harvard.edu"">akoenig@college.harvard.edu.

I’ve never been to Ithaca. I hear it’s gorges.But on Saturday night, I had to double-check my GPS when I walked into the middle of the third period of the Harvard-Cornell men's hockey game. I was greeted by a sea of Waldos. Big Red-and-white-striped fans must have occupied a solid three-fourths of the seats at the Bright Hockey Center.Why was the Harvard presence so weak? The most obvious answer is that the Crimson men’s hockey team (and Cornell’s squad, for that matter) has reduced itself to irrelevancy this season. But that’s not the reason I—and I suspect many other Harvard students—avoided the first 50 minutes of a classic hockey rivalry.I had been busy watching a meaningful game—a game that carried real postseason implications, a game that would shape a Crimson team’s fate for the remainder of the season. I’m writing, of course, about the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 69-57 triumph over Princeton.Ivy League basketball and ECAC hockey are two totally different animals. In Ancient Eight hoops, every game counts. The regular season is essentially a big round-robin tournament that decides which team goes to the Big Dance in March.
Comparatively, the ECAC regular season means jack squat. Sure, regular season success satiates a hungry fan base and provides helpful postseason positioning. But beyond that, a first-place finish or a 12th-place finish does not guarantee a team’s final fate. Just ask 11th-seeded Brown, which reached the ECAC semifinals in 2010, or sixth-seeded Harvard, which won it all in 2004. All 12 teams have a shot in the ECAC Tournament.Few sports leagues offer a bottom-feeder the opportunity to renovate a season in just six games. In recent years, the Harvard men’s hockey team has embraced this opportunity. In 2013, the Crimson will have to welcome the postseason with open arms like never before.The bottom line: The season is not lost. It can be saved.The Crimson’s recent play is indicative of a team preparing for another last-minute push. After an eight-game losing streak, Harvard has been unbeaten in its last four, winning two and tying two. The Crimson has not necessarily found a way to win, but it has found a way not to lose.In the past couple of weeks, it seems that Harvard’s senior players have realized that they have one final chance to rewrite their legacy.“We [seniors] want to make an impression or at least go out on top as much as we can,” senior forward Marshall Everson told me the day before the Crimson’s Beanpot consolation game versus Boston University.In that game, seniors scored six of Harvard’s seven goals in a 7-4 win. Four days later, seniors contributed the Crimson’s first three goals in a 4-1 victory over Colgate.Underperformances from Harvard’s veterans have characterized much of the Crimson’s struggles this year. But Everson, Luke Greiner, Alex Fallstrom, and Danny Biega appear to be righting the ship.Injuries and sudden departures have also plagued Harvard this season, but things are starting to look up in the personnel department. Most notably, rookie Kyle Criscuolo has started to hit his playmaking stride after returning from the disabled list at the beginning of the month.The freshman center has recorded five assists in the last five games. With Criscuolo out of the lineup, the Crimson posted a 1-9-0 record. With Criscuolo in, Harvard has gone 6-6-3.

There’s no place like home.After going 3-3-1 since its last home game on Jan. 19, the Harvard women’s hockey team found its groove again at the Bright Hockey Center on Tuesday night. Despite playing with an altered lineup, the squad registered its 18th straight home victory dating back to last year with a 5-2 win over Brown.Harvard outshot its visitors, 52-16, and drew eight penalties while only committing five infractions.“Their goaltender played real well but we had a lot of good looks at the net,” Harvard coach Katy Stone said. “I liked our effort—backchecking, forechecking—it was a pretty comprehensive game. We got a lot of new faces in the lineup and that was exciting for us.”Despite a shuffling of the lineup before the game, the Crimson’s second line continued its hot streak early, scoring the first goal of the game eight minutes into the first period. Down on the red line, freshman Dylanne Crugnale threaded a pass to sophomore Hillary Crowe in the slot, who stood ready to one-time the puck by Brown goalie Katie Jamieson on the farside for a 1-0 lead. Crowe’s goal extended her point streak to a career-high five games.
Crugnale got the assist after being added to the second line when senior Kaitlin Spurling was moved to the top group to replace junior Kalley Armstrong, who missed the game with an injury, though according to Katy Stone, Armstrong’s absence was mainly precautionary.“Our whole year has been about stepping up, filling spots, and I’m completely confident in any of our forwards to step up when Army gets hurt or I get hurt,” Fry said. “I think [Spurling] did a great job and I think Dylanne did a great job when she came up front.”The Bears were able to answer Harvard’s opening tally a minute later with a redirection from the slot to tie the game on the team’s second shot.But after that, Brown would have no response for the remainder of the Crimson’s onslaught.Harvard broke the tie before the first period was over when junior Lyndsey Fry beat Jamieson on a breakaway. Co-captain Jillian Dempsey earned an assist on the play by intercepting a puck at center ice and flicking it to a streaking Fry.With the point, Dempsey entered the top ten in points in Harvard history.“[It is] just unreal to be even mentioned with some of those players,” Dempsey said. “I couldn’t have done it without my teammates throughout the years.”Though the Crimson entered the first intermission with a 2-1 advantage, the damage could have been worse as Jamieson made 20 saves in the first period. The goalie continued to stand on her head in the second, making 13 stops on 14 shots, including saves on a number of point-blank opportunities. She finished with 47 saves.“After the first period it was like, ‘Here we have all these shots and we aren’t producing much,’” Fry said. “She’s a big goalie, she’s a strong goalie, and she does a really good job of getting square with the puck so as long as we were shooting at her without anybody in front she was going to make those saves, as she should.”Several of Jamieson’s second-period stops came while her team was attempting to kill the four penalties it committed in the second period alone. Harvard made the Bears’ job easier by negating multiple man advantages with infractions of its own.

Harvard's men's basketball team is first in the Ivy League, which means we might want to start taking school spirit seriously. But this can be hard. And since I am incredibly qualified to advise other Harvard students how to show some spirit (I did watch all three ""Bring It On"" movies), here are some tips.<!--more-->1. Face PaintNothing says ""I love sports"" quite like face paint. You can put it on your cheeks, your chest, or your car to cover up that dent your parents don't know about. If you don't want shell out the cash for crimson face paint, you can get the same red-faced effect by running around for a couple minutes or blushing constantly.2. Go to a GameIt may sound extreme, but the good news is that you don't have to go for long. Just long enough to snap a selfie of you in your face paint and get interviewed for the next Crimson article. For which you should say ""Go Crimson!!!!"" Make sure to convey all the exclamation marks. Fans like punctuation.
3. Follow a PlayerFind an athlete (preferably a good looking and single one) and become their number one fan. Cheer for them at games, study their statistics and memorize their class schedules. Trust me, this is the closest to socially acceptable stalking that you will ever get.4. Make a BetPut your money where your mouth is; make a bet and suck on a quarter (it's a good source of copper). It's easy. Just find your bookie and put twenty dollars down on the Harvard basketball team, or, if you are playing Roulette, all your chips on Crimson.

What  happens when two very different one-trick ponies co-star together in  one movie? Pretty much what you’d expect, actually. “Identity Thief,”  which opened Friday, is a vehicle for the boisterous Melissa McCarthy to  torture the always dour Jason Bateman. And she does, for nearly two  hours, with plenty of bodily humor to keep the movie entertaining in  short, cringe-inducing bursts. However, the chemistry between the two  never quite materializes, and these frequent pit stops aren’t enough to  justify the movie’s 112-minute runtime. Bateman plays his usual hard-luck character: a well-mannered  businessman stuck in a mid-level job and surrounded by idiots. His  character, Sandy Patterson, finally gets a chance at the VP job of a  shiny new investment firm, but he is disgraced when his identity is  swiped by a spa-loving convict—of what Patterson terms “Hobbit  height”—living in Florida (McCarthy). In order to preserve his job,  Patterson must travel from Denver to Florida to nab the thief and bring  her back. The chase ignores several easier fixes to the problem: why  doesn’t Patterson cancel the credit cards? Surely the credit companies  can get involved? But of course, a practical solution wouldn’t lead us  to scenes like Patterson and his nemesis wrestling in a lavish Florida  condo, with Patterson eventually smashing her over the head with a  guitar.And  there’s plenty more where that came from. For better or for worse, the  funniest parts of the movie come from McCarthy’s physical humor, which  carried her through her breakout role in “Bridesmaids.” She drew  snickers from the audience just by appearing on screen in a bright pink  top, eyes bugging out, chubby arms full of cosmetics. She beats Bateman  over the head with a flaming stick, has sex with reckless abandon, and  gets catapulted into the air by a speeding car. Her complete commitment  to these often uncomfortable physical roles deserves some amount of  praise. However, it’s too bad that director Seth Gordon has to rely  so heavily on these visual gags to keep the movie humming. Bateman can  be as witty as anyone in the business, but he doesn’t get lines that  show off his expert deadpan delivery. The film sets and maintains a  fairly low bar for comedy; for example, one of the principal recurring  gags is that Sandy is considered a girl’s name. During the lulls in  physical action, the dialogue feels like filler rather than comedic  opportunity, making it hard not to empathize with Bateman’s exasperation  that we haven’t arrived in Denver yet.
 Further hurting the movie is its ridiculous drug  dealer/bounty hunter side plot, in which a collection of buffoons with  varying motives attempts to murder the two leads at every step. However,  their presence is hardly explained or mined for any laughs. This  classic trope can work if ridiculous enough—think Ken Jeong’s sneering  Mr. Chow in “The Hangover”—but here, T.I. and Genesis Rodriguez crash on  and offstage randomly, adding nothing to the action nor the comedy. With each passing town, it becomes clear that McCarthy’s  character—unnamed for most of the movie—has deep psychological problems  that can be traced to her being abandoned as a baby and going through  the throes of foster care. “Blame the system!” the movie seems to shout.  Unfortunately, the morals are too little, too late, and out of place.  Moreover, they seem to condone McCarthy’s drunk-driving,  throat-punching, binge-spending ways, a very questionable takeaway point  from a major motion picture. In the concluding scene, Gordon finds the balance between  sincerity and humor. A flash-forward shows Patterson and McCarthy’s  character meeting again three years later. The dialogue is warm, fluid,  and optimistic, and the two show a natural rapport. The movie could have  ended there, but McCarthy promptly punches a woman who calls her  “bitch” and gets tasered as M.I.A.’s “Bad Girls” jingles in the  background. Perhaps this is Gordon’s way of acknowledging that the  pairing doesn’t quite work—maybe it’s just better for McCarthy to take  the spotlight and do her thing. —Staff writer Andrew Chow can be reached at andrewchow@college.harvard.edu.

This year’s Oscar nominees are a controversial bunch, to say the least. “Zero Dark Thirty” prompted Congressional hearings about its depiction of torture; “Django Unchained” was certainly racially charged; and “Argo” fell victim to a much-discussed snub in the Best Director category.Then there’s “Les Misérables.” The controversy there can be boiled down to one word: really?An incredible amount of hay has been made as to whether “Les Misérables” deserves to be in competition for the lofty prize. First came glowing early reviews and predictions of Oscar gold that propelled the film forward, followed soon after by a major backlash. But the third and current phase has been somewhat unique, not only in character but in duration. Negative reviews of highly anticipated films inevitably evoke ire from fans, but rarely is the reaction so sustained—or so ad hominem towards dissenters. I have yet to see a justification of the film that actually argues for the movie’s merits; instead, the film’s defenders assert that those who dislike the movie are predisposed against it and are nitpicking problems just to be contradictory or, worse, to ruin the experience for those who did enjoy it.This defense has yet to rest. On Jan. 28, New York Times critic Stanley Fish published a piece entitled “Les Misérables’ and Irony,” in which he declares that those who “trash” the film do so out of fear that applauding its unironic assault on the senses means being labeled a “bourgeois cheerleader.” Fish argues that critics who dislike the material or find director Tom Hooper’s in-your-face directorial style don’t appreciate the raw, unaffected emotions Hooper strives to create. The movie, Fish says, aims to disarm viewers of their ability to detach from the characters and “leaves critics with nothing to do except join the rhythms of rapt silence, crying and applause, and it is understandable that they want nothing to do with it.”The flaw in this argument is that it is simply wrong. Rebuttals like Fish’s do nothing to debunk the criticisms of the film; claiming admiration of a movie solely for its director’s intentions ignores the multitude of problems that can arise in execution. It’s Hooper’s penchant for extreme close-ups and not his goal that has drawn so much ire. Few would argue that a bomb like “Movie 43” deserves praise just for trying to be funny, so why do proponents of “Les Misérables” claim the film’s intentions override its many blemishes?
Besides, talking about claustrophobia-inducing camera work and sappy material, as most of the film’s critics do, certainly isn’t nitpicking; it’s calling out factors perceived as major, in many ways damning, flaws. I have personally been very vocal about my negative feelings towards the film, most of which stem from the cinematography and performances. If I were to instead point out such mistakes as the presence of a modern-looking Santa Claus in the 1840s when his current depiction wasn’t codified until the 1930s, that would indeed warrant a severe finger-wagging. But I haven’t seen a single review that mentions this mistake, and indeed I only bring it up here to illustrate what could reasonably be described as an overly specific criticism.More problematically, fans of the film outright disparage the intentions of moviegoers and critics who don’t enjoy the film. I have watched movies for the sole purpose of mockery, films including such “gems” as “The Star Wars Holiday Special.” But aside from such legendarily bad movies, I watch films with the sincere intention of enjoying them, even when I plan on writing a review or analysis. To argue that critics walk into a theater hoping to feel nothing for two or more hours is to suggest that they have a decidedly masochistic approach to their job.A critic of any medium who only recommends works from which he felt fully detached does a disservice to his audience, and I have never seen a piece of criticism reflecting this predilection. The job by necessity requires a willingness to submit to emotional experiences for the sake of better being able to convey to readers a piece’s flaws or merits. And yet, proponents of “Les Misérables” ascribe detachment—even outright malice towards tear-jerking cinema—to those who scorn this particular adaptation, even when the same critics frequently praise other movies precisely for their emotional heft.Most pressing is that this head-in-the-sand approach of deriding a film’s detractors undermines the very foundation of the critical community, the reason for existence of which is to engender thoughtful discussion and analysis of a work. Negative responses deserve to be entertained, even if only so that they may be disproved; very few films deserve to be considered entirely unimpeachable. I’m more than happy to hear out your praise; all I ask in return is my right to disagree.—Columnist Jeremy Y. Venook can be reached at jvenook@college.harvard.edu.

Harvard Law School students hosted 21 high schoolers from the Boston Debate League Tuesday in a day-long seminar designed to help young debaters improve their policy debate skills. Students attended a criminal law class, toured the University, and heard from law school dean Martha L. Minow and a number of law school professors.Amy H. Bond, a first-year student at HLS who helped organize the event, said she and other law students were inspired to host the seminar after judging the Boston Debate League’s tournament in January. Impressed by the quality of the high school debaters, Bond and her classmates decided to contribute to the Boston Debate League’s mission—bringing debate to students from Boston’s public schools who might not otherwise experience it.“Historically, policy debate has been a prohibitively expensive activity,” Bond said, outlining common preparations like debate camp, personal coaching, and tournaments out of town. She added that it is nonetheless an important skill that develops analytical reasoning, research acumen, and persuasive rhetoric. Exposure to policy debate is especially valuable because it is directly applicable to the law profession.During the seminar, students­—a number of whom competed at the national debate tournament at Harvard last weekend—attended a mock debate between law school professors Michael J. Klarman and Julie C. Suk ’97 on the role of courts in the civil rights movement. HLS librarians demonstrated how to conduct policy research and students also had an opportunity to hear from law professors Daniel J. Meltzer ’72, Charles J. Ogletree, and Jon D. Hanson.The debaters also learned about student life and admissions at Harvard from an admissions officer and current undergraduates. Michelle E. Choi ’16, who volunteered at the event, said she and other undergraduates who have benefited from debate hope to share similar opportunities with younger students who do not have access to comparable resources. “As of now, a group of undergrads who did debate want to establish a long-term program to have consistent mentorship for these debaters,” she said.
La Alianza, the Black Law Students Association, and the Dean of Students Office co-sponsored the event. Bond said HLS students may consider making the seminar an annual event.

It’s not everyday that an opera company turns 75. In fact, there is only one such group in New England that can boast such a lengthy continuous run: the Lowell House Opera. This group, which mixes Harvard students with professional performers and a production team from the Cambridge and Boston communities, has been performing in the Lowell House dining hall since 1938.“Working with LHO is very difficult and exciting because it’s totally different from what goes on in the rest of the theater community at Harvard. You’re working in a company that has a history and a future, and you’re working with donors and alumni,” says student producer Nicholas T Rinehart ’14, a Crimson arts editor.There is a definite sense of professionalism at the Lowell House Opera, created by the integration of the larger arts community into the performing company, says LHO alumn Anh M. Le ’12. “It’s a place where students learn from professionals, and there’s really a professional aspect to it,” she says. “We bring in outside singers, outside instrumentalists; we really try to utilize the amazing talent that is in the larger Boston region.” The company has throughout its history synthesized the talents from both inside and outside the Harvard gates, but recently there has been a push to encourage even more student involvement. One aspect of this push was the creation of a new student production fellowship—Rinehart now holds this position.In this capacity, he has already started revamping the company in honor of its 75th anniversary by initiating the creation of a new website and logo. “I’ve taken it upon myself to totally rebrand the company,” he says. This year will also mark the start of the James Laurence Michel Memorial Lecture Series, named after the late Dr. James L. Michel ’76, a longtime supporter of the LHO. These lectures will feature members of the Boston community, like Harvard music professor Carolyn Abbate and various graduate students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.The 75th season has a certain air of innovation, but in a house full of traditions, many aspects remain the same. Perhaps the greatest point of consistency over the 75 years has been the unique and challenging performance venue. “A giant chandelier is a part of your stage no matter what, and it may make sense for the opening act of “La Traviata,” but there aren’t many of other operas where a giant chandelier remains on the stage for the entire production,” LHO stage director Roxanna K. Myhrum ’05 says. “It’s funny to think of generations of other people being like, ‘All right, how do I do “Turandot” with a giant chandelier? How do I stage “Madame Butterfly” and “Candide”?’…. That chandelier exists through time for everyone.”
While performing in a dining hall has its setbacks, it’s the opera’s connection to Lowell House that music director Lidiya V. Yankovskaya believes has allowed the opera to perform continuously for so long. “The people who have been in charge of Lowell House through these years…have been so supportive of the opera and have recognized what an important part the opera is not only of the Lowell and the Harvard community, but of the Boston community as a whole,” she says.And the Lowell House Opera has contributed to the community—not simply through its performances, but also by exposing its members to the world of theater. “When I came into Harvard freshman year, I just really liked listening to opera… I knew nothing about theater,” says Le,  who is now a student at the Yale School of Drama. “It was really because of Lowell House Opera that I now have this professional goal and have this kind of career dream, so it’s been a huge impact on my life.” She is studying theater management with the goal of becoming an opera producer and is only one of many alums who have pursued a career in the opera community.  Along with its other accomplishments, Lowell House Opera can celebrate inspiring its members, another tradition that the historic company plans to continue for many years to come.

What does a squirrel holding a grenade have in common with a beautiful, seashell-shaped agate teapot? Both are subjects of ceramic pieces crafted by Michelle Erickson, a renowned artist whose work combines historical ceramic techniques with modern themes.While most of her work is original, Erickson has over 20 years of experience working with 17th- and 18th-century reproduction pottery. Her reproductions and contemporary pieces have won critical acclaim across the globe. Erickson, who recently returned from a three-month artist residency at The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, will be teaching a Visiting Artist Workshop through the Office of Fine Arts at Harvard  on Feb 28.The Harvard Crimson: How would you describe your style of ceramic work?Michelle Erickson: I use a lot of…references from ceramic history—both lost ceramic arts that have been rediscovered and techniques I looked into, and also the context of that history, of the social or political or environmental context of that history [as a way] to describe 21st century issues. So, I would say my work is narrative. It uses history as a way of looking at our present human condition.THC: You are known for your work with both recreations of older pottery styles and contemporary pieces. How are the two creative processes different, and which do you find more rewarding?
ME: For me, the two processes are totally integrated, so I don’t make that distinction. A lot of the work that I do in recreating is trying to rediscover a technique that was used to originally make a piece...and then I tend to use a lot of those techniques sometimes in a very different way in my contemporary work than in the recreated object.… Both processes are so integrated into each other.THC: You’ve worked with a variety of different historical ceramic traditions during the course of your career. Do you have a favorite?ME: I think one of my favorite types of ceramic techniques to work in is slipware, which is almost the antithesis of the blue and white pottery tradition...it manipulates liquid clays in different ways. Slipware is sort of one end of the spectrum and blue and white porcelain is the other, and I really like both of those two extremes.THC: You do a lot of work with clays you find yourself instead of simply buying commercial clay. How does that play into your work?ME: I certainly do use commercial clays, but I can’t just use any clay for a lot of the things that I do. I really have to find the right clays. I like to get clays right from the ground and use them in different ways, and sometimes they are very unusable. They’re not necessarily predictable or dependable, and they might not do the kind of things you want them to. But I find that I like to have the material and the symbolism of clays from different areas.... I don’t really have an agenda with indigenous clays: I just like to explore them and see where they lead.THC: What do you hope to gain from the experience of teaching a workshop at Harvard?ME: I always learn when I’m trying to teach or illustrate things that have become kind of second nature to my own practice. When you have to get outside of yourself and bring that material to an audience who may or may not have any knowledge of it, it really forces you to look at and describe your work in ways that you may not do when you’re just working on your own.

Nick Cave, the brooding and self-absorbed heart of Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds, has long dedicated himself to pushing the limits of the musical macabre. Against all odds, the group has attained an even higher level of eccentricity with their newest album, ""Push The Sky Away."" Cave’s hallmarks include his low register, at-times-threatening lyrics, and tense instrumentals that form a dark frame for his voice. ""Push The Sky Away"" develops the band’s classic sound, adding an element of lunacy to the band’s traditionally grim yet controlled lyrics and balancing the usually deep tone of the music with more whimsical tropes. The most remarkable feature of the album, however, is the earnestness that persists in Cave’s unwaveringly brooding vocals, which maintains the album’s integrity even as Cave vacillates between his classically disturbing images and the more insubstantial themes that crop up on ""Push The Sky Away.""Since their inception in 1983, Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds have recorded 15 albums. Each of these works help to construct the gloomy and pensive oeuvre for which ""Push The Sky Away"" acts as the culmination. Before its recording, the group was scattered. Cave and a few others branched off to work on a side project, Grinderman, and the original bassist, Barry Adamson, left the group. After the disbandment of Grinderman and Adamson’s decision to rejoin, the group reconvened for their tour de force, ""Push the Sky Away.""The first track from the album reveals the group’s newfound fascination with the more cosmetic possibilities of production. The song—whose title, ""We No Who U R,"" might be more at home on a Ke$ha album—proves to be shockingly catchy while still setting the sinister tone for the rest of ""Push The Sky Away."" Instrumentally, the song derives its success from the combination of airy, feminine backup vocals and flute that balance Cave’s throaty growl. The piano-driven chord progression and clean percussion give the song an unexpected sweetness. The beginning lines of the song contribute to this dulcitude, with Cave softly intoning, ""We go down with the dew in the morning light."" Almost inevitably, the band deserts the positive vibe and relapses into its classic sound. The lyrics abandon lighthearted natural imagery for an unsettling tone with, ""And we know who you are / And we know where you live / And we know there’s no need to forgive,"" establishing the generally deranged mood of ""Push The Sky Away."" This song begins the album on a strong note, introducing an attractive, accessible pop sensibility while still remaining cohesive with the rest of the body of work.The other high point of the album is the beginning of ""Higgs Boson Blues,"" where Cave relinquishes any lyrical inhibitions that may have previously stifled him. Instrumentally, the song is not of particular interest—the instrumentation primarily comprises guitar and percussion, the guitar changing chords only every other measure and the drums not doing much more than keeping the time. The decision to err on the side of simplicity here, however, intentionally highlights Nick Cave’s voice and, more specifically, lyrics. The beginning of the song logically approaches the two titular topics: the Higgs Boson and the blues. Cave begins the song with a narrative setup, ""I’m driving my car down to Geneva,"" which is the location of the Large Hadron Collider where the Higgs Boson was investigated; he also makes reference to Robert Johnson, an influential blues singer. Within this concrete frame, Cave’s lyrics are free to reach a new state of fevered brilliance, and he sings, ""Well here comes Lucifer / With his canon law / And a hundred black babies runnin’ from his genocidal jaw."" The first half of ""Higgs Boson Blues"" is marked by lyrics that feel wildly surrealistic yet strike a chord of earnestness that makes the song feel genuine despite its mania.In the song’s second half, however, the major flaw of ""Push The Sky Away"" comes to the fore as the cohesiveness of the lyrics falter over awkward allusions to pop culture which clash with the mood of the band. Among a gallimaufry of inexplicable lines, Cave’s apparent obsession with everybody’s favorite Disney starlet becomes evident in the lines ""Hannah Montana does that African savanna"" and ""Miley Cyrus floats in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake."" It is in lyrical moments such as these that the songs seem to lose the balance between eccentricity and gravity. It is evident that Nick Cave believes in these lyrics, but his conviction only carries him so far.
The atmospheric, experimental ""Push The Sky Away"" marks the reinventive return of Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds. Even with the new turns that the group takes, though, it still feels like a sincerely crafted album. Of course, because of Cave’s singular mind, some of the elements that arise from his sincerity can be jarringly strange. An overwhelming majority of the album is captivating, and the candor with which it is presented makes ""Push The Sky Away"" a memorable album in the extensive discography of Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds.

Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States Sherry Rehman advocated improving international relations while facing tough criticism over domestic issues at the Institute of Politics Tuesday night.Meghan L. O’Sullivan, professor of the practice of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, set the tone for the night when welcoming the speaker.“She really embodies the bridge between these two countries,” Sullivan said. “As we well know, this is a difficult relationship, but also a consequential relationship.”Rehman opened by echoing hopes for a sustainable relationship between the United States and Pakistan, focusing her address on lessons learned from the past.Rehman referenced the war in Afghanistan with its political, social, and cultural implications. She highlighted its continued centrality in the countries’ current discourse, yet emphasized the danger in repeating the mistakes of the past.
“Even if we had somehow crafted and executed the best of policies, Pakistan was left with some of the world’s largest population of refugees,” Rehman said. “They are the forgotten statistic from that war. Ladies and gentleman, Pakistan cannot afford a repeat of the 1980s.”The ambassador also called for positive changes in disposition to ensure a sustainable relationship.“Coarse diplomacy through the media is not the way to diplomacy. We need to talk issues through,” Rehman said.The night transitioned to a forum where attendees, many from Pakistan or of Pakistani descent, requested the ambassador’s insight into some of the country’s most poignant issues.Rabeea Ahmed ’14 asked the ambassador of the current mass killings in Balochistan and the government’s response to such violations of human rights.Syed Shehroz Hussain received resounding applause after questioning the ambassador why his late father, a Shia leader in Pakistan, was not provided with the protection he requested.“My government has treated this act of senseless murder as quite unconscionable and frankly unacceptable as it presents a clear and present danger to us and how we seek to protect our citizens,” Rehman said. “If our citizens are unempowered or endangered it is the failure of our government.”As tensions subsided, the ambassador chose to end the night on a positive note.“Enough of looking back,” Rehman said. “We are looking forward rather than looking backwards. Let me assure you, history will not end in 2014. Pakistan hopes to be a valuable partner and friend beyond that milestone.”—Staff writer Fatima Mirza can be reached at fmirza@college.harvard.edu.

The memoir “True Notebooks” begins similarly to many education dramas: a man walks into a raucous classroom filled with at-risk youth. Anybody who has seen “Freedom Writers,” “Stand and Deliver,” or “Coach Carter” can predict how the rest of the story should go: the man will slowly win over the troubled teens and—despite seemingly insurmountable odds—the students will flourish and become fine, on-track young adults. The beauty in “True Notebooks: A Writer’s Year at Juvenile Hall” is in its ability to transcend this worn-out narrative.In the book, author Mark Salzman tracks his challenging first year as a writing teacher at Los Angeles’s Central Juvenile Hall. Salzman is deeply wary of his memoir becoming a feel-good, bootstrappin’ tale. In fact, at the beginning of the story, when Salzman is trying to talk himself out of teaching the class, he writes, “Reasons not to get involved…The Cliché Problem: white guy with everything going for him telling dark-skinned kids in prison that art matters.” By acknowledging this risk from the start, “True Notebooks” defies cliché and instead offers a candid narrative of juvenile hall and the boys who live there. It was this authenticity of the book that gave me critical perspective at two distinct times in my life.I first read “True Notebooks” in seventh grade. Like many great books, it transported me into a world different from my own. Through Salzman’s recollections I discovered the inner workings of L.A.’s Central Juvenile Hall; through inmates’ poems and essays I saw gang fights, drive-by shootings, and Russian roulette. Yet the book gave me a different perspective than other books and movies about inner city America. Other accounts of wayward youth led me to believe that a strong role model and a positive attitude was all it took to turn someone’s life around. “True Notebooks” shattered that illusion.Many of the boys featured in “True Notebooks” face bleak futures. Kevin Jackson—my favorite character and arguably Salzman’s favorite student—shows tremendous growth throughout the story. He becomes a leader in the classroom and helps recruit others to join the class. He shows true remorse for the gang-related shooting that ended in the death of a teenager—even though he belongs to a rival gang—and in Salzman he finds a role model. Yet, in the penultimate chapter, Jackson’s sentencing at the end of his time at Juvenile Hall results in 66 years to life in federal prison, and he is immediately transferred to a maximum-security facility near Sacramento. Kevin’s story was devastating, but it provided some much-needed perspective. “True Notebooks” stood in my seventh-grade mind as a worthy counter-narrative to standard white savior spiels, deserving in its unwillingness to be anything other than an account of harsh reality.My second reading of “True Notebooks” left me feeling not depressed, but inspired. When I revisited the book last year, its subject matter was no longer alien to me. I was working full-time at a middle school in Watts—a neighborhood in south Los Angeles historically known for intense gang violence. I was assigned to assist a class of eighth graders, all of whom had scored “far below basic” on the California Standards Test. The harsh realities I had learned about in “True Notebooks” were right in front of me: gang fights occurred nearly every week, gunshots interrupted class on more than one occasion, and my students continued to fail test after test. I had no illusions that I would be the hero in a beautiful underdog story.
In March, my favorite student was sentenced to six months for a gang-related crime. I knew he would be sent to L.A.’s Central Juvenile Hall, the very place I had come to know when I first found “True Notebooks.” I picked up the story again to try to gain perspective on where my student would be spending his 14th birthday and summer vacation.I left the book once more with a renewed outlook on the world. The last page of the memoir is a poem that Jackson sent to Salzman from his high security cell. In the poem, Jackson outlines the bleakness of his situation, yet maintains a hopeful attitude:“I still have a long journey to go / But I’ll be free again /  I’ll use this time to grow / In not just one way, but all / There’s a lot for me to learn / So I’m gonna start like a baby, with a crawl.”With my rereading of the poem, Kevin Jackson’s story—the very story that had depressed me in seventh grade—became a beacon of hope. No, Kevin’s life was not going to be filled with success or happiness. Yes, Kevin would probably spend the rest of his life in jail. And yet, the existence of a book that captured Kevin’s story was reassuring, even hopeful; I could truly believe this cautious optimism for the simple reason of Salzman’s commitment to the truth.

On Feb. 6, the Committee on Undergraduate Education discussed <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/cue-meeting-reading-period/"">a proposal to change the structure of reading and exam periods. Under the proposal, assignments such as final projects and papers would no longer be due during reading period, and instead on specified dates during exam period. As Harvard examines how this would change the last weeks of each semester, Flyby took a look around to see how some other schools handle it. <!--more-->
Princeton: Princeton also has a <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/ua/sections/8/"">reading period that lasts approximately 10 days, during which faculty can choose to hold class. The last day of their reading period is dubbed ""dean's date"" and is designated for the "" final submission of written work"", including papers and projects. And don't forget — unlike <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/6/6/university-leaders-approve-calendar-reform-interim/"">Harvard, they have their fall semester finals <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/pub/agf/calendar/"">after winter break.

Instead, the take-home finals are due during the regular exam period. Other final assignments, however, are due during reading period: ""It is expected that instructors will require all course assignments, including term papers, to be submitted at the latest by the last day of reading period,"" the reading period policy reads.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 21, 2013An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the date on which the Committee on Undergraduate Education dicussed a propose to restructure reading period.

“Pirate Flag”Kenny Chesney, “Life on a Rock” Country superstar Kenny Chesney released this summery single just in time for the winter storm Nemo. ""Pirate Flag"" celebrates a man who trades in his small-town life for a full-time party with rum, pirate flags, and ""island girls."" Chesney releases his signature drawl over an introductory bed of acoustic guitar and rhythmic clapping, which is soon overwhelmed by a more driving beat as Chesney slips deeper into pirate mode. The story is somewhat undermined by logical gaps—Chesney claims to have ridden the bus to his Caribbean getaway—and its forced rhyming makes it a difficult sing-along. Still, the song’s upbeat tempo and fun, if ridiculous, theme could make it a nice addition to any party playlist. 
 “Major Distribution”50 Cent Ft. Snoop Dogg and Young Jeezy, “Street King Immortal” ""Major Distribution"" is the first single off of 50 Cent’s long awaited album, ""Street King Immortal."" Throughout the song, 50 rumbles in his signature raspy-melodic voice, ""I’m trying to move one brick, two brick, three bricks, four."" Presumably intended to sound intimidating, the lines come off sounding like a nursery rhyme written to help children learn how to count. This singsong chorus is composed of three unremarkable verses. Despite its shortfalls, the song is worth a listen, as it features Snoop Lion as his former, rapping Snoop Dogg self. But don’t get excited for a Doggy-Dog return—the song was recorded before Snoop adopted his new reggae persona.“Mirrors”Justin Timberlake, “The 20/20 Experience” After half a decade without Justin Timberlake, two new singles in the space of a few weeks feels like rain in the desert. ""Mirrors"" the eight-minute second single off of ""The 20/20 Experience,"" evokes a soulful, ‘90s R&amp;B feel. The song takes a while to warm up, beginning as a synth-driven ballad that seems as if it would be more at home on an All-American Rejects album. The first verse, rife with cliched images, ends with an almost stalkerish declaration—""Just know that I’m always / Parallel on the other side."" JT redeems himself with a catchy hook and chorus and a slow-clap in the second half of the song. The song’s theme is perfect for JT’s comeback album, too. One can’t help but feel Timberlake is singing directly to the listener when he declares, ""I don’t want to lose you now,"" or, ""You were right here all along.""

Last weekend, up to 50,000 people rallied in Washington, D.C. to protest the creation of the Keystone XL pipeline and the expansion of the tar sands industry. This was the largest climate rally in history, and for good reason. People are finally realizing that society cannot continue to extract new forms of fossil fuels if they care at all about future generations on this planet.Unfortunately, former Harvard president and current professor Larry Summers didn’t get the memo. In a recent Washington Post opinion piece titled “The growth agenda we need,” Summers lays out a detailed four-point plan to kickstart the American economy—a plan that includes approving Keystone XL. Summers is right in saying that it is time to transform the North American energy sector. But Summers’ plan is far from transformative. Instead, it merely reinforces the dominance of fossil fuels, an energy source that is warming our planet to unprecedented levels.Summers claims that the U.S. must approve Keystone XL in order to keep tar sands from being exported to Asia, which has far fewer sound environmental regulations. This argument is flawed for two main reasons.First, it makes the assumption that the morality of our nation is relative to the behavior of other nations. This relativistic viewpoint ignores the simple facts. Burning Canadian tar sands will accelerate the dangerous effects of fossil fuels and climate change, regardless of who does it. Such environmental negligence would threaten 100 million lives by 2030. The World Bank has stated that “adaptation may not be possible” to the world we are currently on track to create. It is hardly an excuse to say that we can commit deadly sins simply because the sins of others might be worse.The second flaw in Summers’ argument is his assumption that tar sands will continue to be extracted regardless of our behavior. Tar sands can only be transported out of the heart of Canada by three routes: south, through the Keystone XL, west, through the Canadian Rockies and First Nations lands, and east, through New England. And opposition against tar sands expansion has already shown the potential to be an unstoppable force.
Thousands of people have put their bodies on the line to stop expansion to the south. Many have been arrested at the Tar Sands Blockade in Texas. Last fall, 12,000 rallied and 1,253 were arrested in Washington, D.C. to stop Keystone XL, in the largest showing of civil disobedience in 30 years. First Nations peoples of Western Canada have been steadfast in their opposition, and their enhanced legal status gives them a virtual veto over the construction of pipelines on their ancestral lands. Here in New England, Better Future Project and 350.org are working in coalition with other local and national groups to prevent ExxonMobil from shifting the direction of an oil-bearing, 60 year-old pipeline to allow it to export the heavier and more leakage-prone tar sands without the necessary presidential permit. Just two weeks ago, our groups convened over 1,500 people in Portland, Maine as the first potent display of grassroots opposition to this eastern pipeline.We need a transformation of our energy system, as Professor Summers notes. But this transition must break away from increasing fossil fuel consumption. To some it may seem like the forces of the tar sands industry are too powerful to be stopped. But there are more people fighting for a clean energy future than ever before, and our numbers are growing every day. Our society has reached a point where we can begin to understand a world destroyed by carbon fuels, and we know that this is not a path we should begin to go down.Rachel Carson said, “We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost’s familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road, the one less traveled by, offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth.”The two paths are clear before us. Which one will you choose? Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, a Crimson editorial writer and co-coordinator of Divest Harvard, is a social studies concentrator in Mather House. Craig S. Altemose is a 2010 alumnus of Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School and the Executive Director of Better Future Project.

Cass R. Sunstein ’75, a professor at Harvard Law School and former White House appointee, was selected as Harvard’s newest University Professor, the University announced Tuesday. With this distinction, Sunstein joins 23 of Harvard’s most recognized faculty members including the likes of University Professors Lawrence H. Summers, Helen Vendler, and Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr.In a press release, University President Drew G. Faust announced that Sunstein would assume the Robert Walmsley University Professorship following the retirement of Law School professor emeritus Frank I. Michelman.“Cass Sunstein’s scholarly work has cast fresh light on long-standing questions and opened new paths for legal theorists,” she said. “He is a scholar, teacher, mentor, colleague, and public servant of uncommon range and distinction.”Michelman said that he could not be more pleased by the appointment.“Cass Sunstein has made exceptional contributions to learning, to understanding, to public policy on a remarkable number of different levels,” he said. “He’s the kind of multi-faceted, well-rounded scholar and contributor that I think University professorships should recognize.”
Sunstein said the announcement came as a surprise, and that he was both “honored and humbled.”“I had in mind: teach my courses and write my articles,” he said. “It’s a great honor that Professor Faust would see fit to do this.”Sunstein, who is among one of the nation’s most cited legal scholars, has published over 30 books and hundreds of articles in a variety of legal fields including administrative law, constitutional law, environmental law, and labor and employment law.He left his position as the White House’s administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in August 2012 to return to teaching at Harvard Law School.“Working in government is the honor of a lifetime. I’ll always be grateful for that opportunity,” he said.Still, Sunstein noted that he continues to love the classroom experience.“If you have an idea that might be original and true, that’s a thrilling moment. If students have an idea that’s original and true, that’s completely thrilling,” Sunstein said, reflecting on his classroom experience. “I hope to be the best teacher that I could possibly be. And I hope that my next articles and books are as good as I can make them.”—Staff writer Zohra D. Yaqhubi can be reached at zyaqhubi@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter @zohradyaqhubi.

A mover and shaker in the Harvard Athletic Department is taking his talents to Palo Alto. Harvard Assistant Athletic Director Kurt K. Svoboda is now the property of Stanford Athletics.Stanford University Athletic Director Bernard Muir officially announced Svoboda’s hiring on Tuesday. Svoboda, who served as the Crimson’s public and media relations executive for eight years, will immediately assume a similar role with the Cardinal.During his time at Harvard, Svoboda directed the Harvard Athletic Department’s transition into the social media age, focusing on cost-effective, online productions rather than on media contracts. Svoboda was responsible for the December hiring of Imry Halevi, Harvard Athletics’ new director of multimedia and production—a position created by Svoboda.“The remaining Athletic Communications staff deserves much of the credit for the transition [to multimedia],” Svoboda wrote in an email. “We focused on changing our respective skill-sets from that of traditional and graphic design professionals to social media experts and willing multimedia and video editing students.”Svoboda added that the department “championed what is needed in today’s landscape.”
Under Svoboda’s direction, GoCrimson.com, Harvard’s athletics website, expanded its broadcasting reach. The Harvard Athletic Department has most recently added home varsity wrestling meets to its menu of over 150 live events per year. The department’s video features and productions receive 1.5 million annual views, according to a press release.Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise said that he would be sorry to see Svoboda go and credited him with making important strides in the athletic department’s multimedia broadcasting.“We’re really proud of Kurt,” Scalise said. “He made big gains in video streaming and multimedia during his time here. He stayed ahead of the technology and he’s really taking it to the next level.”In addition to his work in broadcast, Svoboda made waves on other social media platforms. In 2011, Svoboda used Twitter to encourage Associated Press pollsters to watch Harvard men’s basketball games online. The Crimson cracked the AP Top 25 for the first time in program history that year.Harvard men’s tennis coach David Fish ’72, who has coached at Harvard since 1976, acknowledged Svoboda’s role in exporting the Crimson brand.“Kurt was a dynamic force in the movement of the Harvard sports communications,” Fish said. “We went from much more of a writing-based to a web and video-based system, and he helped Harvard become the number-one, most-viewed athletics site in the Ivy League. He was dynamic, he tried to treat all the sports fairly, and he assembled a great staff of people who worked really hard for him.”During his tenure, Svoboda directly managed public relations for 12 of the Crimson’s 41 varsity squads, including Harvard’s football and men’s basketball teams. He will now oversee the communications for the defending Rose Bowl Champions.“Like at Harvard, I look forward to interacting with a large collection of bright and athletically-talented individuals,” Svoboda said. “I am extremely humbled by the opportunity. I am transitioning from the largest athletic department in the country to the most successful one. Both schools illustrate that students can have the best of both worlds athletically and academically. It is a wonderful privilege to tell that story.”The Harvard Athletic Department has named Timothy J. Williamson as Interim Director of Athletic Communications. Williamson had served as Svoboda’s assistant since December 2007.—Staff writer David P. Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Petitions for a nap space in Harvard Yard, extended dining hall hours, and weekend brain break are all slated to receive official responses from Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds, likely by the end of the semester.The student-initiated petitions were submitted to Hammonds as a part of the “We the Crimson” initiative, started by the Undergraduate Council last November. The initiative features an online portal that students can access to submit petitions and vote for other submitted petitions. At the end of each month, the top three petitions are submitted to the administration for an official response.One of the petitions, started by Yuqi Hou ’15, proposes the creation of a space in Harvard Yard for students to take naps.“People don’t realize how important it is to take a nap,” Hou said. “It improves your GPA because you’re actually more focused.”Hou first thought of the idea in December. After meeting with the Harvard Center for Wellness and Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, Hou turned to “We the Crimson” to gain student support for her idea.
Hou complemented the petition, which received 184 votes, with an online survey.Of the 432 students from across the University who responded, only 21 percent felt well-rested on a typical day. Almost 60 percent of those surveyed were in favor of a designated nap room in the Yard.However, some students who were supportive of the petition also voiced concerns.Harry W. Hild ’16, supporter of the idea, pointed out that 96 students ranked cleanliness of the nap cushions as the most important factor.“I’m not sure I’d want to hop on someone else’s beanbag after they’ve used it,” he said.Two other petitions from January were submitted to the Dean for response.One petition, which received 238 votes as of Sunday, asks for at least one dining hall to offer service until midnight.“I’m kind of a night person and often times a 7 p.m. closing time for dinner is pretty early,” said Michael F. Trang ’14, who started the petition.The other petition asks for the brain break service to include the weekend.As a Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisor, Margaret E. Crane ’14, who proposed the petition, questioned why brain break isn’t offered on weekend nights.

Karen Russell’s latest work, “Vampires in the Lemon Grove,” is built from puzzle pieces. Each component—one of eight short stories—is simple, shaped by simple plots, colored in by simple characters. Each tells a separate tale, of age-old vampires, tattoos with the ability to alter the past, women who produce silk like worms. Each suffers a similar flaw: underdeveloped characters and heavy-handed messages. Fit together, however, the simple pieces transform into a complex picture of fate, human agency, overcoming the past, and the power of story. While intriguing as a whole, the flaws marking individual parts ultimately detract from the collection’s merit.“Vampires in the Lemon Grove” is never uninteresting, not for its plot twists or artistry, but simply for Russell’s creativity in coming up with storylines. The author alternates between magical realism, realistic fiction, and fantasy in her eight stories. The premise of each is original: for example, a vampire couple who feast on lemons, a boy trying to take control of his fate from seagulls, another boy who must carry a window through a snowstorm on the frontier, a barn that holds ex-presidents in horses’ bodies, and a man explaining rules for tailgating in the Antarctic. While promising, the stories mostly fail to deliver and instead remain underdeveloped and offer little more than the originality of their plots.Exemplary of this trend is the collection’s seventh story, “The New Veteran.” The protagonist is a massage therapist named Bev who has been assigned to treat a veteran suffering from PTSD and back pain after his friend was killed in Iraq. As she treats him, his tattoo becomes animate, a moving manifestation of his pain. The more she massages it, the better he feels, but she begins to realize the cost: her own sanity. While the premise is fascinating, the delivery is lackluster. In key moments of tension, the protagonist and soldier’s responses are unexpected or even inexplicable because Russell doesn’t devote time to develop or explore the characters’ emotions except in small revelatory moments. For example, when Bev treats the soldier for the first time, he begins to tell her the story of his tattoo, playfully shifting his hips to make it move. When she starts massaging him, however, he instantly turns sour, snapping at her without reason when she asks whether the massage is helping. Moments like this never build and are never explained, and so the characters remain unsympathetic and unrealistic, nothing more than vessels for the story.The collection is as flawed in language as it is in character development. Russell does occasionally succeed in being poetic; in the first story, “Vampires in the Lemon Grove,” she writes, “Only one or two lemons tumble from the branches each hour, but I’ve been sitting here so long their falls seem contiguous, close as raindrops.” Just as often, however, her attempts at poetry leave the language overwrought and ineffective, landing in phrases like “We bump our fangs and feel like we’re coming up against the same hard truth.” When the language is neither poetic nor overworked, it remains uninteresting, offering no more than the ideas it conveys.While the individual stories suffer, Russell does well in treating the collection as a whole. Each story is connected to the rest, often referencing its predecessors in some way—for example, Bev’s friend tells her to stop acting like a whale, a remark recalling another story that concerns a fight between krill and whales. While the messages are simple when taken alone—how we cannot overcome fate, how stories can be extremely dangerous—when combined in this way, they contradict and build upon one another. Eventually, then, what Russell presents is a complex treatment of these themes that is far more interesting than what she could accomplish in any one story.
In the second story, “Reeling for the Empire,” Russell makes her most successful foray into magical realism: an agent recruits young women to work in a factory, serves them tea that turns them partially into silkworms, and leaves them with the ability to create silk from within. Toward the end of the story, the protagonist realizes that if she focuses within, she can create silk that can be used to make a cocoon that perhaps can help her free herself from her misery. Were Russell to follow her own advice and focus more on the internal workings of her stories, perhaps her collection would have surpassed its basic success and become something truly beautiful.—Staff writer Keerthi Reddy can be reached at kreddy@college.harvard.edu.

""It's so cold out here,"" one freshman grumbles, buttoning up his polo outside The Bee, ""I wish I wore a thermal. God why did I shave this morning?""""We should have pregamed in Pennypacker,"" his roommate says. ""I could use a beer blanket right now.""They are first in a line of at least 30 freshmen, which slowly grows longer as boys stumble in from the yard and as the occasional taxi arrives from BU.""Are you on the list?"" a Bee girl asks, standing in the doorway. ""This is a list party, the theme is lumber-jack-o'-lanterns. I don't see your pumpkin.""The freshman turns to his friends, a group of six boys and a girl from Canaday C-entryway. With the exception of Chris, who always wore flannel, none of them are “in theme”.
""We could try La Vie?"" Chris suggests, ""Jeff texted me, he says it’s good, lots of girls. At least five.""""I just want to get drunk with my boys and dance on a table, is that too much to ask?"" another says.While the group is discussing possible options, a pair of freshman boys linked at the elbow stumbles out of the final club.""Kathryn ignored me again,"" one of them pouts. ""Do you think I wasn't obvious enough? I kept walking past her suggestively, but it was such a sausage fest she didn't even notice me. God, I'm gonna be alone forever. Maybe I should text Jenna...""The other checks his watch. ""We should hurry. Noch's closes in 10 minutes.""The rest of the line grows impatient. There is a gentle hum of boys complaining about the wait and complimenting each other's lumberjack apparel. ""Your jack-o'-lantern is phenomenal,"" one says, ""I just don't have the facial hair to pull that off.""""Can we get in soon?"" One boy calls from the back, ""Also, I love your jeans, are they from the basement of Urban Outfitters?""The Bee bouncer, who is growing impatient herself, catches sight of a particularly young looking boy in the group and perks up. ""Freshman?"" she asks. ""I guess you guys can come in, but the girl has to stay outside.""

L'Académie française, a branch of the French government that aims to save the French language from bad, bad external cultures, has banned words like “blog” (no one was checking theirs often enough, perhaps), “supermodel,” and “hashtag.” It’s replaced hashtag with the word “mot-diese,” which, ironically enough, doesn’t even work as a hashtag. In response to these censorings, FM has compiled its own list of French things that should be #banned.1. The Farewell GreetingsMixing it up when it comes to your goodbyes is a must, but au revoir should never be acceptable, not even online. Just say “see you next time,” or whisper softly “I love you” the next time your friend walks away.2. Shaved Poodles Embarrassing for everyone involved: the owner, bystanders, the dog, and the razor.3.  Handlebar Mustaches This mustache is an invitation to steer the owner around everywhere except in the Yard, where the Handlebar Mustache must be walked. Handlebars really should only be on bikes.4. Smart CarsLike clown cars, but you can’t fit as many people in them.
5. SpeedosYou’re not swimming fast enough for people to not see your hideous bathing suit. Especially if you’re older than 25.

Hey girl… I mean, woman.Only a woman would pick at the minute differences that distinguish those two words, right? Not quite. Though used almost interchangeably, “girl” and “woman” connote two distinct ideas of what it means to identify as female.According to the Oxford English Dictionary, “woman” is defined as “an adult female human being. The counterpart of man.” (“Man,” on the other hand, is not defined as “the counterpart of woman.” Figures.) “Girl,” however, is usually meant to signify “young woman.” Technically, those are correct. But to some, their usage in the wrong context can range from being inappropriate to just plain offensive.At the most basic level, it’s an age thing. Many refer to females as “girls” until they are around college age, then switch to the term “young women.” When females reach the dreaded age of thirty, they are referred to as, simply, “women.”For the sake of having a pop culture reference to work with, let’s look at HBO’s acclaimed/decried show about the lives of four twentysomethings in New York City. The main characters are routinely portrayed as whiny and careless. Like anyone who refuses to grow up, they keep stumbling, not quite coming to terms with the fact that there’s more to life than their small, racially homogeneous social circle. Perhaps not coincidentally, the eponymous title dubs these characters “Girls.”
Whether having the title speak to the blatant capriciousness that is associated with being a “girl” is a deliberate stroke of Lena Dunham’s creative genius is up to you. Her choice to equate “girls” with puerility and immaturity is not unlike tropes such as the “girl next door,” a “girly girl,” or the high school favorite “Girls Gone Wild.""""Woman,” then, serves as a contrast to this youthful depiction of females. Second-wave feminists, especially, preferred the term: they emphasized the drawbacks of using a term like “girl” when talking about females, for it implies a certain docility that they believed stripped women of control. In any case, “woman” is meant to indicate an acquired sense of maturity and self-respect that “girls” lack.Professor of Anthropology Susan Greenhalgh believes that the “girl/woman” problem “highlights the limits of our language.”""The terms 'male' and 'female' are gender-neutral, but not especially desirable for describing social issues, since they signal biological aspects of gender,"" she said in an email, because she was unavailable to meet with FM this weekend. ""For college-aged 'males,' we have the helpful term 'guys,' which allows us to avoid both 'men' and 'boys.' For 'females,' there is no similar term (the comparable term, 'gals,' having gone out of fashion a long time ago), forcing us to choose between 'girls' and 'women.'""While there may indeed be ways to add misogynistic undertones to “woman” as well, there seems to be less implicit devaluation in the term. It might have to do with how the concept of being a “woman” is also connected to motherhood—and we’re all supposed to respect our mothers. As comedian Louis C.K. eloquently puts it, being a “woman” is “when people come out of your vagina and step on your dreams.”To Greenhalgh, the potential pitfalls of the word “woman” are outweighed by the term’s benefits. ""Either we need to reshape the meanings of our language or we need to introduce a new term,"" she said. ""I vote for young women to embrace the term 'woman' and work harder to create meanings around it that are positive and empowering.""More recently, however, pop culture has attempted to reclaim the word “girl” and liken it to the respectability that accompanies “woman.” One need look no further than Beyoncé’s almost annual female empowerment track release, “We Run the World (Girls),” or the Tumblrverse’s “Feminist Ryan Gosling,” which depicts “girls” as both intelligent and playful, in control and with a splash of youthful sass—the best of both sides of the “girl/woman” divide. To give you a better sense of what we mean, try a telling meme quote attributed to the sensitively imagined stud himself: “Hey girl. Derrida thinks language is fluid enough to break the gender divide, but nothing will split us apart.”Well said, boy.

The night before Jean Berko Gleason’s final exam in a competitive class, she could not sleep. The phone in her dorm room was ringing every 10 minutes, into the early morning. But whenever she picked up the phone, the caller—one of the male students in her class, she was convinced—hung up.“I hope they’ve fixed Cabot since I was there,” says Gleason, Radcliffe ’53. “It was just horrible.” Although Gleason was not a fan of the tiny bathrooms and bunk beds, her sentiment reflects a distaste for the restricted social space Radcliffe women were allowed during her years as a student on Harvard’s campus.In the early ’50s, women at Radcliffe were expected to abide by codes that extended beyond a strict curfew: They could not wear pants into Harvard Square or below the second floor of their buildings past 5 p.m., try out for bands or be elected as official editors of The Harvard Crimson, or even study in Lamont Library. “Harvard thought that if we were there, the men would become so excited that they wouldn’t get any work done,” Gleason says with a laugh. But Radcliffe’s women were determined: Every year, she remembers, a group of Radcliffe students would dress up as men and sit in Lamont until they were thrown out.“It was true that we were second-class citizens in a lot of ways,” says Lilla Waltch ’53, one of Gleason’s classmates. Life at Radcliffe wasn’t miserable, of course; restrictions from Lamont meant that students planned study dates at Widener and then went out for beer together after. (Still, Harvard men often disregarded Harvard women: “They always said they didn’t want to take out Radcliffe girls and that they’d rather go to Wellesley,” Waltch says.)Radcliffe women acknowledged that they were receiving an education for which they could be grateful, but it was one that perpetuated stereotypes about women’s roles in the workplace, such as encouraging women to enroll in courses at the Radcliffe Secretarial School. Waltch recalls that Radcliffe students took turns wearing hairnets and serving their classmates in the dining hall, “being on bell” to take phone calls as they came in and sending them to the appropriate floor, and remained under close watch of a house-mother, a practice not mirrored in the men’s river dorms. Gleason remembers that the social relations class she took her freshman year was the same exact course taught on Harvard’s campus at 10 a.m., but the professor trekked to Longfellow Hall to teach it at 11 a.m., separately, for women.
Once most classes became coeducational in 1950, Waltch and Gleason’s sophomore year, their male classmates snickered: They insisted that when professors said, “Good morning” to the class, the men returned the greeting, while the women wrote it down in their notes.Gleason stresses that Radcliffe and Harvard were never distinct schools; rather, Radcliffe was just a means by which women could attend Harvard. “By having the fiction of Radcliffe,” Gleason says, “Harvard was allowed to discriminate against women, long after it should have stopped—just because they were let in through another door. Harvard may have been at the forefront of scholarly things, but it was not at the forefront of civil rights.”The restrictions imposed on women’s access to Harvard were not applicable in the opposite direction: “Men could come and go as they pleased,” Gleason says—they had open access to Radcliffe’s library, for instance. “They were free people, and we were not.”Real structural change would come later, but attitudes among those attending Radcliffe were already shifting. “Don’t think we didn’t notice. The women’s movement came at a time when many people had been brewing over these things for a long time.”*******It was, Carol R. Sternhell ’71 insists, as if she had stepped from the ’50s into the ’70s from one day to the next. When Sternhell was a freshman living in Barnard Hall in the Radcliffe Quad, students still lived under the restrictions of curfews, sign-ins, and house mothers. But two years later, the University undertook an experiment: 150 Radcliffe women moved into rooms in Lowell, Adams, and Winthrop, and 150 Harvard men moved up Garden Street into the Quad, in an attempt at integration beyond the classroom. (The University only afterward added a bus serving the Radcliffe Quad.)“All the rules were gone in every aspect of life,” Sternhell says. Sternhell, who had moved to Adams House and later became the second female managing editor of The Crimson, already considered herself an activist, though she wasn’t focused particularly on gender: “We were fighting for so many things at once, and this was part of it: freedom, freedom, freedom.“Even with the increased liberties for women on campus, Esther Dyson ’71-’72 noticed certain reinforcements within the deterioration of these norms. “It was the ’60s,” Dyson, another Crimson editor, explains. “It was certainly a world where we were supposed to be decorative, and the boys were supposed be smart.” Dyson does not remember being too confined by this conception, though. She does remember attending student-worker alliance meetings, swimming naked in Adams pool every morning, and “kidnapping” Hasty Pudding Theatricals Man of the Year Dustin Hoffman from a party.Radcliffe women were negotiating space for themselves beyond the river houses—a role in which women could speak and impact change outside of the classroom. One of Sternhell’s most vivid memories is reporting on the student takeover of University Hall in 1969. “Do I remember any classes?” she jokes. “Not really. Do I remember any protests? Many.” Dyson, too, says she “rarely went to class.”It was a dramatic environment, Sternhell says, one in which she and her classmates ""felt we had to save the world."" There was already a revolution of sorts that had seeped into campus and spread. But it was a movement that Sternhell believes wasn’t analyzed or recognized at the time: the growing conceptualization and consciousness of modern feminism. “We stopped calling ourselves girls and started calling ourselves women, overnight,” she explains. “It was revolutionary to say women should have equal rights—it was unbelievable.”By senior year, Dyson says she had grown up, and Sternhell says she was indignant. They were Radcliffe students who went to school at Harvard; they weren’t going to spend their lives answering phones. Sternhell and her classmates would wear raised fist silk-screenings on the back of their graduation gowns to advocate for equal admission of women to the University. They were revolutionaries: They were feminists.This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:CLARIFICATION: February 24, 2013An earlier version of this article stated that Radcliffe women could not try out for organizations like The Harvard Crimson in the early 1950s. To clarify, while the first woman was not elected as an official editor of The Crimson until 1959, female students could contribute to The Crimson as Radcliffe correspondents beginning in 1947.

1:04 a.m.: It is so cold that I can’t feel my legs. Poor decision to choose the stone steps next to John Harvard, but he’s quiet company and so I sit. He looks out over the snowy Yard nonchalantly, observing the small mountain ranges of snow that have formed between dry pathways. I have not really looked at the Yard in John’s serene way for a long time. Its magic is lost on me during the hectic daytime, as I rush to turn in a problem set or actively avoid tourists. But tonight, as I attempt to return feeling to my toes, I am once again enchanted. The Yard is surprisingly quiet for being the “historical and geographical center of campus,” as tour guides like to say. Maybe it’s the weather, or perhaps the fact that it’s Valentine’s Day, but there is barely anyone treading these paths except for a lone pair returning from a late night of work.1:07 a.m.: I check my watch; I am here for 12 more minutes. I am taking notes about everything, and everyone I see, as if I haven’t walked through this yard a million times before. And it’s then that I notice the most beautiful aspects of this ancient place. The way the reflections of the street lights dance on the first floor windows of Grays, the strong facades of Matthews and Weld, their scale more comforting than intimidating. There is a melody to the Yard at night: the sound of Hollis’ doors thudding as they close, the distant urban murmur from the Square, the low conversations of neon-clothed Securitas guards. The aged gates that surround this yard create a silent safeness, serving as a threshold rather than a barrier; crossing this threshold from the outside world, you enter into an enclave of stillness and calm, of respite.1:15 a.m.: Four more minutes. Still cold. Though I am convinced of the quiet calmness of this place, I am still expecting at least a sampling of errant, drunk freshmen to stumble by the John Harvard statue and consider peeing on it. I am mostly disappointed until a strangely dressed freshman male struts past. Clad in a hockey jersey and flags tied around his wrists, he is the most uncommon thing I’ve seen in the last 11 minutes. He swaggers more emphatically when he spots his audience of one, almost dancing past the statue and on his merry way.1:19 a.m.: It’s time to go. I am mostly glad because my extremities are frozen, but partly glum to leave my observation post. There is comfort in knowing that this space is always here for me to pass through—to sit down and observe. When I give them the time, the minute details bring the grandness and the history of this yard to life. I am humbled and reminded of my enchantment with these tall elms, with these ornate buildings, with this still safety. I pack up and turn left, wandering down the dark paths and eventually through the gates.

<span style=""white-space: pre;""> “We have talked a bit about the vulva, which makes me kind of feel uncomfortable,” says Mason S. Hsieh ’15, chuckling with a mixture of boyish embarrassment and self-deprecation. “I don’t have one,” he continues, “but you know, it’s kind of theoretically fun.”<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Such is the ostensible plight of the male enrollee in Anthropology 1882: “The Woman and the Body,” a course title that likely evokes horrifying anatomical analysis and indignant feminist angst in the male mind.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> <span style=""white-space: pre;""> That “cult of the feminine” image is a far cry from the hospitable environment Susan Greenhalgh, a professor of Anthropology, establishes in class. Despite its alleged lecture format, the course often feels far more like a large-scale seminar, with Greenhalgh requesting not only theoretical analysis, but also personal commentary from her students. Her openness encourages the class to draw on their own experiences as they engage with the material. When two images of Serena Williams project on the screen, 10 hands shoot up, and the room fills with the women’s testimonies on athletic feminization.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> The male students, four out of 83 this semester, are far from mute acolytes. Three comment over the course of an hour, one citing a female family member, another challenging the claim that shopping functions as a unifying experience. To do so, he speaks of the sartorial history he shares with his father.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Indeed, many female students find a male lens on this material critical. Helen C. Clark ’15, who took the course last year when there were no male enrollees, notes how a different perspective can break women out of their “bubble of awareness,” highlighting which concepts men find alienating.
<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Greenhalgh cites males as some of her most frequent contributors. Both Hsieh and Nathan H. Pointer ’15, another male student in the class, say they feel empowered rather than burdened to represent a male lens. Such a focus runs the risk of essentializing them, but their tendencies to speak from the first person and even resist expected masculine perspectives belies that claim.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Empowerment, beloved contribution, and wonderful male-female ratios create a delightful ambiance to be sure. But these brave men must have little connection to the material. Cue vulva slide.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> However, lectures range across many topics that are pertinent to both genders. For example, Greenhalgh leads discussions about non-gendered Foucaultian power theories and the definition of “biocitizenship,” a gender-neutral term denoting the moral and productive member of society as both healthy and policing the health of others.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Greenhalgh’s course may be founded on feminist theory, but a shifting cultural discourse on the “obesity epidemic” in America has increased its relevance to men.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> On the disconnect between this pertinence and male enrollment, Pointer says, “Everyone can relate to this kind of material. What’s disappointing is that once you enter the WGS department not many people do. It’s mostly women. Well, it’s women and sexual minorities, honestly.”<span style=""white-space: pre;""> While Anthro 1882 is not actually housed within the WGS department, these isolating concerns ring true here as well. Men who take the course and others like it tend to already identify as feminists or allies. Greenhalgh notes that all the male students she has spoken to in “The Woman and the Body” have been gay. While understanding gender power structures is, of course, edifying to such communities, the class runs the risk of preaching to the choir. Presumably, the population that could benefit the most from this material, both personally and societally, is that of heterosexual males.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> “I think that’s one of the main points of WGS: How do you disseminate that information?” says Pointer, though he, like many others, seems unsure of how to achieve such an end, except to allow the nascent course to grow in notoriety and popularity.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> One potential route may involve emphasizing how gender dynamics are critically interlaced with other domains such as race and class. As Greenhalgh points out, “These are postmodern times when our understandings are far more fluid and contingent.”

<span style=""white-space: pre;""> After Elizabeth Warren's hard-fought race for Senate, the most expensive in the nation's history, many supporters had high hopes for her early days in office. But after her dramatic win against incumbent Scott Brown, Warren has shied away from the limelight. In the early days of the new session of Congress, her presence in the national spotlight has faded, leaving some to speculate about possible reasons for her absence.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> During the campaign, Warren was known for her fierce stump speeches criticizing the Republican Party for its ties to big money—Warren has been a staunch advocate for financial reform and regulation in her tenure as a Harvard Law professor.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> But she has not maintained the barrage of impassioned (opponents say 'canned') lines issuing from the bully pulpit. Rather, Warren has assumed a low public profile in the opening weeks of the 113th Congress. She has given few interviews to national media outlets. She has only appeared in two press conferences since the beginning of the session, both to discuss Richard Cordray's renomination to the directorship of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (In 2008, Warren played a crucial role in drafting the structure of the CFPB.) Though Warren jumped to the forefront of the public spotlight on February 14 when The Huffington Post posted a video of the senator scolding bank regulators, she has continued to decline opportunities for public statement.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Political observers have taken note of Warren’s silence.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> On February 13, Politico published an article titled “Elizabeth Warren's quiet plan for the Senate,” wondering whether it all might be part of some larger plan. The article's thesis is a two-parter: one, that Warren has flown under the radar on purpose, and two, that her purpose is to prove that she's not a “bomb-thrower.”
<span style=""white-space: pre;""> But perhaps Warren has not spent more time in the limelight simply because there is not much of a limelight for what she is doing. “The nitty-gritty of politics sometimes is not that interesting to the average person,” said Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, a Boston political veteran.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Warren now spends most of her time on exactly those nitty-gritty details: attending committee hearings, familiarizing herself with procedure, scheduling and rescheduling meetings. Her primary role is no longer that of the incendiary leader, the Democratic rallying cry.<span style=""white-space: pre;""> Said DiCara, “It's not easy being a rookie senator.... [Warren is] going through orientations...and there's not that much going on yet.”

""Five years ago I was presenting to a group of 160 managing directors, all women, in New York. I was the only man. I have to say it was a humbling experience presenting and participating—truly transformational. I never anticipated being in the minority based on gender. I’ve been the minority in so many different ways, growing up in another country. But this was really different.”Harvard Business School Professor Boris Groysberg continues to describe his discomfort throughout the all-female conference, after which he approached one of the female organizers of the event to explain how strange it had felt for him to be such a minority. She responded, “Well, now you finally understand how women feel every single day.”Groysberg sits in a rolling office chair. Tall towers of printer paper surround him on all sides as he elaborates on why he felt so out of place at this conference of female managing directors. He recalls how after joining a breakfast table at the conference the conversation completely died. While walking away from the table after eating his meal, he noticed that the conversation at the table he vacated was picking back up. His outsider presence was significantly changing the group dynamic.“I always hated inequality, but I always understood it as more of an analytical point about fairness and many other things. That was the time when gender inequality became not only analytical but also emotional. I experienced it,” Groysberg says. “I don’t remember any other project that moved me so much and made me question a number of other things.”*****
It was a typical day of math team practice at The Dalton School in Manhattan until a teacher interrupted practice looking for girls to join the school’s brand new computer science department. A high school freshman at the time, Anne W. Madoff ’15 loved math and decided she would go ahead and give computer science a try. Now a sophomore at the College, Madoff is concentrating in computer science—a predominantly male field.“Before coming to college, I had never noticed that I was a woman in an academic setting. I don’t think I would have called myself a feminist—it wasn’t a cause that I took any interest in. And then when I got to Harvard and started sitting in computer science classrooms where all of a sudden it was all guys and then me, I paid attention. If I noticed it, and I felt uncomfortable, other people must have.”*****In 2013, the national debate regarding the equality of women in the workplace still rages, with countless studies, women’s leadership initiatives, and op-eds in many major publications proving the relevance of this question. While many college women today aspire to be Fortune 500 CEOs, the data surrounding women in the workplace is dispiriting: Women hold less than 15 percent of executive positions at S&amp;P 500 Companies, and female workers receive 81 percent the salaries of their male counterparts.Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Princeton professor and the former Director of Policy Planning for the U.S. State Department, initially believed that any ambitious woman could rise to the top of her chosen field. But working one level under Hillary Clinton while simultaneously raising two teenage boys led Slaughter to a breaking point: She resigned after two years in Washington. Her lingering frustrations from the gendered world she experienced in DC inspired her to write the now ubiquitous article, “Why Women Still Can’t Have it All,” the cover story of The Atlantic in July/August 2012. It soon became the most-read story in the publication’s history.In addition to the national media coverage of her story, Slaughter explains to FM that the individual responses to her article were staggering: “I didn’t expect how many women would write me and say they thought they had really failed because they couldn’t have it all: a career with no tradeoffs and a family,” she says. “These were women who felt like it was their fault. But it wasn’t.”Along with Slaughter, Facebook CFO Sheryl Sandberg has emerged as another leading voice in the national conversation about women’s empowerment in the professional world. In her 2011 commencement address at Barnard College, Sandberg warned the 800 female graduates of workplace inequality, urging them to take charge of their own careers and find spouses who will stand by their sides. Since the speech, Sandberg has been busy speaking publicly about women’s issues and writing a book on the subject, “Lean In,” which will be released this March.Every year, Harvard graduates a new class of ambitious women, many of whom are striving to reach the top of their respective fields. Some female students acknowledge that gender may influence their career trajectories, but prefer not to address the issue now while they are still young undergraduates. Others simply do not think their gender will have an impact. But the data surrounding the issue, as well as stories by Slaughter and the countless women who responded to her article, appear to contradict such hopes.Fifty years after the publication of Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique” and the admission of women into Harvard Business School’s full-time MBA program, Slaughter urges the younger generation of American women not to ignore the role of gender in the workplace. “My judgment was that having this conversation and turning it into action is the only way to get to the next step,” Slaughter insists. “We have to get beyond 20 percent of women at the top.” A Dangerous Fiction

The start of our night could have come straight out of  one of Non Sequitur’s “Famous Last Words” strips. The ones where the last phrases people utter before they find themselves six feet under are etched on gravestones over their heads for all eternity:“Let’s go on an adventure…”It was the ellipsis. That should have been enough to tip us off. There is no grammatical structure in the world more dangerous than an ellipsis. It is, after all, the invisibility cloak of the English language. An audible dot, dot, dot…and no one knows what’s happening. Besides, we had more important matters on our mind. Boredom is all consuming.Arm in arm, the three of us sat on the common room couch. Our heads lolled against the plain white wall behind us, eyes rolled back in our heads from the sheer exhaustion of a week spent immersed in the busy endlessness of life and schoolwork. It was 10 p.m. on Friday. We were in college. Everyone else in the world had either gone out or gone to bed.Not us though. Too tired to go out, too stubborn to go to bed, there we sat, stewing in our discontent.  Until it started up: the thinking.
It began with a walk. Because all adventures must begin somewhere, and we didn’t have bikes, and we didn’t have cars, and cabs are too expensive, and to take a train, you need to know where you’re going, and we didn’t know where we were going. So we started to walk.It was early December. We had on fleeces but no coats, hands but no gloves, heads but no common sense. And so we kept walking until we ended up at MIT. Because around here no matter which way you head you will eventually end up at school—maybe not your school, but school nonetheless.At MIT, we ended up at one of those outdoor staircases. The ones that are made out of concrete with shiny, steely smooth handrails running down the middle for grasping onto. In that instant, when we saw that handrail, all three of us had the same thought. All at once, we reverted to being nine years old again.I once promised my mother that I would be as much a child at 90 as I was at nine. It was a warm day, and I had been picking forget-me-nots, which I still called “forgive-me-nots” at the time—one of those last childhood idiosyncrasies I was slow to give up. The morning had been spent on the backyard swing set, the afternoon skipping around, climbing the plum tree and chasing our cats while my mother gardened. It was a day of simple delights. Was this not all that life had to offer? That senseless, inexplicable, unstoppable joy of childhood, I decided, would be my own measure of success. If I could still call that sense of wonder to me when I had a stooped, crooked back and salty grey hair, I would have lived as I should.Now, my two friends and I stood at the top of the stairs, looking at each other for a good quarter of a second before we lunged, each one of us grabbing for the top of the handrail. I got there first, I think. To be honest, I don’t remember. It didn’t matter. What matters is that we slid down that handrail and raced back up those stairs again, over and over and over, giddy with the novelty of it. For 10, 15 minutes we just kept going and going. What matters is that I was nine years old again. What matters is that our hands were so cold when we stopped that they were shaking and we had to shove them into our coat pockets so we could push forward, because there was no way we were going back after that.We pressed on, and soon found ourselves at the Harvard Bridge. The whole bridge is 364.4 Smoots plus or minus one ear—to use the unit of measurement invented in a historic 1958 MIT prank—and we only made it through the first 180 before the race started. One of us broke ahead, and the other two chased, arms pumping, fighting for air, pushing ahead, scrambling, dissolving in laughter. We shed our 19-year-old selves again as we collapsed into each other, wheezing from cold and carefreeness. We were so out of breath that we had to walk all the way back across and start trekking home along the Charles, intoxicated by life and adventure.Noses dripped; hands shook with the cold. It was long past midnight. At last we sensibly headed home towards sleep and maybe a cup of hot chocolate. The night was done and life was good.Then, we saw the shopping cart, idling alone under a single low lit street lamp. It sat sweetly between a playground and an empty parking lot of smooth black asphalt. It beckoned, it begged, it pleaded. It drew us round in a worshipful circle. Within a minute we were pushing each other in it, taking turns, climbing in and out, seeing how fast we could go, toying with the line between perfect freedom and perfect insanity. We may have crossed it, I can’t really say. Here we were. Life was ours.And then it wasn’t. We lay sprawled across the asphalt. Knees in shreds, elbows the color of tomato paste, eyes beginning to tear, starting to lose that Mad Hatter gleam they’d been hinting at all night.  Beside us the cart lay upturned, wheels still spinning treacherously. We got up gingerly, arms around each other, grimacing slightly, grinning wide.Three hours and we’d lost 10 years. 30 seconds, and we had them back again. Aventure, as I said, is a dangerous, dangerous creature. At 19 years old, we had been nine for the night, and scraped knees were all we had to show for it.Lily C Sugrue ’16, an FM staff writer, is a first-year living in Straus Hall. Her favorite song, funnily enough, is not “We Are Young” by fun.

Memorial Hall—a massive structure that commemorates the lives of Harvard alumni lost in the Civil War, feeds freshman, and attracts performers from around the world to the Sanders Theater—has undergone a series of changes since its conception. FM returns to The Crimson’s archives to explore Memorial Hall’s history and to imagine the memories made there through the years. October, 1874: The College’s new dining club meets in Memorial Hall.This massive building—reminiscent of a church, topped with peaks and spires—commemorates those lost in the War. It is still somewhat controversial that only the Union men are remembered, a fact that is sure to be one of the topics under discussion at the Dining Club tonight, perhaps murmured under hushed breath while students are served their roast beef.The largest room in Memorial Hall is a splendid place to host the new dining club, many students think; the arching ceilings, high windows, and assorted paintings remind its members of their stern and white-wigged ancestors. Among the diners are men who carry themselves with a similarly luxurious air, speaking of their fathers’ plantations back at home. They whisper disdainfully of the outcome of the War, or lament that their deceased kin are not memorialized by the Hall.
After several meetings of the Dining Club, it becomes evident that even these men, who seem to blur together in a general clatter of spoons and forks, laughter and shouts, can be dichotomized into three distinct types, categorized and analyzed by current Crimson editors. One kind was influenced by his childhood etiquette classes and eats very delicately: His elbows remain off the mahogany tables, napkin tucked into collar, a flurry of “please” and “thank you”s. A second type appears to be consumed with the notion that this is his last meal, that his fellow diners are  his disciples in this da Vinci moment.He eats at an alarming pace, asking for more before he has swallowed whatever grotesque matter he is chewing. This type uses his napkins the least, although he appears to require them the most. A third type forgets the existence of knives and mashes meals with the side of a fork. An unconscious effort, yet a messy and undignified one all the same.Both those who criticize and favor the club worry about its future attendance rates; it is costly to dine in the great Hall. It has been suggested that games and prizes be administered at each meal in order to ensure attendance. Students doubt that Memorial Hall will ever be a major dining destination.April, 1932: Memorial Hall has recently been hit with a series of pranks.The most notable of these pranks featured an ancient clapper’s being stolen from Memorial Hall’s bell. The bell’s newfound silence, while  welcomed by those in dorms near the building, is causing quite a ruckus among the staff and administration. It appears that the thieves gained entry into the Hall through the most innocent of entrances—Sunday morning church services, of all things—to then commit the peculiar sin of lowering the entire bell apparatus and removing the clapper.The students have found it strange not to hear the tolling of the bells these past few days. Weekly practices at the pistol range in Memorial Hall’s basement seem somehow changed—many have come to rely on the vibrations that seem to shake the whole foundation as the signal for the end of their sessions. The lack of bells is a reminder of the oddity of the structure itself: a pistol range in the basement, an almighty bell above, church services in between.One question at hand concerns how the robbers managed to steal such a large piece of equipment while the rest of the students sat quietly in sermon. Speculative conversations have pegged the theft on Yalies, still sore from the last Game Day prank. The administration believes it was a group of technically-inclined grad students who were overeager to show off their wits and expose the University’s weak spots.March 1966: Whether it’s a trend of universities alone or human nature itself, everything old seems in constant danger of being destroyed in order to make room for the new.As the University ramps up efforts to fund new projects such as an underpass beneath Cambridge Street, it seeks space to remove old buildings and replace them with shiny new ones that will invoke the honor and the prestige of the University. Mem Hall is the latest target.Mem Hall—the place where students have eaten since freshman year, seen concerts at Sanders, and met up between class—is Harvard’s geographical heart. Yet rumors have been circulating that the administration finds it an ugly, archaic piece of architecture, and that they toasted to its demise when the building went up in flames in the ‘50s. It has since been restored, memorialized, and lauded by alumni. But these days, few doubt it will be saved from the impending bulldozers. Dissenting students complain that only at Harvard  would a massive, functional, memorial building be torn down because professors and officials find it aesthetically displeasing.As much as some students love Mem Hall, it’s going to be the alumni who will have to fight for its continued existence. Current students are glued to the TV, or to the papers: Some joke about the fact that they may be sent to Vietnam before they’re handed a diploma.Whatever its fate, Mem Hall continues to be saturated with over a century of memories. Without a tangible structure to hold them, students wonder, where will its stories and people go when it’s gone?

Lawrence G. Wright has traveled all over the world, but he still speaks with a Texas twang. On Jan. 31, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author spoke at the Brattle Square Theatre about his latest book, “Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, &amp; the Prison of Belief.” Between several book talks and a trip to London, FM caught up with Wright over the phone to ask him about his career and the controversies surrounding his new book.1. Fifteen Minutes: How did you first become interested in pursuing writing as a career?Lawrence G. Wright: It happened when I was in ninth grade in Dallas, Texas. I had an English teacher who would write little essays, which I thought were delightful. It was the first time I really considered the possibility that writing could be my life.2. FM: You’ve written magazines features, screenplays, stage plays, and books. How does your writing style vary throughout each medium?LW: Fundamentally, it’s all storytelling. For me, it’s very helpful to have the experience of writing in different mediums. Each form enriches the other. What I learned from writing non-fiction was how to research. What I learned from writing plays and movies was the importance of theme and character in telling a story.
3. FM: What was it like conducting research for “The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11”?LW: Writing “The Looming Tower” was more of a mission than just taking on a book. I had co-written a movie called “The Siege” with Bruce Willis and Denzel Washington and it prefigured a lot of what happened on 9/11. I had lived in the Arab world, so in some ways I was not uniquely qualified, but unusual in terms of my experiences. I thought I should go and try to find out what had actually happened. I really wanted to get it down and get it right. Writing that book taught me a lot about journalism and how to write that kind of book.4. FM: You taught in Cairo for two years when you were much younger. Did your experiences in Egypt influence your writing of “The Looming Tower”?LW: The culture wasn’t that exotic to me; I’d lived in it. I felt like I could write more authentically about the personalities, especially Al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda’s number two guy at the time. I felt like I was much more acquainted with those personalities than a lot of people would have been because I had taught there, had a lot of Egyptian friends, and loved the culture.5. FM: What was it like to perform your one-man show, “My Trip to al-Qaeda”?LW: When I finished “The Looming Tower,” a lot of people asked me, “What was it like to talk to those people and what were your experiences?” I realized I hadn’t processed that thought myself, and I hadn’t really had time to sit down and think about how the experience had changed me. I decided that this would be a way for me to explore these questions as well. I like the intimacy of theatre. I call what I did nonfiction theater. This was really a blending of documentary filmmaking with the actual theatrical experience.6. FM: Summarize your new book “Going Clear” in 15 words.LW: Why do people join Scientology? What do they get from it? Why do they leave?7. FM: What prompted you to write about Scientology?LW: In America we can believe anything that we want, and in a lot of countries that’s not true. In America we have so many different religions, and we are constantly inventing new ones. I had written a good deal about religion in the past. I’ve written about the Amish and the Mormons, the Southern Baptists and the Pentecostals. I’ve really done a lot of writing about religion because I think that religion is much more accountable than politics in terms of shaping actual behavior and changing society. I was interested in Scientology for years, and I was looking for a way to get into the story. When Paul Haggis talked out, I thought there—that’s my way in.

Although the Harvard basketball team stole most of the weekend headlines with its important victories over Ivy League rivals Penn and Princeton, a few other Crimson teams had equally impressive weekends.
<a name=""jump"">
Men’s Volleyball entered the AVCA Division I-II poll at No. 15 after a weekend sweep, including a dominating 3-0 beatdown of conference rival No. 9 Penn State on Friday night. It was the first time in 51 conference matches—spanning almost five years—that the Nittany Lions lost a conference matchup, and the first time in history that Harvard had defeated Penn State. The Crimson returned to the national rankings for the first time since last season after finishing its weekend with a sweep of St. Francis. Sophomore outside hitter DJ White won the AVCA National Player of the Week after hitting .477 for the week with 4.17 kills per set. Harvard has won seven straight matches at home stretching to last season, and is a half-game behind George Mason in the EIVA standings.
Men’s Swimming and Diving capped an undefeated dual meet season with a victory over Penn last weekend and not only earned the No. 16 spot in the NCAA rankings, but also won the outright claim to the Ivy League Dual Meet title. The defeat of Penn, in which the Crimson won first place in 12 of the 16 events, was preceded by one of the most impressive wins in program history. Harvard defeated Princeton at the HYP dual meet, and became the first Ivy opponent to defeat the Tigers at home. The team will now prepare for the ECAC Championships, which it will host March 1-3, before heading to Providence the next weekend for the Ivy League Championships on March 7-9.
Not to be outdone, Women’s Swimming and Diving entered the top 25 for the first time (at No. 22) after completing its own second consecutive undefeated dual meet season with a win at the HYP meet. Freshman Kendall Crawford set school records in the 100 backstroke and 100 butterfly and also took home the 200 backstroke title. Teammate Stephanie Ferrell, a sophomore, picked up wins in the 100 and 200 breaststrokes and the 200 IM. It is Harvard’s first back-to-back undefeated Ivy seasons since 2004-06. The Crimson will return to Princeton for the Ivy Championships starting February 28 and then focus on the ECAC Championships, beginning March 1.

""No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office in this state,” Mississippi’s <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-jones/an-atheist-chapaincy-a-good-way-to-begin-the-new-year_b_2366663.html"">constitution still proclaims, in words similar to those of six other state charters. Although not <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&amp;pg=PA1314&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">enforced in practice, provisions such as Mississippi’s betray the reputation of ignominy and amorality that has been attached to atheism at many points in time. Atheist Coming Out Week, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/18/harvard-atheist-week/"">sponsored by the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics, is a welcome occasion to generate dialogue on humanistic and nonreligious value systems, counter to the myth that living without God means living without morals.Though nominally a secular, pluralistic society, the prevalent rhetoric of American public life retains an unduly religious character. Presidents, judges, and civil servants take their oaths of office upon copies of sacred scriptures. The Pledge of Allegiance refers to the United States as “one Nation under God.” Banknotes bear the familiar phrase: “In God we trust.” Each of these conventions is a testament to the enduring notion that religion holds a monopoly on ethics, contributing to the perception that atheism is necessarily an anti-civic and amoral belief system.HCHAA board members Sarah E. Coughlon ’15 and Elliot A. Wilson ’15 noted in their <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/18/harvard-atheist-week/"">recent op-ed that the stigma surrounding atheism is in fact very visible, powerful, and unfounded. The writers cited a significant disparity between the 26 percent of young American adults identifying themselves with no established religion and the mere three percent willing to call themselves atheist. Part of this disparity is conceivably accounted for by a sense of unease and stigma that all too often accompanies atheism. Anecdotally, Professor of Psychology Steven A. Pinker '79 <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/19/atheists_discuss_social_stigma/"">recounted at a panel held in Lamont Library on Monday evening that his “coming out” as an atheist “felt like...confessing to murder.”Harvard, like many other secular institutions of higher learning around the country, offers an environment that is perhaps extraordinarily accepting of religious beliefs of all kinds, or lack thereof. Harvard Divinity School graduate Alan Jones was the subject of media <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-jones/an-atheist-chapaincy-a-good-way-to-begin-the-new-year_b_2366663.html"">attention in December when he was appointed an atheist chaplain at Stanford, interestingly demonstrating that even theological schools can be fertile breeding ground for secular moral thinkers.Nonetheless, some of the students who attended Monday evening’s panel on Why Atheism Matters did mention the difficulties of proclaiming oneself an atheist—even at Harvard. So deeply entrenched is anti-atheist sentiment in the U.S. that it would be unreasonable to suppose that atheism carries absolutely no stigma at Harvard.
Atheists and believers alike should never feel the need to be apologetic about their stances on religion. Atheist Coming Out Week is a very valuable initiative that we hope will raise awareness of the value of nonreligious ethics, as well as promote further dialogue and coexistence between those who seek their codes of conduct in the realm of the divine and those who don’t.CORRECTION February 22:The Crimson editorial ,“Out of the Profane Closet,” misidentified Stanford’s new Humanist Chaplain as Alan Jones. In fact, Stanford’s Humanist Chaplain is John Figdor.

“After enduring nearly a century of systematic resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress might well decide to shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of evil to its victims,” wrote former Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren in the Court’s decision on <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0383_0301_ZS.html"">South Carolina v. Katzenbach in 1966. It’s not too hard to puzzle out.  The perpetrators here are discriminatory state and local governments, and the victims are minority voters deprived of a voice at the polls.  On paper, the Fifteenth Amendment <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv"">enshrined the right of all Americans to vote regardless of color.  But in practice, the altered Constitution did not stop local legislators from twisting their voting codes to shut African Americans out of the political process.  It was not until nearly a century later, when President Lyndon B. Johnson <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php"">signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, that what was once only a theoretical right became reality.The Voting Rights Act, widely hailed as a watershed piece of legislation, changed our country’s political landscape in a profound and lasting way.  In fact, Congress considered the law effective and necessary enough to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/us/supreme-court-to-revisit-voting-rights-act.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0"">renew all of its special provisions in 1970, 1975, 1982, and most recently, in 2006, for another 25 years.  Next Wednesday, however, the Supreme Court will <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/us/supreme-court-to-revisit-voting-rights-act.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0"">hear Shelby County v. Holder and may well strike down Section 5, the heart of the act.  It shouldn’t.<a href=""http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php"">Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act identifies nine states—Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia—and a number of counties and municipalities in other states with a history of discrimination and declares them “covered jurisdictions.”  These covered jurisdictions cannot alter their voting policies without first appealing to the Department of Justice or to a federal court for “preclearance.”
Prior to Section 5’s passage, the government scrambled to keep pace with officials meddling with voting laws by suing case by case, state by state.  But those officials shifted discriminatory tactics constantly, and the government fell behind.  Section 5 put an end to that.  But now, some claim that our nation’s transition to what they see as a post-racial age has rendered the Voting Rights Act irrelevant.Opponents of Section 5, <a href=""file:///C:/Users/business/Downloads/Shelby%20County,%20Alabama"">like Shelby County, Alabama, see the provision as an un-American infringement on state sovereignty.  Their argument has some force: Holding state policy hostage to federal approval does not jibe with the federalist ideals that define our Constitution.  Indeed, if we truly did live in a land where race had faded into the background and discrimination disintegrated with it, the government could not justify stepping on states’ toes any longer.Yet we do not live in a land where race has faded to the background and discrimination with it.  Yes, the U.S. has made great strides since 1965.  And yes, its citizens have reelected a black man to sit in the Oval Office.  But no, racial prejudice is not a thing of the past.Congress did not extend Section 5 in 2006 based on a hunch.  Rather, legislators <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2012/3mer/2mer/2012-0096.mer.aa.pdf"">held 21 hearings and amassed over 15,000 pages of evidence chronicling ongoing voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions.  In Evergreen, Alabama, only hours from Shelby County, 74-year-old Jerome Grey nearly <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/us/politics/supreme-court-to-hear-alabama-countys-challenge-to-voting-rights-act.html?ref=us&amp;_r=0"">missed his chance to vote this past election.  The local government had attempted to remove him and 800 others from the voting rolls when they failed to meet certain utility requirements—measures of wealth eerily reminiscent of poll taxes during the Jim Crow era.  Luckily, Section 5 blocked the change.Federalism is an essential part of the United States’ political tradition.  But ensuring a vital democracy must trump states’ rights.  The threat of discrimination still looms large over countless Americans, and when that discrimination prevents or dilutes minority votes, the democratic process begins to break down.As the Court said in <a href=""http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html"">Yick Wo v. Hopkins years ago, the right to vote is “a fundamental political right, because [it is] preservative of all rights.”  In other words, if a citizen cannot choose who represents him, he has no power to ensure that the laws his government enacts treat him fairly.  When that citizen is a member of a class that has historically been excluded from the political process, the need to protect his voting rights is particularly pressing.  That’s exactly why the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments allow Congress the authority to enforce equality under the law through “appropriate legislation”—legislation like the Voting Rights Act.President Johnson <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965.htm"">called the Voting Rights Act “a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any battlefield.”  A Supreme Court ruling that gutted the act would be a defeat of equal magnitude.Molly L.

You do not become schizophrenic overnight. When I began to hear voices, I told myself that it was some peculiar coping mechanism that was benign and would soon go away. Around the same time I had been in an accident, was dealing with a family crisis, and as a corollary was off-and-on homeless for a few weeks. Such occurrences would make anyone momentarily mad, right? This is what I told the social worker the first time I went to Harvard University Health Services. I was depressed: These were odd shock symptoms that would heal and fade away like bruises. We never talked about the voices. It was a topic that terrified me, and she was no more eager to ask me about them. She encouraged me to drink chamomile tea and to practice breathing exercises to cope with stress.I knew I needed more help than tea, but as a poor, financially independent student from a poor family, my options were limited. I was lucky to enroll in a research study that gave me psychotherapy in exchange for serving as guinea pig for new social workers. By October 2012, I was seeing a therapist at least three times a week and sleeping the rest of the time to hide from the voices, which were getting worse and handicapping my ability to listen to my own stream of consciousness. Have you ever tried writing a paper when roommates are having a loud conversation? Now imagine they are screaming at you. This is how I feel every day. I experienced other symptoms I did not expect, such as forgetting words, and instead of my once photographic memory, I often cannot remember in the evening what I did in the morning.December came, and with it, exams and final papers. I had to pull endless all-nighters to complete the work I had missed, and forsaking sleep meant that I was abandoning the only effective refuge I had from my screaming demons. I survived by the compassion of my roommates, who made sure I was eating and would hold and soothe me when things became unbearable. After exams, I was supposed to start antipsychotics. I was surprised to find out that my insurance company would not cover the drug, which cost $850 a month. I successfully petitioned to have the drug partially covered by insurance; still, $650 a month.Even on full financial aid, I work two jobs to pay for my education, and there is no money to spare. I wrote to my financial aid officer, and he still has not responded. I made an appointment with the patient advocate, but because I am not on Harvard’s student insurance plan, nothing could be done. My resident dean could apply for a special fund, but only after my financial aid officer officially refuses my petition.Two months have passed. What can I do? My resident dean, academic advisor, and psychiatrist strongly encourage me to take the semester off. I want to, but my family situation makes living at home a non-option. Where else can I go? I am too sick regularly to be in class; how can I hold a job? I decided to stay as I fight for treatment. Harvard may not be willing to pay for treatment, but at least as a student I hope that they are too afraid of bad publicity to let me die should I need hospitalization. At least here I have food and housing through financial aid. As a student on leave, I would have no such reluctant advocate. I am lucky to have enrolled in a trial that pays for a month’s treatment, but I have no idea from where the money will come next month. I just know that I would not have survived the last month without treatment.
What they never tell you about schizophrenia is that you never really believe it, internalize it, identify with it. Mornings are agonizing because every day in the haze of waking up I briefly remember all over again who I am and what I have lost. I remember the friends that I am terrified will see me differently if I tell them; I remember that on my bad days I scare people in class and on the subway; I remember that the academic career for which I had worked is now improbable. I remember that the measure of success for too many of my days will be that I have not killed myself.So Harvard, friends, peers, anyone who might be reading this: I am asking you to advocate for me and the other statistically <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/1schiz.shtml"">70 or so students here who are struggling with schizophrenia or other acute illnesses. The average <a href=""http://www.schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm"">age of onset for schizophrenia is 18 for men and 25 for women, meaning that it often occurs during college. Most of you who are reading this assume that Harvard provides some end-of-the-line safety net for poor students in such calamitous circumstances and that Harvard would never let a student fail, drop out, or not receive medical care for lack of money. I write to assure you that there is no end in sight to the falling. I can apply for $5,000 to study bat droppings over the summer, but there is no application to pay for the treatment that enables me to function. Dear Harvard College Research Program, will you finance an application for me to study the effect of treatment on the schizophrenic brain? I know just the test subject.Scientists have not yet decoded the medical and psychiatric workings of schizophrenia, but there are a few obvious reforms Harvard could implement that would allow students like me to have the support and treatment we need to succeed and survive. These policy changes need to be implemented transparently: Currently, most leave of absence and mental health policy is nebulous, unofficial, unpublished, and only policy-as-practiced through the decisions of the Administrative Board.First, Harvard should guarantee that anyone who seeks treatment be able to see a therapist within a week, and if desired, to see a therapist on a weekly basis. Currently wait times can be as long as a month, and anecdotal evidence from friends and a conversation with a Harvard therapist suggest that they are pressured to cap the number of appointments covered by Harvard insurance. While Harvard has taken steps forward in <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/12/mental-health-time-off/"">covering up to 24 visits to outside providers, Harvard can continue this progress by hiring enough therapists at HUHS to meet student need and covering as many outside visits as are recommended by the therapist.Second, Harvard should abolish the present oft-coerced leave of absence imposed on students who admit themselves to the infirmary. Students who decide to go on leave are often unaware that in order to return, they must prove that they have held a job or internship and that they have been seeking treatment. The burden of this policy falls brutally on students from poor backgrounds, students lacking robust health insurance, and students with unstable family situations. Ironically, these are the very students who are more likely to have experienced trauma.This policy typifies the hostility with which mental illness is treated by the Harvard administration. The administration is pursuing what can—despite the University’s belief to the contrary—only be described as punitive courses of action that do not take into consideration the wellbeing of students. If your financial situation is such that Harvard is your only hope for treatment, your options are to seek immediate help and forego longer-term treatment or to try to fight through the darkest nights in hopes that maybe things will get better. I have lost too many friends at Harvard who did not survive that fight. An alternative option would be to implement a program for students on financial aid: Give us housing, allow us to stay with the therapists who know us best, and finance the program through a combination of grants, subsidized loans, and a work program.Third, the administration should guarantee reasonable turnaround times for decisions from the Financial Aid Office in emergency situations, institute a reasonable cap on health spending in a given year, and provide grants for any additional amount for students on financial aid. Need-blind financial aid allows me to attend Harvard regardless of my financial situation; it should also allow me to stay regardless of a treatable medical condition.In a recent letter, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds encouraged students to “not suffer in silence. We are here to support you.” I was not silent: I sought and was refused help. I am asking you to join me in a loud appeal to the administration for quality mental health support. If there really is such a thing as a Harvard community, then our shared resources should be allocated according to our values. If Harvard is willing to cut hot breakfast to restructure its budget, then surely mental health is important enough for us to demand adequate resources and to implement serious and necessary reforms.This is not crazy talk, but I am mad.

The Harvard Law Review, which has historically been staffed by disproportionately more men than women, has expanded its affirmative action policy to include gender as a criteria in its editor selection process.Following a year in which just 20.5 percent of its elected editors were female, the Law Review will consider gender when choosing some of its applicants for the first time ever this year.The majority of the Law Review’s returning editors approved the policy change this January in an attempt to increase the number of female editors on the staff. Because of the specific nature of the Law Review’s admissions process, the new policy will be used in choosing 12 of the Law Review’s next 46 editors.Second-year Law School student Gillian S. Grossman ’10, the recently elected president of the Law Review who will lead the organization’s 127th volume, wrote in an email that the policy change was among many considered to “enhance the diversity of the editorial body.”“Volume 127 decided that adding gender to the list of criteria considered by the discretionary committee was one good step in that direction,” she wrote.
The changed affirmative action policy was one of several initiatives passed by second-year editors last month in preparation for taking over the leadership of the Law Review. The editors also approved a change that will add two more students to this year’s pool of rising editors—increasing its size from 44 to 46—in the upcoming application process.The Law Review, whose total staff is currently 25 percent female, selects new editors using three distinct application processes. Of the 44 editors elected in recent years, 20 are anonymously selected based solely on their performance on an annual writing test administered to first-year law students after their semester ends in May. An additional 14 editors are chosen based on a combination of their writing scores and their grades.The remaining 10 spots are filled by a discretionary committee that incorporates applicants’ grades, writing test scores, race, and any physical disabilities into their decisions.But this year, the discretionary committee will fill 12 spots and consider gender in addition to its existing criteria.The first group of applicants to be elected under this changed policy will be the editors of the 128th volume, who will be selected over the summer.Grossman wrote that it remains to be seen how effective this policy will be in increasing the percentage of female editors.“Because the Law Review has not yet started the selection process for Volume 128, it’s too soon to tell what impact the policy will have,” Grossman wrote. “As a historical matter, the Law Review has tended to have a higher percentage of female editors than does Volume 127, so it is not unlikely that we would see an increase in the number of female editors in the next volume regardless of this policy, though of course we cannot know for certain.”The Law Review’s new policy comes in the midst of a national debate over race-based affirmative action in college admissions, an issue on which the Supreme Court is expected to rule this June.—Staff writer Dev A.

The average net tuition cost for Harvard undergraduate students is $18,277—the cheapest in the Ivy League—according to the new “College Scorecard” web tool that President Obama revealed in the State of the Union Address last week. The “College Scorecard” aims to give families more information on the price and value of colleges by providing an interactive tool showing what, on average, undergraduate students are expected to pay after grants and scholarships are subtracted from the school’s cost.Harvard’s net cost of $18,277 made it more affordable than Princeton ($18,813), Yale ($18,934), Columbia ($19,073), University of Pennsylvania ($20,592), Dartmouth ($20,814), Brown ($22,743), and Cornell ($24,249), as well as several of the more expensive Greater Boston schools.Harvard also offered a significantly lower median borrowing amount per student. With typical Harvard families borrowing $7,700 in Federal loans, the new interactive “College Scorecard” listed the monthly loan payback for a Harvard student to be $88.61 compared to the monthly values of the other Ivy League schools, which all exceeded $100.“Today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt,” Obama said in his State of the Union address, claiming that with this newly released “College Scorecard” parents and students can “compare schools on a simple criteria: where you can get the most bang for you educational buck.”An online tool designed by the U.S. Department of Education, the scorecard shows a college’s cost, graduation rate, loan default rate, median borrowing amount, and employment information on any school through a simple search. In the search, students and families can feed in their rankings of important qualities such as majors offered, awards offered, location, enrollment size, campus setting, etc., and then select specific institutions to see their “scorecards” which offer price tags for the schools.
“The new scorecard highlights Harvard’s considerable efforts to offer an affordable college education for undergraduates from all economic backgrounds, whether they study at Harvard College or at the Harvard Extension School,” a Harvard spokesperson wrote in an email to The Crimson.From 2007-2009, Harvard University has seen a reported decrease in average net price by 15.5%. Harvard College Office of Admissions and Financial Aid reported that for the 2012-13 academic year, the total cost of attendance for students (including room, board, and health fees) was $54,496.—Staff writer Zohra D.

Bauer Fellow Peter J. Turnbaugh and coworkers published work last month that could pave the way for techniques in “personalized medicine”—treatment which caters to an individuals’ unique genetic makeup.The paper, which was published in the research publication “Cell,” demonstrated some of the specific effects certain drugs have on microbes in the human body.The results of this study could help scientists and doctors predict and avoid side effects that may arise from their patients taking oral medication.Even with advances in medicine, there are still a significant number of drugs that come with side effects of varying degree. These side effects are difficult for scientists to eliminate because every person’s response to drugs is individualized and unique.In order to begin to understand these unique responses, Turnbaugh’s group analyzed the responses of various microbes found in the human gut, and their responses to various drugs and antibiotics.
After the microbes were treated with doses of the drugs, researchers inspected them for changes in their structure and gene expression.By noting which groups of microorganisms changed in response to the treatment, Turnbaugh’s group was able to conclude which microbes interact most strongly with a series of six drugs and eight antibiotics.Turnbaugh said that knowing these specific responses could help determine which drugs might prove damaging to specific patients.According to Turnbaugh, the techniques used in the study were relatively new, and would not have been monetarily feasible for many research groups five years ago.“There has been sort of a resurgence in the field in the last three years, primarily driven by the fact that [genetic] sequencing costs have decreased,” Turnbaugh said. “There’s a lot of feedback… and a lot of tools that tell us what genes are in [different bacteria’s] genome.”

Using data generated by planes that traveled between the North and South Poles, Harvard researchers generated the first set of highly detailed measurements of greenhouse gas levels across the globe. This comprehensive data set is now available to the public.The researchers were part of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations team, comprised of scientists from Harvard University, University of Miami, Princeton University, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Scripps Research Institute, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.“We were filling in some important new pieces of information about what controls the climate system,” said atmospheric and environmental studies professor and lead principle investigator Steven C. Wofsy.He said that, while satellites have long gathered data on carbon dioxide and other trace atmospheric gases, distance prevented them from measuring at a more refined level.The HIPPO project utilized manned flights to investigate the seasonal factors which have a significant effect on the distribution of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, said team member Gregory Santoni, a graduate student in the department of earth and planetary sciences.
Data collection took place between 2009 and 2011 in five missions, each comprised of roughly 10 to 12 flights and each of which lasted three-week flights.The flights traveled across the Pacific Basin, maneuvering through different altitudes to obtain data from a large cross section of the atmosphere.In all, the team obtained 785 vertical profiles and 4,000 flask samples from the atmosphere in over 600 hours of flight.The data set contains a number of new insights regarding atmospheric gas concentration. For instance, researchers found evidence that Southeast Asia is a vigorous source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, a fact that was previously unnoticed. According to Santoni, the data set also suggests that current models used to predict the removal of black carbon—a substance considered to significantly contribute to global warming—are inaccurate.Additionally, researchers found  evidence that, as human activity has caused the ice cover over the Arctic Ocean to recede, significant amounts of methane are being produced by previously submerged biological processes occurring on the ocean’s surface.“You wouldn’t necessarily think of human impact as being something that has a chain of events,” Wofsky said.The team is hopeful that the data set can be applied to research involving climatological issues in a number of different fields.—Staff writer Alyza Sebenius can be reached at asebenius@college.harvard.edu.

According to a recent study by a team of Harvard researchers from across the University, specialists in thermoregulation, dermatologists, and hair experts have one thing in common: the EDAR gene.Using a tool she has developed over the past several years, Pardis C. Sabeti, one of the lead researchers of the study and an associate professor of organismic and evolutionary biology, was able to identify EDAR as an evolutionary advantageous gene. With this study Sabeti and her co-workers sought to understand what makes the gene so advantageous.To clearly identify its effects on physical traits, Yana G. Kamberov, a research fellow in genetics at Harvard Medical School, isolated and implanted the single gene into laboratory mice. The resulting mice exhibited not only thicker hair and altered teeth shape but also an unexpected increase in sweat glands and diminished mammary gland sizes.EDAR’s importance to sweat glands was further confirmed by analyzing the genomes of living humans of Han Chinese descent. Those with a similarly high frequency of sweat glands also possessed EDAR.The ability to sweat bears great evolutionary significance as it is one of the characteristics that distinguishes humans from other animals. Now that the researchers have established causality between the EDAR gene and its many physical manifestations, they can begin to investigate whether sweating­—or one of the other many traits expressed by the gene—makes it evolutionarily favored.
The gene’s many roles have brought together a diverse range of specialists to collaborate on this project. From specialists in thermoregulation—how the body maintains its optimum temperature—to dermatologists to hair experts, each scientist offers a unique perspective on “why we are the way we are,” Sabeti said.“Because I work on hair, I spend a lot of time talking to cosmetic companies,” said Bruce A. Morgan, an associate professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School. “When this gene first came out—a gene that will make your hair thicker—all the cosmetic companies thought, ‘Oh, there’s the secret to life.’”Eventually, Sabeti hopes to apply her gene-identifying technology to epidemiology in an attempt to correlate certain genes with increased odds of immunity or disease-resistance. She has located over 400 candidates for evolutionarily favored genes that will potentially shed light on ways to prevent or treat illnesses.“Anything that’s been critical for our survival in the past may unlock mysteries of how to keep human survival going forward,” Sabeti said.—Staff writer Jessica A.

An advancement in soft robotics by Harvard-affiliated researchers allows these flexible robots to react faster than ever and jump more than a foot in the air.The study’s critical innovation was the incorporation of an internal gas combustion engine for the robot’s motion, according to Adam A. Stokes, one of the authors of the study. Gas combustion, as opposed to previously used gas compression, enables motion at a much faster pace. Now soft robots jump within four milliseconds of initiation.“Jumping is a side effect of exploring combustion as a propulsion and power source for soft robots,” said the study’s lead author Robert F. Shepherd, a former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard and now an assistant professor at Cornell.The three-legged robots are made of compressible material, such as silicone, that can return to its shape. Each leg contains an internal chamber that wires inject with explosive gases. In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Stokes compared the technology to the “spark plug in a car engine.” Upon gas combustion, the volume of the robot changes, exerting a force against the ground and causing the jump.This study, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,  is the latest installment in the Whitesides Research Group’s work in soft robotics. In 2011, a team of researchers under George M. Whitesides ’60 first developed <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/1/flexible-robot-harvard-squid/"">a robot to imitate the motion of a squid.
Made using 3D printers, soft robots are cheaper and more easily manufactured than hard robots. This lower price and ability to avoid obstacles will potentially make them more useful than hard robots for search and rescue missions, Shepherd said.Still, despite the large potential for soft robots, Harvard research associate and study author Jabulani R. Barber said that scientists “aren’t trying to replace hard robots.”Instead, Shepherd said that soft-robots have the ability to complement hard robots.“Soft robots are important because they will eventually allow robots to be used in places where hard robots can’t, perhaps in internal surgery,” Shepherd said.Current and future developments in soft robotics are focused on “trying out new materials and designs for crawling, jumping, gripping, color changing, and ‘looking’” Stokes wrote.

Following a recent review of undergraduate curriculum, the government department introduced two new research-oriented courses this spring to improve the quality of its thesis program.The two courses, Government 61: Research Practice in Quantitative Methods and Government 62: Research Practice in Qualitative Methods, aim to equip students with skills necessary to better conduct research in political science.Associate professor of social sciences Arthur P. Spirling, who teaches Government 61, said the course deals “primarily in how to model statistical data that the students have in their personal projects or as pertains to their theses.”Visiting associate professor Frances Hagopian, who teaches Government 62, said that the class aims both to enhance students’ familiarity with research design and to equip them with methodological techniques.Hagopian’s new course, which enrolls 19 students, most of whom are junior government concentrators, combines theoretical readings with the study of explanatory works.
Aaron E. Watanabe ’14 said that Government 62 focuses on “research design, [on] how to ask a question, [on] how to trace out causal links.”Government professor Steven R. Levitsky said the motivation for the introduction of these two courses lies in the perennial struggles of government thesis writers.“Your average honor student did not know how to write a thesis,” said Levitsky, who chaired the committee that reviewed the undergraduate government curriculum. “They started their junior year with zero training on how to do research.”The government department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch said that student demand drove the push for more research-oriented classes.“One of the things that the students told us is that they wanted both more practice and more opportunity to do research in political science,” said Welch.According to Levitsky, while undergraduates certainly expressed their concerns, many faculty members were also critical.“The old situation, prior to this class existing, of students being in this very awkward position of having to learn statistics [quickly] while they’re trying to write their thesis was not really good for their thesis writing,” said Spirling.Four weeks into the semester, students and faculty members have expressed satisfaction at the course’s progress.“It sort of filled a really important gap in the curricula they had before,” Cody R. Dean ’14, a student in Government 61. “It’s a great class...I hope they continue and grow it.”The department’s effort to offer more research opportunities began last semester when assistant government professor Ryan D. Enos and other faculty members pioneered the course Government 92r: Faculty Research Assistant. The course, which is offered again this spring, allows students to participate in research projects with faculty members.“Students do a lot of consumption of research design in government class, but they never really get to see how it comes about,” said Janet I. Lewis, a post-doctorate fellow who is assisted by two students for her comparative study of insurgent groups.“I think [Government 92r is] a fantastic window for students into the world of research, to see how the research process actually works behind the scenes,” she added.—Staff writer Francesca Annicchiarico can be reached at fannicchiarico01@collge.harvard.edu.

Earlier this week Eric S. Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard, received a call saying he had been awarded $3 million.Lander was one of 11 scientists, announced Wednesday, awarded the inaugural Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences Award, which recognizes scientists in the field of curing intractable disease and extending human life.The prize was founded by Russian entrepreneur and venture capitalist Yuri Milner in conjunction with a board of tech industry leaders, including Harvard dropout and Facebook founder Mark E. Zuckerberg.The award honored Lander for his contribution to the field of genetics. As the leader of the Human Genome Project, Lander has helped advanced the field of genomics through publically-available genome sequencing.“For the last 25 years or so I’ve been very interested in trying to understand what’s in the human genome,” said Lander. “In the last decade, the methods have just exploded. Its become possible to read out genetic information about a million times cheaper and faster than you could do before.”
The Breakthrough Prize is the most recent in a series of prizes given by Milner. Last summer, he launched the Fundamental Physics Prize, which awarded nine physicists $3 million dollars each.With the prize money, the board hopes to enable scientists to increase their engagement with the public and support other future endeavors.Lander said he plans to put some of the prize money towards EdX—the nonprofit virtual learning initiative launched by Harvard and MIT last May.Lander, who will be teaching an introductory biology course through EdX this spring, said he wants his EdX course to not only teach students but also be a resource for teachers.“In addition to my research I care a lot about teaching,” Lander said. “I think there is a great partnership to be had between universities and high school teachers, and middle school teachers.”This year’s recipients will be a part of the selection committee for future winners. The board plans to award five prizes per year to researchers in the life sciences.Lander said he looks forward to contributing to the selection process.“When they give you the prize you feel pretty positively disposed to helping them, so I think we all said sure,” Lander said.The guidelines for the selection process include that the prize should recognize major achievements, but there are no age restrictions, many people can share it, and it can be received by the same individual more than once.—Staff writer Rachel J.

Just about a calendar year ago, Jeremy Lin ’10 burst onto the NBA scene, jumpstarting Linsanity. Lin, who then won a job as the New York Knicks’ starting point guard, won over the hearts of fans as he led the Knicks to seven consecutive wins. His 136 points through his first five starts were the most in league history.In New York, under head coach Mike D’Antoni, Lin benefited from the absence of Carmelo Anthony. In D’Antoni’s offense, the point guard begins almost every play with a pick-and-roll that gives said point guard full responsibility. The offense is predicated on the use of “finesse” power forwards that can stretch the floor—à la Steve Novak in New York as well as Boris Diaw in Phoenix—and shooters from all angles.Lin is at his best as a slasher attacking the lane, where he is adept at both finishing in traffic and drawing high-percentage free throws. The Harvard alum, who shoots about 80 percent from the line for his career, consistently benefited as a Knick by playing with an exceptional pick-and-roll big man in Tyson Chandler—who shot nearly 70% last year from the center position. He repeatedly ran pick-and-rolls with the option to either hit the rolling Chandler if both defendersconverged or blow by a defender into the lane if his defender went over Chandler’s pick. If his defender went under the pick, Lin had the green light to shoot the three. Although it isn’t his strong suit, Lin shot a respectable 33 percent from deep in the 2011-2012 season. If he drove, Lin would have shooters, including Novak and J.R. Smith, on the edges.In Houston, Lin is part of a rotating cast of ball handlers. James Harden—who averages 5.7 assists—will often be the one to begin the Rockets’ possessions. Harden is a better pick-and-roll player than Lin and an adept finisher at the rim who draws 10 free throws a game, which he converts at an 86 percent clip. Houston likes to use pick and rolls with Harden and big men Omer Asik and Patrick Patterson that allow Harden to drive inside with the screen man collapsing to the hoop, enabling the former to either dish it off or take it to the basket—where he draws contact better than anyone else in the NBA.
When Harden is handling the ball, Lin will often curl along the baseline and set screens for shooters like Chandler Parsons and Carlos Delfino. Frequently happening at the same time as a pick-and-roll at the top of the key, these screens free up those shooters to rotate towards the top of the arc.Another intriguing quirk to the offense is using Lin as a backdoor cutter. If Lin can create separation from his man darting to the post, he usually has the option when he catches the ball either to go up for a lay-up or hit a cutting man in the lane. If the defense collapses, Lin can pass the ball back to a shooter on the wing.When Lin has the ball, he runs sets very similar to the ones D’Antoni drew up for him last year. The Rockets’ league-leading offense is centered around the three (the squad takes about 28 attempts per game) and the free throw (26 tries per game). If Lin gets the ball in transition, he is free to drive up the court and often goes straight to the rim. However, Lin gets less than half—48 percent—of his field goals via assist, one of the lowest rates on the team, evidence of how often he creates his own shot.Since both Lin and Harden are most effective with the ball in their hands, the duo’s minutes are staggered to minimize the amount they share the court. It’s no coincidence that Lin’s most productive output of the year (38 points against San Antonio on Dec. 10) came with Harden sidelined. Lin has been turnover prone for most of his career—he averages three a game—but is maximally effective as the focal point of the offense.At this point in his career, Lin is not nearly the player Harden is and is not the focal point of his team’s offense. At Harvard and New York, Lin brought the ball up the floor consistently. In Houston, he has begun working more on his three-point shot, a weaker element of his game. Although he air-balled a game-winning three-point attempt against Miami earlier this year, he is making progress. The combination of Lin’s developing three-point shot and his improved off-ball skills bodes well for his future in the NBA as he adapts to a new role in Houston.—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

It’s always intense when a Crimson squad pays a visit to New Haven. The rivalry is a particularly central one in squash, as the two schools have combined to win 41 of the 68 national championships in the collegiate history of the sport.Both teams will get a chance to add another as the Harvard men’s squash team (15-2, 6-1 Ivy) travels to the home of its foe to attempt to build on Monday’s triumph.The rivalry recently heated up as the College Squash Association Team Championships come on the heels of an unsuccessful voyage to Cambridge on the part of this year’s hosts. The match, which pitted the Crimson against the Bulldogs (11-3, 5-2), ultimately decided which one-loss squad would go on to share the Ivy League title distinction with Princeton.“We are really confident coming off a win,” co-captain Zeke Scherl said. “I really just think everyone needs to execute their game plans.”With a national championship on the line, the squad will look to stay disciplined.
“Early mileage in this tournament has been tough for us in the past,” Scherl said. “We don’t want anyone expending unnecessary energy.”Having won its last four conference matchups, Harvard will come into the tournament as the third-ranked team in the nation behind Trinity and the Tigers. The latter is currently looking to defend its national championship.The two schools handed the Crimson each of its 5-4 losses thus far this season.Yale will get a chance to avenge itself on its home turf in the Potter Cup, or “A division,” which features the top eight teams in the country in a single elimination bracket.Other schools in contention include Cornell, Franklin and Marshall College, and St. Lawrence University.As the three seed, Harvard will take on sixth-seeded Rochester in the first round.“The first match is crucial,” Scherl said. “We are really focused on getting on and off the court. I think we can beat this team 9-0 if everyone comes out and plays their best squash.”Should it survive the test, the Crimson would likely get a second shot at a defending national champion Princeton squad that it lost to in a heartbreaker on the road earlier this season.“The best thing that could happen [on Friday] is to get another chance to battle it out against Princeton,” Scherl said. “I think the match would definitely have a different feel about it if we were to get through our first match against Rochester.”After the 5-4 loss to the Tigers in mid-January, the team found a way to turn it around, emerging victorious in eight of its subsequent nine matches.

I still remember the day it became clear that Keith Wright ’12 had made the leap.It was Oct. 30, 2010, and it was at Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s annual preseason coaching clinic—the first chance for fans to get a glimpse of the upcoming season’s squad.Almost immediately, it was evident that Wright, then about to enter his junior year, was a different player than he had been the previous season. He had added a short jumper to his arsenal that was reliable and accurate in that first practice, and I knew then that the center was due for a breakout season.The Crimson’s greatest flaw the prior year had been its lack of a true interior threat, forcing Jeremy Lin ’10 to try to do everything on his own despite facing constant double teams. Defensively, when it came to guarding opposing big men like Cornell’s Jeff Foote, Harvard was left with few options, and without anyone to take pressure off Lin inside, the team finished third in the Ivy League.But when Wright raised his game his junior season, everything changed. He was a transformed player, and that transformed the team as a whole. In 2010-11, the Crimson had the ability to play inside-out, something Amaker loves to do, and behind Wright—who won Ivy League Player of the Year—Harvard was finally able to take that next step and win its first-ever league championship.
The 2012-13 Crimson, up until last Friday night, faced a similar problem as its 2009-10 predecessor.The offense had three of the four pieces it needed: a go-to scorer (sophomore Wesley Saunders), dangerous long-distance shooters (co-captains Laurent Rivard and a revitalized Christian Webster), and a distributor to orchestrate everything (freshman Siyani Chambers).But it was missing the final piece of the puzzle—the interior presence. Sophomore Jonah Travis provided solid production, but not the kind you can run your offense through, and his 6’6” stature greatly limited the team’s ability to slow opposing big men at the other end.Facing the two biggest teams in the conference this weekend, Amaker thus decided to give Kenyatta Smith his first real opportunity for redemption since the turnover-prone sophomore lost his starting job after five games.Given a second chance, something clicked for Smith this weekend, and just like Wright two years ago, it was immediately evident that he was a different player. With the emergence of an interior presence, Harvard could play inside-out once again, and everything else fell into place around him offensively.Just like that, gone were the days of struggling against inferior Ivy opponents. Last weekend, there was no need for a dramatic comeback, as against Dartmouth, or to stave off a collapse, as against Yale, Brown, and Cornell. Nor was this the same team that a week earlier had gotten blown out by Columbia, which has only won one of seven games against the rest of the league.No, not only did the Crimson sweep this past weekend, but it also dominated, and that was largely the result of Smith’s emergence.The center shot a superb 13-of-14 from the field over the two nights, but his defensive numbers are even more astounding. According to calculations by the Ivy Basketball Blog, Smith would be leading the country in block rate and rebound percentage if he had played enough minutes to qualify. Over Harvard’s past 17 games, opponents are shooting under 40 percent when Smith is on the court; only Jeff Withey’s Kansas does better in that category.Can Smith maintain those numbers when his minutes increase? Highly unlikely. But last weekend, they were a huge reason why the Crimson won both games while holding its rivals below 60 points—something it did 19 times last season but had previously not done against a Division I opponent this year.Sure, it’s only been two games, but as they did for Wright three years ago, things appear to have clicked at both ends for Smith, who has finally tapped into the vast potential that earned him multiple offers from high-major programs.

At the head of an intimate round table at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman conversed with professors and community members about the transforming cultural politics of the Salafi movement in the wake of the Arab Spring.Feldman highlighted that a deeply unconventional form of Salafism has become a common mode of expression for rebellious middle class youth, who are coupling traditional Salafi customs to unorthodox practices.The new Tunisian Salafis, Feldman noted, wear traditional attire alongside non-traditional clothing. For example, a woman might wear a head scarf with a mini-skirt.“Nobody dressed this way in urban areas of Tunisia [before the Arab Spring],” Feldman said. “It would have been culturally unthinkable.”The cultural aspects of this new Salafism intertwine with political motives. The new Salafis are covering the whole spectrum of political action, from peaceful reactionary protests to violent actions.
“It looks like a youth movement...but there is something even noble about it,” Feldman said.Feldman underscored that between naiveté and religious belief, the Tunisian Salafis are attempting to change the world around them.Sarah C. Plana ’12, a research assistant in the government department who attended the seminar, said Feldman’s discussion captured the complicated nature of the Tunisian Salafi movement and its potential repercussions onto area politics.Feldman elaborated on the potential impact of the Tunisian Salafi movement in the broader Arab world.“[The Salafi movement] jumps across borders incredibly effectively,” Feldman argued, citing the rapid spread of this cultural trend in countries other than Tunisia.Feldman argued that the split between moderate Islamists and the Salafis may become an issue of central significance to the politics of the Arab world in the near future, especially if it were to erupt into violence.“It would not take many Salafis to make a general turn to violence,” Feldman said.—Staff writer Antonio Coppola can be reached acoppola@college.harvard.edu.

Entering in plain blue jeans, a black blazer, and bright red nails, Edward J. “Eddie” Izzard flaunted his observational humor as he accepted the sixth annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism in Memorial Church on Wednesday. Though comedic in tone, Izzard’s acceptance speech—delivered as part of Harvard’s Atheist Coming Out Week— delivered a serious message encouraging audience members to believe in each other instead of an “invisible person.”“Science is full of theories. Religion is just full of stories,” Izzard said. “They’re stories, in which case Lord of the Rings is the same.”Izzard questioned the religious figures present in many faiths, taking issue with the notion of a religious leader who demands human sacrifice and constant praise, but does not make an appearance in times of extreme suffering.“No God has ever turned up. No God has ever, ever turned up,” he said.Izzard poked fun at the lack of this “invisible figure” in the lives of both believers and non-believers.
“Don’t send a bush down...and set it on fire,” Izzard said, referencing religious “stories” which he contrasted to scientific theories.Izzard also made light of recent growth in the number of followers of the Catholic Church.“People say that Catholicism is the fastest growing religion, and that just cannot be. Even the Pope’s getting out,” he said.In his introduction, Harvard’s Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein said that the members of the Humanist community at large believe in a simple truth: “good without God.”Epstein said that this belief and the values of the Humanist community are among many things that have contributed to a society of humanists that has grown “too big for little spaces.” These values include “compassion, creativity, justice, awareness, feminism, science, and progress,” Epstein said.Izzard also discussed the growth of the Humanist community.“Humanist Society, it’s the fastest growing, not religion, thought process...fastest growing sensibility in the world,” he said.Epstein described Izzard as a product of the culture of the growing Humanist community.“Culture is what we create to remind us in every aspect of our lives to love, laugh, cry, feel...connect,” Epstein said.Izzard expressed a similar sentiment about humanism.“I believe in us, I believe in other people,” Izzard said. “I think Heaven and Hell are here on Earth and [are] what we make of it. I’m happy to be proved wrong on this, but until then... I’m going to stand by this.”Throughout the speech, Izzard repeated a short statement that encapsulated the central point of his talk: “It’s just us, guys.”—Staff writer Zohra D.

In the midst of a national debate regarding gun-control policies, National Rifle Association President David A. Keene called on the government to better enforce existing laws regarding firearms before making legislative changes during an event in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics on Wednesday night.“Before you start expanding this system, you need to make it work,” said Keene of existing legislation.Keene spent half of the hour-long discussion deflecting largely critical questions from audience members from across the University. One Harvard undergraduate asked Keene to reflect on the controversial NRA commercial that labeled the president an “elitist hypocrite” for sending his daughters to a school with armed guards. A Harvard Kennedy School student asked if he thought America’s founders would consider the Second Amendment “necessary and constitutional” in modern times.Keene was defensive in his responses, reiterating points that have been made by members of the NRA in the past.Popular semi-automatic firearms should remain legal, Keene said, “because they’re legitimate under the constitution, [people] enjoy them, millions of people use them, very rarely are they used for criminal purposes.”
Many lawmakers have recently sought to renew the ban on assault rifles which expired in 2004. Assault rifles have been the weapon of choice for many of the perpetrators of recent mass shootings.Such weapons were addressed in gun legislation passed by the New York State Assembly and Senate following the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School—policies that Keene said were “rammed through” in the wake of tragedy.“It’s a mistake, for policy reasons, to be making legislation at the height of an emotional moment,” Keene said.Although the mass shooting at Sandy Hook was not central to the discussion, the Progressive Caucus, a student group at the Kennedy School, handed out green ribbon pins to audience members prior to the event. The ribbon, worn by President Barack Obama during his State of the Union Address, commemorates the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.Many across the United States have advocated for universal background checks for those who want to purchase guns. When event moderator, CNN Chief National Correspondent, and IOP Fellow John King brought up the idea, Keene criticized this, calling it burdensome and restricting to law-abiding citizens.While Keene said that the NRA did not want to shut down any conversation, he said that NRA “will not support something which we think burdens the innocent to try to find the very few who are guilty.”Debates over gun regulations taking place nationwide have found their way to Harvard’s campus, where the Undergraduate Council recently released a report examining the University’s gun policies. Harvard’s official rules ban “[p]ossession and/or use on University property of firearms or other dangerous weapons.”During an interview with The Crimson, Keene said that although the University is a private institution that has the right to make its own rules, “from a policy standpoint, the students probably would be safer” if Harvard lifted its ban on guns.“A very strong argument can be made that you’re better off from a security standpoint to allow responsible people to carry arms,” Keene said.—Staff writer Steven R.

Harvard has hired a Title IX Coordinator to oversee the University’s compliance with the 40-year-old gender equality legislation, according to a Harvard spokesperson.The new appointee, whose name will be announced when he or she begins work in March, will monitor Harvard’s policies “to ensure compliance with state and federal law and regulations,” wrote Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal in an emailed statement.According to the statement, the new coordinator will work across the University’s various schools and departments to collect statistics about sexual harassment on campus, disseminate educational material related to sexual assault prevention, and provide annual compliance reports to students and administrators. The appointee will also coordinate efforts to promote equal access for all students in admissions, athletics, and academics.Neal wrote that the position was created last fall and the new coordinator was hired “in recent months.” He declined to comment on why Harvard decided to create the new post.According to the Department of Education’s website, Title IX requires all colleges and universities to maintain a Title IX coordinator and notify all students of the coordinator’s name and contact information.
In recent years, Harvard has faced considerable external pressure to reevaluate its compliance with Title IX.In April 2011, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights sent a “Dear Colleague” letter containing a new set of Title IX guidelines to colleges and universities receiving federal funding. The letter recommended that every school “designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX.”That same month, New England School of Law professor Wendy Murphy filed a Title IX complaint against Harvard Law School, alleging that the school’s sexual assault policies did not comply with the latest guidelines issued by the Office for Civil Rights.The Office for Civil Rights launched an official investigation, but the case has yet to be resolved.Harvard’s move makes Dartmouth the only school in the Ivy League that does not employ an administrator officially designated as a Title IX coordinator.In November 2011, Yale named a campus Title IX coordinator as part of a response into an Office for Civil Rights investigation into its procedures.Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, signed into law by Richard Nixon, forbids discrimination based on sex in “any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”Although the legislation is widely known for increasing the participation of women in high school and collegiate sports, it also treats sexual harassment as a form of discrimination.—Staff writer Michelle Denise L.

UPDATED: February 21, 2013, at 10:46 p.m.Nicole Scherzinger, the former lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls, has been named the Harvard Foundation’s 2013 Artist of the Year.The musician, who now performs as a solo artist, has won two MTV Music Video Awards, as well as three Billboard Music Awards for the Pussycat Dolls’ 2005 hit song “Don’t Cha.”Scherzinger will be honored on Saturday at the 28th annual Cultural Rhythms festival, a day-long campus diversity celebration that will also feature performances and cuisine from student groups.Scherzinger, whose father is of Filipino descent and whose mother is of Russian and Hawaii descent, is the first woman of Asian American heritage to be honored with the award, according to S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation.
“It’s a real honor for us,” Counter said of Scherzinger’s selection.In past years, Scherzinger has been nominated for the award several times by Harvard students, particularly those of Hawaiian and Filipino origin, Counter said.On Saturday, Scherzinger will be roasted at 12 p.m. in Kirkland House, dine with students at a luncheon, and then receive her award at Cultural Rhythms’ 3 p.m. matinée show.In choosing its Artist of the Year, the Harvard Foundation seeks to honor people of diverse backgrounds who have also dedicated time and effort to philanthropy, Counter said.Scherzinger has been active in supporting individuals with Down Syndrome and raising money for breast cancer research.In celebration of its 30th anniversary this year, the Harvard Foundation has also invited United States Treasurer Rosa G. Rios ‘87 to appear at the festival. Rios, who helped found Cultural Rhythms as an undergraduate, will introduce Scherzinger at the matinée show.Student performers from a handful of student organizations across campus, including Harvard Bhangra, Mariachi Veritas de Harvard, the Kuumba Singers, and the Harvard Breakers, will also showcase their talents at the matinée show. More student performances will follow during an evening show later that day.Last year Grammy Award-winning musician <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/26/john-legend-cultural-rhythms/"">John Legend was honored at the festival.

Last weekend saw the Harvard men's basketball team sweep the killer P's, Penn and Princeton, at home at Lavietes Pavilion in one of the most important weekends of their year.The Crimson, now 7-1 in the Ivy League, sits alone at the top of conference standings with just under half the season left to play. Princeton, a game and a half behind, holds an Ancient Eight record of 5-2, having dropped Saturday's game to Harvard a week after their 21-game league win streak at Jadwin Gymnasium was broken by Yale.So what's next in the world of Ivy hoops? Flyby's resident Crimson sports expert is here to give you what you need to know about our team going forward.<!--more-->Harvard will hit the road this weekend hoping to sweep southern New England foes Brown and Yale, while Princeton will try to prevent an upset at Columbia and Cornell.The next weekend will be key to deciding the conference champion. Harvard and Princeton will meet again, this time in New Jersey, in a vital contest on March 1.
Should the Crimson pull off a win in the Tigers' den, a feat they haven't accomplished since Feb. 3, 1989, the Ivy title would be theirs to lose. If Harvard loses, however, Princeton would likely rejoin them atop Ancient Eight. Barring another upset for either team as they close out the regular season, a one-game playoff would be forced to decide which team receives the NCAA berth, and we all know how much Harvard basketball loves <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/3/12/mbk-princeton-recap-031211/"">one-game playoffs.With the recent momentum that has propelled the Crimson to two solid victories and the constant threat that is Ian Hummer and his army of orange and black big men, the next couple of weekends will hold the attention of any Ivy basketball fan.In short, pray that Harvard doesn't drop another game or that Princeton falls to another Ivy opponent, and perhaps the Crimson will get to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/7/mbk-tournament-030612/"">go dancing again this year.

Crowdsourcing, posing a question, problem, or idea on the internet with the hope of soliciting responses from other web-users, has emerged as a valuable new method of soliciting ideas and solutions in the medical field, according to a case study conducted jointly by researchers at Harvard Medical School, Harvard Business School, London Business School, and web-based innovation company TopCoder.“The beauty of crowdsourcing is that it provides access to people that you would never normally meet,” said Ramy A. Arnaout, an assistant professor of pathology at the Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.Arnaout, who co-authored the study, examined the impact of providing cash prizes to software developers and programmers on the web to encourage responses to a computational biological problem.Arnaout said that the study—which was released in the scientific journal Nature Biotechnology on Feb. 7—showed that crowdsourcing is “100 percent beneficial,” calling the solutions from TopCoder users “mind-bogglingly elegant.”Of the 122 responses to Arnaout’s TopCoder post, 16 of the algorithm solutions were more efficient and accurate than the ones produced by Arnaout and 30 beat the well-established National Institute of Health’s MegaBLAST benchmark, according to the study. Associate professor at the Medical School Eva C. Guinan, who also worked on the study, said that while researchers had originally been working with four to five approaches to the problem, the submissions provided 89 new ways to approach the problem.
Although crowdsourcing traditionally only has been employed in more commercial settings, the scope of the study suggests that there is a place for crowdsourcing in scientific and medical fields.“In our pursuit of knowledge we can leverage the knowledge of other people around the world,” said Harvard Business School assistant professor Karim R. Lakhani.Robert Hughes, the president of TopCoder, said he believes that scientists will soon be able to use crowdsourcing to sift through large data sets, utilizing a global community to answer complicated problems.Guinan echoed Hughes, saying that web-based crowdsourcing could prove valuable in academic problem-solving.“I think that in many ways the core message here is that in a complicated world where time and resource are limiting, you need to be aware of the means at your disposal to make progress in the most efficient way you can,” she said.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: Feb. 24, 2013An earlier version of this article misidentified the gender of associate professor at the Medical School Eva C. Guinan, who is in fact a woman.

Biology professor of practice Robert A. Lue was named the first Faculty Director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning Thursday, a sign of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ increased emphasis on innovative teaching, both in person and online.Lue currently serves as director of the life sciences and faculty director of HarvardX—the University’s online education platform launched last spring as part of EdX. A key figure in reshaping aspects of the University’s curricula in the classroom and online in recent years, Lue said he will serve to unite those two areas in his new role at the Bok Center.“I really do feel that we’re at a particularly exciting moment in terms of both faculty and students being ready to embrace new ways of teaching, and I really want the Bok Center to be a catalyst where undergraduates, graduate students, and professors can come together to push the envelope of how teaching is done at Harvard,” Lue said in an interview Thursday.The Bok Center traditionally focuses on hands-on instruction and academic research to help young faculty and teaching fellows become better teachers.Lue said he hopes that by coupling the educational tools provided by HarvardX with the Bok Center’s personal instruction, the center can more actively set the pedagogical agenda for 21st century faculty and students.
Administrators praised Lue as an innovator on Thursday, saying that under his leadership, they expect the Bok Center to take on increased importance for faculty members.“We are very excited to have Rob’s vision, energy, and leadership at the Bok Center,” said Terry Aladjem, executive director of the Bok Center. “He has been an inspired innovator in science education, and in shepherding HarvardX, and he will certainly give the Bok Center and its mission new and greater prominence within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.”Lue’s appointment is part of a broader administrative shift by the University to further develop HarvardX. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced in January that Colorado State University’s Huntington D. Lambert, a major figure in online education, will <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/25/huntington-lambert-dean-education/"">take over as head of the Division of Continuing Education in April. Lambert is the founder of CSU’s Global Campus, the first state-funded university to be entirely online, and is expected to develop the division’s presence online.Lue also serves as director of the Harvard Allston Education Portal. He was previously the Dean of Harvard Summer School. He will begin his new role on March 1.—Staff writer Nicholas P. Fandos can be reached at nicholasfandos@college.harvard.edu.

Presumably, this is how the discussion in the Harvard men’s basketball locker room went prior to the team’s game last Friday against Penn:Crimson Coach Tommy Amaker: “…and, you know, we’re going to need our big guys to step up. Jonah has been doing it all season. Steve, we’re going to need a little more consistency out of you. And Kenyatta, I mean…you were a three-star recruit, top twenty in the country at your position, so it’s time—“Sophomore Kenyatta Smith: “I WAS WHAT?” [sprints to court, blocks ten shots]I wonder what the Thursday night odds were on Smith winning Ivy Player of the Week. He certainly earned the award, racking up 34 points on 93 percent shooting, 16 rebounds, and 16 blocks in the weekend’s two games, including a near-triple-double on Friday. Those are comical numbers for a guy who came into the matchup against Penn averaging 3.8 points and 3.2 rebounds per game, but the Crimson wouldn’t have swept the Killer P’s without him.Perhaps more encouraging than the gaudy stats he put up on the Quakers was his play the next night against Princeton, in which he filled Harvard’s biggest hole—an intimidating interior defensive presence to complement sophomores Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi. If Smith can submit something that approaches that performance on a consistent basis, Harvard’s slim lead atop the Ivy standings starts to look quite a bit more formidable.
HARVARD at BROWNThe Crimson opens its weekend with a light jaunt to Providence to take on the Bears and freshman forward Cedric Kuakumensah, coming off an Ivy Rookie of the Week performance. Kuakumensah was particularly impressive in defeat against Cornell on Saturday, overwhelming the Big Red with a string of seemingly unrelated consonants and vowels on his way to 13 points, 19 rebounds, and four blocks. He may cause one or two problems for Harvard down low, but the Crimson front line is playing with confidence. It won’t take double overtime to put away Brown.Pick: HarvardDARTMOUTH at YALEThe Bulldogs will gear up for their rivalry showdown the next night with a home date against the Big Green. Expect Yale to enter the weekend with confidence, fresh off a 19-point dismantling of Columbia in which the Bulldogs shot 62 percent from the field. Expect Dartmouth to play substandard basketball.Pick: YalePRINCETON at COLUMBIAEmbarking on another of its season-ending road journeys—the Tigers will have played seven of their last nine away from Jadwin Gymnasium by the end of the year—Princeton makes the quick northeastern jump to New York to take on last-place Columbia. The Lions’ only real chance lies with Steve Frankoski and his startling 48.7 percent three-point shooting; if he gets as hot as he did against the Crimson (5-for-7 from beyond the arc), things could get interesting.Pick: PrincetonPENN at CORNELL

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team commences its season with a matchup against No. 7/5 Massachusetts (2-0) this Saturday at 1 p.m. at Harvard Stadium. After completing the 2012 season with a 6-8 record, the Crimson looks to begin 2013 with a home victory.“I think our strength coming in right now is our attitude,” captain Jason Gonos said. “We have been working hard this off-season to address a lot of the weaknesses we’ve had in the past…we had a lot to improve all over the field. Even addressing all those things, I think the main thing we’ve improved is our attitude, our confidence. We work hard every day, we come every day to set the bar higher.”Although Harvard is just beginning its regular season, the Minutemen are coming off of a 12-11 upset of No. 7/4 North Carolina this past weekend. UMass’s first win came in its season opener against Army, in which it toppled the Black Knights, 16-9.“[UMass is] a great team,” Gonos said. “They’re a physical team, and they work hard in between the lines. Whatever they do, they do it really well. They’ve proven that they deserve to be highly ranked in their first two games.”Last season, the Minutemen finished 15-1, with its first and only loss coming in the first round of the NCAA tournament against Colgate. UMass has historically dominated the Crimson, with an overall record of 30-13.
“They really took it to us [last season],” junior attackman Danny Eipp said. “It was one of the more embarrassing games for us, especially with them being one of our biggest rivals, so Coach made this our first game on purpose…I think we’re going to match their intensity.”Gonos leads Harvard on defense after a season filled with career-high numbers. The senior picked up 33 groundballs and forced 14 turnovers during the 2012 season. The NCAA chose Gonos as a candidate for the 2013 Senior CLASS Award, an honor given to only 19 other college lacrosse players.“[Gonos is] the best leader I’ve ever had and faced in my sports career,” Eipp said. “He really sets the tone…to be completely honest with you, I’ve never been on a team I feel more confident in. Our mindset this year is really positive, and no one cares who does well as long as the team succeeds.”The New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association selected three players from each of the competing squads for preseason All-NEILA honors. Harvard’s selections included Eipp, senior midfielder Alex White, and freshman attackman Devin Dwyer. Eipp has made an appearance on the All-Ivy team twice during his three years, as well as ending last year with 42 points, the team’s second-highest total.As a midfielder, White was a key component on the Crimson offense, notching five goals and collecting 19 groundballs in his junior campaign.Harvard must deal with the loss of two high-scoring graduates, attackman Jeff Cohen and midfielder Kevin Vaughn. Cohen tallied a team-high 48 goals in 2012, while Vaughn led the squad with 19 assists.“Last season we had a lot of great players, so it’s really hard to see your top scorers leave and graduate, but this year so many guys have stepped up in all different positions and all different ways,” Gonos said. “We’ve really kind of come together as a team, playing great team offense, great team defense, and really supporting each other all over the field.”Along with Eipp, three other upperclassmen look to repeat successful seasons on offense. Seniors Jack Walker and Ryan Stevens put up seven and five goals respectively for the Crimson, while junior Carl Zimmerman posted five goals and six assists this past spring.The freshmen bring new talent to the team, with Dwyer and Bobby Duvnjak ranking as Inside Lacrosse’s No. 4 attackman and No. 2 defenseman recruits, respectively. NEILA also named Dwyer the preseason Rookie of the Year.The Crimson men’s lacrosse schedule features two nationally-televised games, with contests against No. 13/14 Duke on NBC Sports Network on March 30 and against No. 14/13 Princeton on ESPNU on April 19.“We’ve yet to play a game this year,” Gonos said. “We’ve been so excited for this game—we’ve really been looking forward to it—so I think it’ll be all about settling down, managing our emotions, and making sure we execute.”—Staff writer Kelley Guinn McArtor can be reached at kelleyguinnmcartor@college.harvard.edu.

The Ivy League championship is now the Harvard men’s basketball team’s to lose.The Crimson took a 1.5-game lead over Princeton in the Ancient Eight standings last weekend, downing Penn and the Tigers in back-to-back games for just the second time in four years.With six Ivy contests remaining, Harvard just needs to hang on to secure its third straight title and punch a ticket to the NCAA tournament.But if the past is any indication, doing so won’t be easy.The Crimson’s first two challenges will come this weekend, when Harvard (15-7, 7-1 Ivy) heads to Providence and New Haven to take on sixth-place Brown (9-13, 3-5) and fourth-place Yale (10-14, 3-5).
The Crimson defeated both teams at Lavietes Pavilion earlier this season—but not without a struggle.Against the Bulldogs, Harvard played much of the second half without starting point guard Siyani Chambers, who was on the bench with four fouls, and saw its 13-point lead cut to three. The Crimson hung on for a 67-64 victory but was just one possession away from playing its second straight overtime game.Harvard got its fair share of extra time the next night, though, as Brown made the Crimson play two extra sessions. Harvard led, 63-41, with 12:58 remaining, but the Bears closed out regulation on a 28-6 run to force overtime. An additional five minutes wasn’t enough to settle the contest, but co-captain Christian Webster posted five points in the second overtime to help deliver Harvard an 89-82 win and preserve the Crimson’s undefeated conference record.“We know that they’re going to have a lot of confidence against us just the way those two games ended,” Webster said.But Harvard may have a new weapon at its disposal for its rematches with Brown and Yale.After being a relative non-factor through the Crimson’s first 20 games, sophomore center Kenyatta Smith exploded this past weekend, racking up 34 points, 16 rebounds, and 16 blocks in Harvard’s victories. When Smith last matched up against the Bears and Bulldogs, he recorded eight total points, seven rebounds, and two blocks.The performance earned Smith his first-ever Ivy League Player of the Week award.“Obviously what he did this past weekend was nothing short of amazing,” Amaker said. “We’re hopeful that we can continue to ride the wave or the momentum of his performance.”If Smith were to turn in a similar performance this coming weekend at Yale and Brown—the Ivy League’s top offensive rebounding teams—the Crimson would likely emerge with two victories.But the Crimson may not be able to count on a repeat performance. Smith missed Wednesday’s practice due to illness, but he is expected to be back in time for this weekend’s contests.

This is the fourth instalment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues.If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic ""Are there serious deficiencies with Harvard's mental health services?"" please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday, Feb. 27 at 6 pm . Democracy, the Ugly Kid 
Let me be clear: I am emphatically opposed to the Boy Scouts of America’s policy of excluding openly gay individuals from its membership. Yes, the policy further isoaltesadolescents questioning their sexualities. Yes, it is considered by many to be “backwards” in a progressive age. Yes, such a policy contradicts the Scouts’ own oath to “help other people at all times.”Nevertheless, I even more emphatically support BSA’s right to hold such views. Boy Scouts of America is a private, non-governmental organization supported entirely by donations. As such, the Supreme Court has held in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale that their freedom of association allows them to exclude members that hinder the group’s ability to “advocate public or private viewpoints.” Where opponents of the Dale decision err, though, is their assumption that the freedom of association is a blanket protection of the organization from individual or group efforts to change these values. Wrong. Freedom of association protects BSA only from a government intervention. Actions such as Eagle Scouts <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/28/us/boy-scouts-policy/"">renouncing their medals or legislation banning the organization’s <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323764804578314623259301706.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"">tax exemption are still rightfully allowed.Freedom of association, a derivative of the freedom of speech, states that “Congress shall make no law” infringing on individual or collective rights. Let’s imagine that Congress disbanded any organization that expelled or banned members on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. How many churches, country clubs, cultural groups, fraternities, sororities, and political parties must the government then dismantle to prove its point, and with what consequences for the civic life of our country? The right to band together around a set of views—savory or unsavory, radical or conservative—is the fundamental cornerstone of democracy that we must consciously guard against trampling, as progressive as our intent may be.Democracy is not the homecoming queen; it’s the ugly kid in the back of the room that we still include at recess. Democracy is tough and ugly in a country as large and diverse as ours. At times, it is easy to dismiss others’ viewpoints as “incorrect” or “un-American,” but we must always, as Franklin stated, “defend to the death” their right to hold those views, because like it or not, they are equally sovereign parts in this centuries-long project of self-rule.Lisa Wang ’14 is a government concentrator in Pforzheimer House.  The Boy Scouts of America and the Limits of Free SpeechWhen the Supreme Court decided Boy Scouts of America v. Dale in 2000, it did so by the thinnest possible margin—a 5/4 split. At issue in the case was whether a New Jersey ordinance mandating nondiscrimination in places of public accommodation unconstitutionally infringed upon the Scout’s freedom of speech. The controversial ruling ultimately upheld the Scout’s discriminatory ban on gay members, deeming it a form of expressive association protected under the First Amendment.From the day it was decided, Dale stood out like a sore thumb against the remainder of the Court’s free speech jurisprudence. As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent, it marked the first time in the Court’s entire history that “a claimed right to associate in the selection of members prevailed in the face of a State’s antidiscrimination law.”

The Cambridge Police Department this week became among the first departments in the country to use Twitter to report potential crimes in nearly real time.Since launching the new initiative earlier this week, the department has begun using its Twitter account, <a href=""https://twitter.com/CambridgePolice"">@CambridgePolice, to alert its nearly 3,900 followers of possible criminal activity, disturbances, and neighborhood incidents—all in 140 characters or fewer. The tweets, which are sent out by an automated system using descriptions filed from 911 calls, have been appearing just minutes after the completion of a 911 call.At 7:25 p.m. on Tuesday night, Twitter-savvy Cambridge residents could have read of a potential assault on <a href=""https://twitter.com/CambridgePolice/status/304023817280430080"">Broadway Street. And early Wednesday evening, residents of Chilton Street who followed CPD on Twitter could have seen a tweet about a possible missing person in their <a href=""https://twitter.com/CambridgePolice/status/304369847243001856\"">area.The new tweets each begin with a timestamp followed by a summary of the reported incident and the hashtag #CambMA.Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas said in a press release that the new initiative was part of the department’s strategy to use social media to engage with Cantabrigians.
“This is something we’ve had in the works for a while,” Haas said. “Tweeting information about serious incidents will better inform our residents about what types of incidents police are responding to in their community.”CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello also stressed that timely communication was a top priority of the project.“It’s a way to share information in real time, so people know what’s going on with their community,” he said.According to Riviello, the new program does not entail a change of procedure for the department or its officers. The text of the tweets is generated from the brief reports that emergency operators file after every 911 call and that are used to dispatch officers. From there, a new application designed by CPD and the Cambridge Emergency Communications Department sorts through the reports and, after a short delay, shares incidents that meet CPD’s criteria via Twitter. These include most reports related to serious crime, with the exception of murder and rape.Riviello said he believes CPD is only the second police department to broadcast reported incidents almost after they happen. Last year, the Seattle Police Department pioneered the new strategy by launching 51 hyper-local accounts on Twitter to report potential crime in city neighborhoods.Riviello said that the public’s response to CPD’s new initiative “seems actually to be pretty positive.”But in the Twitterverse, reviews have been mixed. While some Twitter users praised the strategy, writing that they appreciated CPD’s efforts to keep them informed, others were more skeptical of the new crime updates. One common criticism voiced on Twitter was that CPD’s automated system does not automatically update followers on the outcome of the initial reports it disseminates.For example, on Wednesday afternoon, the department <a href=""https://twitter.com/CambridgePolice/status/304338391821070336"">tweeted “report of possible person with gun on JFK [S]treet in #CambMA.” When no immediate updates were posted, multiple users complained about the lack of follow-up tweets. Thirty-three minutes later, CPD <a href=""https://twitter.com/CambridgePolice/status/304346791862755330"">tweeted that the gun report had been unfounded.Following the incident, Cambridge resident and Twitter user Jeremy Rothman-Shore questioned the prudence of CPD’s new strategy. He wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening: “Messages like that make people feel unreasonably unsafe in their own <a href=""https://twitter.com/jrothmanshore/status/304355489532231681"">city...Every city has reports of people with guns. But [C]ambridge is now shouting it from the rooftops. It doesn’t make us <a href=""https://twitter.com/jrothmanshore/status/304355690149974016"">safer.”—Staff writer Matthew Q. Clarida can be reached at clarida@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter at <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/MattClarida"">@MattClarida.CORRECTION: February 23, 2013An earlier version of this article misquoted a tweet written by Cambridge resident Jeremy Rothman-Shore. In fact, Rothman-Shore wrote on Twitter that he believes that some disseminated information about crime, such as a tweet about a report of a person with a gun circulated by the Cambridge Police Department, makes citizens feel ""unreasonably unsafe,"" not ""unreasonably safe.""

It was very late last Saturday night, in fact around three or four o’clock Sunday morning, when four or five men put their muscle to dislodging the bronze bust of James Russell Lowell from its pedestal in the Lowell House courtyard. What they thought they were doing is beyond my imagining. The bust is heavy, weighing perhaps 500 pounds. It could not have been easy to pry it up from its base. Indeed, the groove at the top of the pedestal seems to have been made by a crowbar, hammered into the base. The bolts that held the piece in place were four or five inches long and came out of the base with the bronze bust when it was toppled to the ground. At that point at least four strong men must have dragged the bust behind the yew trees to a huge garbage can with wheels into which they perhaps thought they could slide the bust, then tip it up and wheel it away. . .somewhere. Alas, this was probably beyond their strength, or perhaps it dawned on them that there was nowhere to go wheeling a huge and heavy trashcan. Or perhaps they had a sighting of the Securitas officer. In any case, James Russell Lowell lay with his head in an overturned trashcan as the snow fell that night.James Russell Lowell, Class of 1838, was born at Elmwood, the Lowell family estate in Cambridge, now the residence of the president of Harvard University. He was a poet, an abolitionist, and ambassador to Spain and later to the Court of St. James. The artist Daniel Chester French (1850-1931) grew up in Concord and briefly attended MIT before undertaking an apprenticeship as a sculptor. His first work was in his native Concord when, at the age of 24, he cast the bronze image of the Minuteman that stands on Concord Green. At Harvard, his best-known work is the statue of John Harvard (1884), and nationwide it is the marble statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. (1920). The bronze bust of Lowell was commissioned by the Harvard Class of 1883 to be placed in Massachusetts Hall. It was moved to Lowell House soon after the House was built in 1930.Being a House Master at Harvard is a many-sided job, which is why I consider it a joy. On a week like this one, it involves not only teaching a full load of classes, but also pouring a hundred cups of tea on Thursday, attending a Master’s Dinner with government professor Beth A. Simmons, listening to two five-minute Lowell House speeches each night, delivered by our students in the Dining Hall, interviewing talented graduate students applying to be resident tutors, encouraging our Dining Hall staff when the Lowerator breaks yet again and they have to scrape and stack all the dirty dishes, and hosting a cocktail party for the support of the Lowell House Opera.Being a House Master also includes taking responsibility as a curator for the portraits, sculptures, and furnishings of the House, most of which are the property of the Harvard Art Museums. Last summer, I spent a month creating a booklet, “Hanging Around Lowell House,” documenting and describing for students and visitors the portraits of the men and women, mostly men, who live with us in the Dining Hall, the Common Rooms, the Courtyard, and the Masters’ Residence. Of course, there were a lot of Lowells, and none more beloved in 19th century Harvard than James Russell Lowell. It was not a joy to find him snow-covered in a trashcan on Sunday.It took five men from the University Art Museums to lift the bronze bust, to slide it onto a sled to be wrapped, secured, and wheeled away. The Fogg staff present assured us that this could not possibly have been an attempted art theft, calculated to get a Daniel Chester French bronze into the market. It was surely, as we all might have imagined, a misguided, alcohol-soaked caper linked, perhaps, to inter-house rivalry or to the theft that same night of the Lowell House banner that has hung in the Dining Hall each night for the past month as a backdrop to the podium where our students deliver their speeches.
It is my hope that those who toppled this bronze bust will come forward to amend this act and offer compensation to have the bust restored to its place. I hope they do so for their sake and for the good of a community in which theft and vandalism have no place in community spirit. But whatever happens, I hope this act will have a sobering effect on those involved when they think about what they have done. And I am quite certain that when they take their families to pose at the John Harvard statue or take their children to the Lincoln Memorial, they will remember this late-night incident with deep regret.Diana L. Eck is Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies and co-House Master of Lowell House.

We have all seen it. That person checking their email in lecture. Or creeping Facebook in section. Or trawling the Web for good deals during seminar. Now, some professors are taking notice, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may follow suit.Last week, The Crimson <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/14/laptops-classroom-internet-ban/"">reported on the status of laptop use at the College. Right now, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has no computer policy, allowing instructors to set their own rules about electronic devices. Yet this could soon change, as the issue of students using the internet during lecture has become a staple of faculty gatherings. Already, faculty members across the departments are placing bans on laptop use, deciding that “at the moment…arguments in favor of disallowing [laptops] outweigh” the positives.Professors should be fed up, and we agree that something has to be done. A few instructors have forbidden laptops entirely. We think that is a non-starter, and we find such an approach paternalistic and impractical. Our generation never learned shorthand, and today’s Harvard students take notes on computers or tablets. Mandating that everyone hand-write lecture notes would be problematic, especially for people who write down their instructor’s every word. Further, it would arbitrarily disadvantage those whose handwriting is on the slower end of the spectrum.Yet there are other ways to minimize distraction in class. One possibility, mentioned by some faculty, is to turn off internet access during lecture. This would give electronic note-takers all the leeway they need, while eliminating the specter of online distraction.On the other hand, seminars and humanities-based sections are a different matter. Instructors and teaching fellows should have a right to restrict the use of laptops in these classes. Here, students are not meant to be stenographers, but rather active participants in discussion. Dialogue and repartee require an intimate learning environment, an aim hindered by the presence of electronic devices. We realize that many courses assign hundreds of pages of reading material per week and that some readings will have to be accessed electronically to save money and paper. For this reason, some seminars and sections allow Kindles or iPads, while others permit laptops, guarding against Facebook and Gmail through spot checks.
We lament the delinquent behavior that laptops enable, and this situation must be remedied. However, an engaged classroom is not irreconcilable with computers and other electronics, which are valuable educational tools that enhance the educational experience of many students. We must not let this make Luddites of us all.

After earning first-team All-Ivy accolades with the Crimson, Birk was a sixth-round draft choice of the Minnesota Vikings in 1998. He was a two-time All-Pro with Minnesota before moving on the Ravens, with whom he won his first career Super Bowl earlier this month.""Matt will down in NFL history as one of the best players, classiest guys and great human beings,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy wrote in an e-mail. “He is a an outstanding ambassador for the NFL and Harvard.”The 2011 NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year, Birk had strongly considered retiring after last season but instead decided to return to Baltimore. The 36-year-old had two years and $8 million left on his contract when he decided to hang up the cleats.“Ultimately I followed my heart,” Birk said. “I just kind of waited a couple weeks for it to settle and kept coming back to this being the right decision for me and my family.”His former coach said he was not surprised by the decision.“Matt informed me of his impending retirement at the beginning of [December],” Murphy wrote. “Me and my son Conor flew down to see his last home game against the Giants as his guest[s].”After the announcement, a number of Birk’s teammates paid their respects to the center on Twitter.“Matt Birk was one of the greatest people I've ever played with...truly a great role model and parent...very fortunate to be his teammate,” wrote wide receiver Torrey Smith.“I have been blessed with the people that I have been able to learn from. Matt Birk was one of the best. It was my honor truly,” added linebacker Jameel McClain.When told his teammates’ comments, Birk reportedly got emotional.“It just stops you in your tracks,” he said. “You play the game for a lot of reasons. But the respect of your opponent, and more so the respect of your teammates, is probably the biggest thing you shoot for.”The Ravens wanted to have a press conference for the center, but he declined. Instead, he chose to make the announcement at the elementary school where his HIKE Foundation will be opening a “Larry Bryant Reading Oasis,” in honor of a special-needs fifth-grader with whom Birk became close.After going out a champion, Birk said he did not have any definitive plans for what he is going to do next.“I certainly didn’t plan on playing football for 15 years,” he said. “Not having a plan has worked out for me so far, so I’m going to stick with it. To cap it with a Super Bowl win, that's a great thing.”—Staff writer Scott A. Sherman can be reached at ssherman13@college.harvard.edu.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—For a majority of the first half, it wasn’t a question of who had more points, Harvard or Brown, but whether the Bears had more points or turnovers.It was the latter, but a Brown run midway through the second period enabled the Bears (10-14, 4-6 Ivy) to close the lead to single-digits for the first time since the score was 11-2 less than six minutes into the contest. Though the Crimson (17-7, 9-1) would win the game, 65-47, Friday night at the Pizzitola Sports Center, its sizable advantage had to be regained in the last fourth of the contest.After 3:43 of radio silence from his squad’s offense to begin the second period followed by an and-one from teammate freshman Cedric Kuakumensah, junior co-captain Sean McGonagill fueled a 12-3 Brown run by hitting back-to-back shots—a jumper and a spinning layup.Harvard’s only response in the next 5:07 was a free throw by sophomore Wesley Saunders and a layup from classmate Kenyatta Smith. The Bears, on the other hand, followed McGonagill’s baskets with a baby-runner thrown up by co-captain Matt Sullivan, a steal and a resulting layup, once again from Sullivan, and one more McGonagill jumper from the right wing.What was once a battle between Brown and itself, was now one between the two schools. With just over 10 minutes remaining in the game, the Crimson’s lead was down to six, and its strongest defensive presence, Smith, was sidelined with four fouls.
“They’re a really resilient team,” Saunders said. “So they don’t get fazed when they get down by any margin, as we’ve seen before. That’s been a trend our whole season, letting teams back into the game, but you have to give credit to them for [continuing to] fight.”But, in the next five minutes, Harvard was able to regain its substantial lead by doubling the Bears’ offensive output during that stretch. Thanks to free throws and layups from sophomore Steve Mondou-Missi and Saunders, the Crimson found breathing room again with 4:53 remaining and a 51-39 advantage. Harvard could coast the rest of the game, and did so, stretching its lead to the final margin of 18.“We were outclassed by a better team tonight” Brown coach Mike Martin said. “Are they a better team than us? Absolutely. Should we compete better than we did tonight? Absolutely. It’s unacceptable. Right now those guys are the standard in our league.... They showed that tonight.”The opening segment of the game seemed to emphasize Martin’s point as the Bears had already accumulated 10 turnovers by the time it knocked in its fifth point at the 7:58 mark. The home squad would go on to make four more mistakes before intermission and, accordingly, went into the locker room with a 29-18 deficit.Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, when asked whether the turnovers were results of Harvard’s defensive pressure or Brown miscues, stated that it was both.“I thought we defended fairly hard, fairly well in the first half in particular,” Amaker said. “We were able to get a few turnovers and run-outs that enabled us to have that wide margin that we had, but I’m sure [Martin] would probably say there were some errors on their part, some lack of execution…I think [it was] combination of the two.”The Crimson began the first period on a 21-5 run, instigated at the outset by Smith, the unexpected star of last weekend’s play. Smith opened the night with two baby hooks and a blocked shot before leaving the game in foul trouble.“I thought the way we started the game was critical,” Amaker said. “We got out to a pretty sizable margin that allowed us to have…a comfortable cushion.”As the contest approached halftime, the Bears would test that cushion, continually forcing their way to the charity stripe. In the final eight minutes before intermission, Brown went to the line 10 times, decreasing its deficit to only 11.While Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers led Harvard’s offense on the night with 19 and 14 points, respectively, it was their defense on McGonagill and Sullivan that drew praise from Amaker. Saunders drew the assignment of Sullivan, the Bears’ leading scorer, and held the senior to just four points on 28.6 percent shooting. Chambers, meanwhile, kept McGonagill to 10 points and forced him to cough up the ball six times.“We’re pleased with the defensive effort without a doubt” Amaker said. “We’re talking about trying to improve, we’re trying to keep the focus…. This time of year if you can still find ways to improve, that’s a huge sign, a very positive sign for this ball club.”—Staff writer Juliet Spies-Gans can be reached at jspiesgans@college.harvard.edu.

This weekend marks the first of back-to-back road stints for the Crimson. First on deck this week is a Friday night game against Brown. Then, Harvard will travel to New Haven to take on the Bulldogs in a Saturday showdown. The Crimson’s basketball beat writers answer five questions about this weekend’s matchups.
1) How does Harvard keep the momentum going from last weekend's wins?
JSG: One of the biggest keys for the Crimson on this road trip will be treating these games as it did its last contest—that is, viewing Brown and Yale as just as big of threats as Princeton. While we all know that neither the Bears nor the Bulldogs have the same level of the talent that the Tigers do, having a let-down game after a big win is all too common in sports. If Harvard wants to keep the momentum rolling from last week, it must throw some early knock-out punches—it must come out with energy and passion in the first halves of the respective games, and not rely on the previous success it has had coming back from large deficits against lesser teams. It is all about energy for the Crimson—whether it be that of sophomore Kenyatta Smith on the defensive end or that of freshman Siyani Chambers on the offensive side of things—they must show early on that they care and that they take this weekend’s match-ups seriously.
<a name=""jump"">
2) Is Harvard's stingy interior defense sustainable for this weekend's games?
DF: After sophomore center Kenyatta Smith’s emergence on the defensive end last weekend, the Crimson has a defensive anchor to pair will its four quick perimeter defenders. Smith and sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi protected the paint well against Penn and Princeton and should have no problem continuing the same this weekend against Brown and Yale. Brown’s top two scorers—Sean McGonagill and Matt Sullivan—are both guards who play more from the perimeter (a combined 273 three-point attempts on the year). Similarly, the Bulldogs are led primarily by guards Austin Morgan and Javier Duran—who combined for 18.5 of the team’s 66 points a game. Moundou-Missi and Smith excel when allowed to roam the paint and help on smaller guards; their struggles come when faced with elite back-to-the-basket talent. With two guard-heavy teams on the schedule this weekend, the Crimson will continue to protect the paint.
3) Who should get the most minutes this weekend: Steve, Jonah, or Kenyatta?
CEC: After this past weekend’s performance, you have to go with Kenyatta Smith.
Despite starting his first game since Nov. 27, the sophomore made his presence felt against Penn, shattering Harvard’s all-time single-game blocks record with 10 against the Quakers. Not to mention he had 20 points and nine rebounds—just one board shy of a triple-double. One night later, against the Crimson’s toughest in-conference competition, Smith had 14 points, seven rebounds, and six blocks—two of which came on shots by Ian Hummer, who is arguably the top forward in the conference. The effort skyrocketed Smith into second place in the Ivy League in blocks per game, while simultaneously helping the Crimson to a 1.5-game lead in the conference standings.
In my opinion, Smith has earned a spot in the starting lineup—at least against Brown. That said, Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi could also see considerable minutes this weekend, and if past games are any indication, at least one of them will. Although his performance was overshadowed by that of his classmate, Moundou-Missi scored in double-digits in both contests last weekend, with 11 and 14 points against the Quakers and the Tigers, respectively. He averages 7.0 ppg and 4.9 rpg, while Travis has contributed 7.6 and 3.5 so far this year. You haven’t seen the last of either of these two guys.
4) What can Harvard do this weekend to avoid a repeat of its last close call against Brown (a double OT win)?
ARM: Simply put, the Crimson just needs to keep its composure. In terms of talent, Harvard is leagues above the Bears and should win this matchup nine out of ten times. But as we saw the last time these two teams met, crazy things can happen in that other ten percent. Coach Amaker spoke last week about his team’s penchant for making things interesting at the end of games, and he mentioned that his team was still very raw. The Crimson regularly starts two sophomores and a freshman and depends on production from two more sophomores off the bench. Still, there’s a reason those players get so much playing time—they’re the reason Harvard sits atop the Ivy standings. If they have used those close calls from earlier in the year as learning experiences, the Crimson should skate by Brown easily. The team’s raw ability will make sure of that.
5) Last time Harvard visited Yale, it was a 20-point blowout. Can Harvard dish out another big win this weekend against the Bulldogs?
HS: After nearly blowing it against Yale at Lavietes earlier this season, the Crimson has the capacity to put the close win in the past and come up with a big victory when it travels to New Haven on Saturday. Last time Harvard was at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, junior guard Laurent Rivard led the team with 18 points, but this year Harvard was plagued with foul trouble as freshman point guard Siyani Chambers was forced to sit out for half of the second period, allowing Yale to mount a near comeback in the first meeting between the two teams. If the Crimson plays clean basketball, there’s no reason that the team should not roll over the Bulldogs. Last time out, Yale had only one scorer—Armani Cotton—in double digits with 15 points, but since then Cotton has slowed down, putting up a combined 15 points in his last three games. If Harvard shows even a fraction of the interior defense it displayed this weekend, it should be able to shut down a Yale offense with no true sparkplug, even with the return of leading scorer Austin Morgan, who sat last time out and is averaging only 11.3 points per game.

Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira introduced new initiatives to help undergraduates cope with mental health issues during a Committee on Student Life meeting Thursday.To strengthen UHS’s efforts in confronting mental health challenges, Barreira said that the University has begun to hire a number of full-time psychiatrists who will focus their attention exclusively on students’ mental well-being.“The college age group is when many of the most common psychiatric problems first commonly present themselves,” Barreira told The Crimson in an interview.HUHS has been criticized in the past for its mental health services, with students complaining about the lack of personalized attention for patients and the perceived specter of being pressured to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/12/mental-health-time-off/"">take time off from school for mental health concerns.According to Barreira, the hiring of more psychiatrists will not only strengthen the University’s ability to deal with mental health cases, but also help tackle some of the underlying pressures that students may face.
Being away from home for the first time, managing the college workload, and dealing with uncertainty about the future are all factors that contribute to student stress, Barreira said.Barreira said he thinks getting students to open up about their well-being may be the biggest challenge. Although it is becoming increasingly more acceptable to talk about depression and other mental illnesses, there is still a “stigma around admitting failure,” Barreira said.“Rather than coming in open-eyed and inquisitive, [students] shut down,” Barriera said.To help address the problem, UHS plans to release a series of videos similar to those in the “It Gets Better” video campaign—a nationwide project that releases videos encouraging LGBTQ youths to believe in their potential for happiness as adults“It’s always good to hear that people are actively involved,” said Tijana Katushevska '16, a member of the Undergraduate Council’s Committee on Student Life. “Everything [Barreira] suggested seemed helpful.”At the meeting, Barreira also introduced a number of student-initiated programs relating to both mental and physical health, including the creation of a peer education group related to general health scheduled to debut in the fall 2013, and Crimson EMS—a student run ambulance service that already has about 30 trained students.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ‘14 urged UC representatives to attend a student-organized rally demanding that the administration take action on mental health in an email sent over the Council’s mailing list early Friday morning.“As advocates for students, we need to be there to express our support for our peers,” she wrote. “This is an incredibly important moment for our community.”The rally is scheduled to take place just one day after an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/anonymous-schizophrenia-help/"">anonymous Crimson op-ed written by a Harvard undergraduate with schizophrenia sparked conversations about mental health across campus and attracted attention on social media websites. According to the email and various online postings, the demonstration is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. Friday outside of Massachusetts Hall—home to the offices of senior Harvard officials including University President Drew G. Faust.The organizers of the event are unknown, but a commenter on The Crimson’s website appears to have nudged the call to action.“Enough is enough, how many <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/17/harvard-many-feel-out/"">‘I Am Fine’s, anonymous op-eds, mental health exposes, and suicides is it going to take before we, the students, demand action?” the commenter asked. “Why isn’t the UC holding demonstrations outside Mass Hall? Why aren’t we all?”
“Let’s demand that the admin address students’ mental health needs. Spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, house email lists. We can demand change,” the comment continued.An apparently different commenter responded on the discussion forum urging students to rally support.“[W]e’ve asked politely, for years, in our panels, discussions, op-eds, spoken word performances, student advocacy groups, and nothing has happened. It’s time to ask in person,” the post read.In addition to the rally, some UC representatives planned to meet with University Health Services spokesperson Lindsey Baker Friday morning to discuss the op-ed and mental health resources at Harvard, according to emails sent over the UC mailing list.—Staff writer Quinn D.

UPDATED: February 23, 2013, at 2:34 p.m.Chanting the words “Reform mental health” and “Our Harvard can do better,” a group of more than 150 students gathered in front of Massachusetts Hall Friday afternoon to urge administrators to take action on mental health.“The drumbeat of student voices for reform is growing, but change is happening too slowly,” Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said in an interview. “It's our responsibility to step in and advocate for students.”The rally came one day after an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/anonymous-schizophrenia-help/"">anonymous Crimson op-ed written by an undergraduate student with schizophrenia generated dialogue in dining halls, on email lists, and on social media sites about perceived flaws in mental health services at Harvard. Also on Thursday, Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira spoke at a Committee on Student Life meeting to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/22/mental-health-new-barreira/"">present several University mental health initiatives, including the hiring of a number of full-time psychiatrists whose work will be devoted exclusively to improving students’ mental well-being.At Friday’s rally, the demonstrators arranged themselves into a large circle, and for one hour, shared personal experiences with UHS and brainstormed a list of specific demands from the administration. That list, in addition to other signs written by demonstrators, was hung on the facade of Massachusetts Hall, which houses the offices of University President Drew G. Faust and other senior administrators.
“I lost 4 friends to suicide in 6 weeks. I’m not better,” read one sign. “Harvard we are MAD,” read another.Twenty minutes into the rally, Assistant Dean for Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña entered the circle and offered a warm room for students to discuss their concerns with administrators and Barreira.“We are willing to sit down, we’ll listen for as long as you want us to be there,” said dela Peña.Although demonstrators turned down the offer and continued their discussion outdoors, dela Peña promised that administrators would review the signs and pass along the list of demands.During the discussion, students called on Harvard to clarify its policies regarding leaves of absences, provide students with advocates within the system, ensure that financial resources do not prevent students from obtaining care, personalize what one student characterized as an “impersonal” system, and hire more therapists to cut down on wait times.Late Friday, UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker released a statement in response to the op-ed that sparked the rally.“The health of Harvard students and all of our patients is of the utmost importance and we consider it to be our top priority,” Baker wrote.In her statement, Baker wrote that there is no monetary cap on prescription drug benefits through the Harvard University Student Health Program, which covers mental health and other health services and is available to all registered students. Baker also wrote that UHS offers need-based financial assistance through a special Medical Hardship Fund and “makes every effort” to schedule appointments in a timely manner.“Anyone with an urgent need can usually be seen within 24 hours, and anyone with an emergency can be seen almost immediately,” she wrote.In the hours before the rally, undergraduates mobilized to promote the demonstration via House mailing lists, Facebook, Twitter, text messages, and word of mouth. Some student groups—including “Our Harvard Can Do Better,” which campaigns for reform of Harvard's sexual assault policies voiced support for the demonstrators’ cause or asked members to attend.

Professors interviewed by The Crimson praised discussions on changing the structure of reading period to better accommodate students who primarily take courses with final papers.The <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/cue-meeting-reading-period/"">proposal, discussed at the Committee on Undergraduate Education’s meeting on Feb. 6, would change the structure of reading period so that final assignments and papers would be due on specified days during exam period rather than reading period. Students would find out exam and due dates during shopping week.“This change, if it goes through, should give students in courses with final projects or papers, rather than final exams, more time to complete them: the result could be more and better learning for everyone,” English professor Stephen L. Burt wrote in an email to The Crimson.Cheryl B. Welch, director of undergraduate studies in the Government Department, told The Crimson in an email that she approves of the proposal.“As different ways of assessing student work have become more common, it seems odd to save a long period only for traditional seated exams,” Welch wrote. “I know of many cases where students get completely jammed up with paper and project deadlines in Reading Period and then have nothing in exam period.”
Folklore and mythology professor Maria Tatar said she regularly encounters students in the humanities with over 70 pages to write during reading period—something that would change if a recent proposal becomes policy. Tatar added that she would be able to expect her students to spend more time on their final papers without the need to rush to finish by the middle of reading period.Amanda J. Claybaugh, an English professor who attended the meeting when Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris introduced the proposal, said that the suggested changes made her consider problems with the current system. The proposal, she said, is an “excellent solution.”“What was interesting to me about the meeting was that I really hadn’t thought about the implications of student scheduling when I [assigned] paper deadlines,” Claybaugh said, adding that her final paper deadlines are during exam period already.Undergraduate Council Education Committee Chair Darragh Nolan ’15, who attended the committee meeting, said the proposal could have positive effects on students because it would give those with multiple final papers more time to complete assignments and ensure that due dates would be spread out.In an interview on the evening of the committee meeting, UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 told The Crimson that many students would probably welcome the change. But going forward in the discussion, she added, the UC wants to make sure that the change would not “add additional burden” on students during “an academically stressful time.""—Staff writer Madeline R.

Harvard College received a record 35,022 applications for the class of 2017, 719 more than last year, the University announced early Friday morning.Although the 2 percent increase represents the first time ever that Harvard’s application numbers have broken the 35,000 mark, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 called this year’s numbers “a continuity.”“We’ve had really about the same number of applications for three years now,” Fitzsimmons said. “From year to year it can almost be noise in the system when you have a small increase or a small decrease.”Fitzsimmons attributed Harvard’s consistently high application numbers to the school’s “steadfast” recruitment process.The College reaches out to potential applicants in a number of ways. Using the College Board’s Student Search Service, Harvard writes to thousands of high school students every year. Admissions officers spend months traveling both internationally and to over 120 American cities to encourage people to apply.
“Really over the past decade or so, we’ve had a very steady outreach,” Fitzsimmons said.According to Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73, the demographic makeup of applicant pool to the Class of 2017 is similar to that of previous years. Following two years when Harvard’s computer science concentration has nearly <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/13/cs-seas-more-concentrators/"">doubled in size, this year’s applicant pool saw a “26 percent increase in prospective computer scientists,” McGrath said in a press release.Fitzsimmons said that although the exact number of applicants may fluctuate from year to year, the admissions office prioritizes ensuring “that we reach, one way or the other, all of the people who have a chance of getting in.”“Our theory is not to focus on the number of applications, but to make sure that the quality and diversity, often the very same thing, of the pool is robust every year,” he said.According to Harvard College Director of Financial Aid Sarah C. Donahue, this year’s applicants demonstrated a greater level of economic diversity than those of year’s past, with 37 percent more students requesting that the application fee be waived—a figure that she said in a press release indicates “more applicants from low- and modest-income backgrounds.”Thus far, the College has already <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/13/early-admissions-regular-action/"">accepted 895 students from an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/29/early-action-2017-harvard/"">early applicant pool of 4,856 people. Those accepted to the Class of 2017 in the fall represent the second group to be admitted early since the University <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/24/harvard-admissions-early-program/"">reinstated its early action program in 2011.Applications to Yale this year rose 3 percent to an all-time high of 29,790. Princeton University received 26,505 applications, and Columbia, 33,460.The University of Pennsylvania received 31,219 applications—one more than the 31,218 it received last year. About 22,400 applied to Dartmouth and 28,807 to Brown.—Staff writer Zohra D. Yaqhubi can be reached at zyaqhubi@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter @zohradyaqhubi.

The Dark Chocolate Decadence ($6) is the restaurant's gluten-free dessert option. This rich, flourless chocolate torte was messily drizzled with Chambord sauce made from raspberries, vanilla, honey, and cognac.The Chocolate Pecan Bread Pudding ($6), served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, had big chunks of pecans and chocolate chips. The bread pudding would have tasted better if it had been crispier on top and moister inside.

A social evil law to better the situation is hopeless, for it is unconstitutional. He summed up the fallacies of our present ignorant system as follows: ""We turn the entire problem over to police, giving them three distinct powers which they abuse. They are allowed to make pseudo-laws to regulate vice; they are then expected to enforce these laws and punish offenders.""<!--more-->

He feels guilty for the entire year 1968—the assassinations, the riots, the rise of Wallace, the blood in Chicago. Saying that liberals feel guilty about things is somewhat a cliché (that is, after all, how we normally discount what they say). But look at what it means to feel guilty.First, guilt implies a sense of responsibility for events. Few normal people feel guilty about what happened in Chicago. They may feel outraged or happy about it, but to feel guilt is the prerogative of those who feel responsible. The liberal journalists who feel this way are saying that somehow they could have prevented what happened in Chicago or that they could have refrained from causing what happened.

No, I am not saying government is not “rocket science,” nor am I saying it is not “an exact science.” Government, simply put, is not a science. This is not to say that government should not use science, but rather that it should view science as a tool and not the basis of all insight.It’s entirely understandable why government wants to be considered a science. Firstly, science describes things in definite terms. We can argue endlessly about whether Harvard is too liberal but we only have to count to discover <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/5/crimson-presidential-poll-2012/"">11.6 percent of Harvard votes Republican. The complex ideas we express in words take such energy to write, read, and debate, whereas a pie chart is a pie chart is a pie chart.Secondly, the potential payoff of a foolproof formula for election prediction is incalculable.  Half of the Harvard student body worships before the secular altar of <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/11/silver-politics-baseball-statistics/"">Nate Silver, and no, I do not have statistics to back that up. But why stop at description or prediction alone? Why not prescription! With the proper formula a scientist could produce “perfect” policies and to prove it, here are the numbers! Not convinced? Try more numbers!Yet, for government to be treated as a science, certain assumptions have to be made that are contrary to the traditional conceptions of governing bodies. Government is fundamentally normative. Government exists to govern and to implement policy, courses of action to achieve aims. The “aims” of government are not reducible to hard and fast rules of nature like those concerning survival and evolution. Government is contrived from subjective morals and personal preferences. Science must be nothing more than a tool to examine a fundamentally normative premise. To derive from science the aim of government is to have the tail wagging the dog (which, as science tells me, is not what actually happens).Science proper is the study of the natural and physical world by means of observation and experiment. The study of government is neither physical nor natural. How does one observe, say, the height or weight of a law? How does one physically transform into a senator? The government is supposed to exist to transcend the physical. We don’t need laws to be tangible to be effective or senators to transform for them to gain power. Neither is government natural. In fact, government was our solution when we wanted to escape nature. I keep waiting for my pet hamsters to form a proper assembly, but no luck yet.
Most importantly, scientists (real scientists, mind you) feel the need to distinguish between the “social sciences” and themselves. It is no coincidence that shortly after political academics started calling their field a science, departments like chemistry and physics responded by calling themselves “hard sciences.” I like the implication of this distinction; one may study hard science or easy-feeble-soft-kitten science.I respect Harvard for having a “government” department and not a “political science” department. Yet the department lauds its aspiring political scientists with research grants, shiny new professors, and oodles of class options. Meanwhile the department forgets about its theorists and historians, the scientists’ moody, middle-aged, unemployed siblings.I speak solely about the government department because I have firsthand experience with it. I’ve read countless papers attempting to shoehorn philosophy into formulas. I’ve seen students in section cite the Solow residual and wait patiently to be offered tenure at Yale. Quotes from Aristotle make for a good paper heading but are left unexamined.  Government has swung towards empiricism over rationalism. We think about what we observe and few observe what we actually think. Psychology has taken the place of political theory. Statistics has assumed the role of political history.But just because something is normative or unverifiable does not mean it is not worthy of study. In fact, precisely because government is normative and unverifiable, it is extremely important to study. Anyone can talk politics and that’s what makes government so great and so difficult. “Political science” is, to a degree, elitist because few know the proper scientific terms. Anyone can argue what counts as an individual’s “right,” but few can tell me what homoscedasticity is. (Though it obviously means to have the same “scedasticity”).  As <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=w.s.+gilbert&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"">Gilbert, of Gilbert and Sullivan put it, “If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me, why, what a very singularly deep young man this deep young man must be!”Back when MIT’s political science department included sociology, one mathematician noticed this very same trend. So I’ll leave you with the lyrics of Thomas A. Lehrer, Harvard grad, part-time mathematician, part-time musician, and full-time <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfZWyUXn3So"">genius:Joes, who wrote prose,Now write algebra, who knows —It may be sociology…They consult, sounding occult,Talking like a Mathematics PhD.They can snow all their clients,By calling it science,Although it's only sociology!Sarah R.

To some, the “preponderance of the evidence” standard is <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/womensenews/2012/05/17/campus-safety-bill-endangers-rape-prosecutions/ "">“crucial to the fair and equal treatment of women.” To others, it is a <a href=""http://thefire.org/article/13805.html "">“fatally flawed” path to “injustice” that erodes the rights of students.In recent months, an expired piece of legislation has placed a few words of legal jargon, tucked away in the disciplinary codes of colleges and universities all over the country, at the forefront of a polarizing national debate. The argument centers around a charged question: how much evidence should an institution of higher education require to find an accused student guilty of sexual misconduct?The preponderance of the evidence standard might not mean much to the average American, but to many of the activists watching Congress debate the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, it is a pivot point for the future of America’s universities. Those four words have been caught in the middle of a months-long battle to renew the legislation, which contains new provisions that explicitly regulate the sexual assault investigations conducted by institutions of higher education.An early draft of VAWA contained language which would have mandated colleges and universities to adopt the standard, which would make it easier to discipline students accused of sexual misconduct. But last week, the U.S. Senate approved a version of VAWA that dropped the clause entirely. The Senate’s bill must still be reconciled with a rival version in the House of Representatives before it can be signed into law by President Barack Obama.For schools like Harvard, which do not use the preponderance of the evidence standard, the Senate’s bill offers a momentary reprieve from external pressure to adopt a lower burden of proof. But even though it does not legally require Harvard to alter its standard of evidence, the bill still leaves the door open for federally mandated changes in the way the Administrative Board handles cases of sexual assault.

FOUR WORDSDrafted in 1994 by then-senator Joe Biden, VAWA allocated federal funds to help streamline the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against both men and women.The act was reauthorized in 2000 and 2005 with bipartisan support, but hit a snag when it was considered for renewal in 2012. House Republicans objected to new provisions that extended parts of the legislation to Indian reservations and  undocumented immigrants. Ultimately, differences between the versions of the bill drafted by the Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican House prevented the legislation from being renewed before 2013.At the same time, a separate debate raged over new portions of the bill that concerned sexual assault on college campuses. An early draft of VAWA incorporated much of the language of the Campus SaVE Act, a bill that Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey introduced in 2011 to reduce sexual violence on college campuses. Among other changes, the bill would have mandated that colleges and universities adopt the preponderance of the evidence metric when investigating sexual assault cases.The standard, which is also the legal burden of proof used in U.S. civil courts, would require that a university’s disciplinary body be at least 51 percent convinced of a student’s guilt before meting out a punishment for a sexual offence. Compared to the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal courts that deal with sexual assault, a preponderance of the evidence rule requires less certainty.LOOKING INWARDCurrently, Harvard has no standardized burden of proof for disciplinary proceedings across its various schools. The Law School uses the more stringent “clear and convincing evidence” standard—typically considered to require about 80 percent certainty of guilt—and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences mandates that the members of the Administrative Board be <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/25/ad-board-burden-process/"">“sufficiently persuaded” of an accused student’s guilt before assigning a punishment.While the Law School’s standard has been criticized for making it difficult for victims to attain justice, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ standard has come under fire for being too vague.“I think it’s very unclear what ‘sufficiently persuaded’ means,” said Kristi L. Jobson ’06, a law clerk at the Massachusetts Appeals Court. “It could be lower than preponderance of evidence or higher than that. We just don’t know.”In the Ivy League, only Harvard and Princeton do not use the preponderance of the evidence standard. Princeton employs a “clear and persuasive” standard.

I’m probably the only one, but with <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/16/committee-to-relieve-stress/"">all the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/10/suicide-harvard-mental-health/"">talk about depression at Harvard my mind has been jumping to John Stuart Mill, who once <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=WNshi5exu3YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">argued, “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.”I said it to my Social Studies tutorial sophomore year and I’ll say it again: I’d be a happy pig over a miserable man any day. Mill offers various reasons why he thinks few people would agree to become one of the “lower” animals, including pride, independence, power, and dignity. None of those things really get me inspired to be an unhappy human being. And I certainly wouldn’t care much about them if I were a pig (though future pig research may prove me wrong). Give me some slop and some mud, and you can go on contemplating the meaninglessness of life.The memory made me wonder whether Harvard students’ intelligence may be the cause of our <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/10/suicide-harvard-mental-health/"">higher-than-average rates of depression and suicide.Many point primarily to Harvard’s pressure-cooker failure-shaming environment. Lord knows that there is truth to that characterization, though I would argue that your average Harvard student pressures himself infinitely more than anyone else does.What, though, converts this pressure-induced stress into chronic depression and suicidal thoughts? High intelligence may be the culprit.
Though I could find no study showing a correlation between generic depression and intelligence, psychologist James Webb <a href=""http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Articles_id_10269.aspx"">reports that highly intelligent people are more likely to suffer from what he terms “existential depression,” which entails struggles with certain basic issues of existence: mortality, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness.Translation: Death is inevitable. No one can decide what life path you should choose but you, and there are no absolute standards by which to judge your decision. No matter how close you grow to another person, a gap will always remain. “Meaninglessness stems from the first three,” Webb explained after waking up on the wrong side of the bed. “If we must die, if we construct our own world, and if each of us is ultimately alone, then what meaning does life have?”Existential crises are a universal phenomenon, of course, but they seem to happen particularly frequently and severely with Harvard students. Perhaps our analytical or <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000238"">secular tendencies stubbornly refuse to allow us to ignore the absurdities of life. Perhaps Harvard students take an unusually nasty shock to their sense of place in the universe when they discover that they are no longer smarter than everyone around them or destined to change history.Woody Allen once <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/25/AR2006072501666.html"">said, “It's very hard to keep your spirits up. You've got to keep selling yourself a bill of goods, and some people are better at lying to themselves than others. If you face reality too much, it kills you.”Cynical? Sure. True? For a lot of students here, yes.My hunch is that being intelligent makes it harder to sell yourself a bill of goods. A lot of Harvard students are overextended, unhappy, concentrating in subjects they dislike, and entering careers they have no interest in. They know it, too, but won’t take the pressure off themselves for fear of admitting defeat. For <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/17/harvard-many-feel-out/"">some, depression and suicidal thoughts may result.For many Harvard students, college is a brutal cycle of crushing course loads, demanding extracurriculars, endless deadlines, lack of sleep, frayed nerves, loneliness, and numbing, debaucherous escapes. Some eventually <a href=""http://mentalhealthmatters-harvard.tumblr.com/"">question whether Harvard is really worth it in the end.“Why can’t I hack it? Besides, is the opportunity to go spend a few more years of my life in another potentially highly stressful environment – whether it’s Wall Street, consulting, medical school, or law school – worth being unhappy and stressed during the four years that many of my friends are spending at party schools? If it’s not, then why am I here? And how could I leave without having to endure the barely concealed judgment of classmates, friends, and family who thought I could handle Harvard?”Obviously I cannot presume to fully understand anyone else’s depression, and the picture of mental health at Harvard that I’ve sketched is not comprehensive. But I believe it is part of the reality, and having a better understanding of why the Harvard personality type may be converting school stress into existential crises allows us to more effectively help those suffering from depression on campus. For better or worse, we are a campus closer to the Socrates end of the spectrum than the fool end. We need mental health resources that can address the accompanying unique concerns (since pig reincarnation, scientists tell us, is decades away).Oftentimes, though, no <a href=""http://huhs.harvard.edu/HealthServices/MentalHealthServices.aspx"">therapist or <a href=""http://mentalhealthmatters-harvard.tumblr.com/"">Tumblr or voice on a <a href=""http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~room13/aboutus.html"">hotline (useful as they are) can substitute for another regular human being who’ll sit in front of someone they can sense isn’t quite right, look him or her in the eyes, ask what’s wrong, mean it, and listen. We all have a responsibility to be that person, and there’s no shortage of students here waiting for someone to reach out.Wyatt N.

It seemed as though a game that the Harvard women’s basketball team had once led by double digits was slipping away, when Brown guard Sheila Dixon grabbed an offensive board off of a missed three and sunk a trey to whittle the lead down to two.But junior guard Christine Clark had other ideas. In the final 30 seconds, Clark went five-for-six from the line to defend the Crimson’s home territory, a court on which Harvard (15-8, 6-3 Ivy) has yet to lose this season.Sharp shooting from senior forward Victoria Lippert and clutch rebounding down the stretch on Friday night prevented the Bears (8-16, 2-8) from snatching the Crimson’s 77-71 victory, despite Brown’s best efforts to pull out an upset.“I thought that it was a great team win at the end, we really came together,” Clark said. “People started taking care of the ball, we started getting defensive stops when we needed to, and it shouldn’t have been that close, but I’m glad that we pulled out the win.”Lippert notched the first four points for Harvard and never looked back. The senior tallied 14 points in the first half alone and finished with a season-high 24 points on 10-for-20 shooting, including three from behind the arc, putting her in second place in Harvard history for career three-pointers made behind Erin Maher ’93.
“[Lippert is] one of the most tried-and-true consistent players,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.  “She’s playing like a senior, she’s playing like a senior star, and where maybe she was an offensive player throughout her career, I think her defense and rebounding have evolved to match her offense this year.”After entering halftime with the score knotted at 37, the Crimson wasted no time in putting space between itself and the Bears. Lippert stole the ball on Brown’s first possession and drove it down the court to give Harvard its first lead since the 4:11 mark in the first half.A few minutes and two three-pointers from the senior later, Harvard pushed its lead to 12, but turnovers on missed passes and fouls cut the advantage down, as the Crimson surpassed the foul limit with nearly six minutes to play.“We underperformed,” Delaney-Smith said. “I can’t get this team to put together a whole game to their capabilities and I haven’t had a better team in practice. I think this team does a great job in practice, I don’t understand why we can’t do the same things in a game. I respect their work, but we make mistakes in games, and in every game, there seems to be something slightly different. I’m always slightly caught off-guard by what’s going to show up.”Bears guard Sophie Bikofsky led Brown’s multi-faceted attack, which featured four different players in double figures, putting up 19 points against a team that she once considered joining.“They’re all dangerous,” Delaney-Smith said. “They have a kid from Newton that wanted to come here, and that’s Sophie Bikofsky, who had a great game, did a terrific job…. I expected Brown to [play this well], but I expected us to play better.”The Bears jumped out to a quick 8-4 lead, but Harvard kept pace with Brown, trading jumpers, and the margin between the teams never surpassed four points in the first half. Although the Crimson pulled down nearly three times as many boards as the visiting team and held a 12-0 second-chance point advantage, the team coughed the ball up 11 times to a stingy Bears defense, preventing any substantial lead from forming.“I think that Brown—wherever we play them—it’s always a challenge,” Clark said. “They come in with a very strong underdog attitude, and so they really play like they have nothing to lose. This is actually the first time, in my time here, that we’ve swept them in Ivy League play.”Both teams rained in shots from downtown, with the Bears attempting treys 18 times and the Crimson tossing up 25 attempts, tying its most for the season, a product of Brown’s interior defense.“They literally said that they did not want to defend any of our forwards in the paint, particularly [sophomore forward] Temi [Fagbenle], so if you looked at them, they had sagging man-to-man defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think there was a zone occasionally, but it was all in the paint, so they gave us threes, 15-footers, 18-footers, and that’s not a bad shot for us.”Fagbenle and Clark joined Lippert in double figures for the Crimson, putting up 17 and 16 points, respectively.—Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samanthalin@college.harvard.edu.

NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Much like in November, when the two football programs met at Harvard Stadium, the Harvard and Yale men’s basketball Saturday matchup—a 72-66 Crimson victory—was a heated affair from start to finish.It started from the tip, with ringing chants of “Harvard sucks” echoing throughout the gymnasium. It continued into the second half, when Bulldog Austin Morgan knocked down a three to tie the game and mimicked junior co-captain Laurent Rivard’s celebration on his way up the court. It peaked with Javier Duren’s late flagrant foul on freshman guard Siyani Chambers, a push with four seconds left that sent Chambers careening into the Bulldog bench.“We will get a chance to honestly evaluate it better as we watch the film but I thought we were tough when we needed to be,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly we did some things we didn’t do against Brown, and I was very pleased with that. I think there are a lot of things we carried from the last game that we didn’t do well and fixed them.”After frontcourt teammates and sophomore forwards Steve Moundou-Missi and Kenyatta Smith carried the Crimson (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) in double-digit wins over Penn and Princeton the weekend before, it was the guards’ turn to shoulder much of the load against Yale (11-16, 5-5 Ivy).Although Moundou-Missi scored 17 points on six-of-seven shooting, the four Harvard guards—Chambers, Rivard, sophomore Wesley Saunders, and co-captain Christian Webster—combined for 51 of the team’s 72 points. Amaker said that the Bulldogs were able to throw Smith off his game with more physical play.
“We want to go inside,” Amaker said. “We want to play inside out, and we didn’t get a lot from it but we are trying to see if we can get the ball in the paint from dribble or by pass for Kenyatta because he is aggressive on the interior. Knowing he has been a force for our team, they played very physical and very hard and made it very difficult for him to maneuver and to get shots.”Rivard shook off a 0-of-7 night from the field on Friday against Brown to make three treys Saturday, combining with Webster to knock down five in the second half from beyond the arc. Chambers contributed seven assists along with 14 points, hitting two free throws in the final 90 seconds to help seal the deal.“It’s always exciting to play in that kind of environment,” Moundou-Missi said. “That’s what you want as a college basketball player. I think we got better today and we are taking a step forward to what we can become as a team. It showed our mental toughness and we battled through the game.”In the first half, the Crimson struggled from deep, making one of seven, but Saunders poured in 12 points to keep Harvard narrowly ahead of its rival at the break.After carrying a 34-28 lead into halftime, the Crimson extended the lead to seven on a Rivard three with 16 minutes left to play.But Duren and Bulldog forward Justin Sears went on their own 9-0 run, putting Yale up two with 13 minutes to go. After the Bulldogs extended the lead to six, Harvard mounted a 7-0 run on two Chambers assists and an and-one to take a 58-57 lead it would never relinquish.“It’s always tough against them,” Moundou-Missi said. “You have to give them credit for their toughness, but you need to battle through it, and that’s what has us in first. It was a good game, and [while] I wouldn’t call it a statement, it is a great win for us.”The Bulldogs began the game on a hot streak, scoring on four of their first seven possessions to take a 9-5 lead at the under-sixteen timeout.But after the timeout, Saunders scored 10 of the Crimson’s next 13 points to help Harvard take an 18-13 lead. His high-rising dunk over two Yale defenders—extending his arm to slam the ball home even as he fell to the hardwood—energized the Crimson faithful, but Saunders did not score in the last nine minutes as Harvard fell cold from the field.The Crimson has now won four in a row, sweeping Penn and Princeton last weekend for only the second time in eight tries and defeating Brown and Yale on the road over the weekend to maintain the 1.5-game lead over the Princeton Tigers.—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

A Saturday morning report of a gunman at MIT that prompted a campus-wide lockdown was a hoax, authorities said.The Cambridge Police Department said it received a report at approximately 7:28 a.m. that a man was inside a building in the Main Group complex on MIT’s campus with a gun. The gunman was reported to have a “long rifle and body armour,” according to an MIT emergency alert message.CPD officers reached the scene at 7:30 a.m., secured the area, and searched the buildings thoroughly, room-by-room. MIT sent out an emergency message telling students to stay indoors or seek shelter at about 8:45 a.m. But when CPD’s hunt yielded no results, the lockdown was called off at 10:45 a.m.In a statement released shortly after 12:30 p.m., CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote, “No armed suspects were found in the building or on campus, and police believe that the event, as reported, did not occur.”The Main Group, which rests at the center of MIT’s campus, comprises a group of facilities under 77 Massachusetts Ave., MIT’s flagship mailing address.

Sporting a Harvard sweatshirt over a black and white dress, singer Nicole Scherzinger accepted the 2013 Artist of the Year Award before a lively audience at the matinee show of the 28th annual Cultural Rhythms festival Saturday afternoon.Scherzinger, the former lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls, was honored by the Harvard Foundation as part of a day of festivities—including a luncheon, a food festival, and an evening show of student performances—all celebrating cultural diversity on campus.Scherzinger, who is of Hawaiian, Filipino, and Russian descent and grew up in Kentucky, is <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/nicole-scherzinger-cultural-rhythms/"">the first person of Asian-American heritage to receive the award. In her acceptance speech, she called the honor “an affirmation that at least I’m on the right path.”Throughout the show, Scherzinger embraced the spirit of the day. After the Harvard Philippine Forum’s performance, she sang “Happy Birthday” to one of the students dancers—in Italian.“It’s amazing how people from all different backgrounds can take part,” said Scherzinger. “That would explain why I saw the Asian people in the mariachi band earlier. It was beautiful.”
Cracking jokes between acts, Scherzinger also engaged the audience with her sharp and self-deprecating humor. At one point, she posed for a selfie with one of the Irish step dancers.Scherzinger was introduced at the show by honorary host United States Treasurer Rosa G. Rios ’87, who co-founded Cultural Rhythms as an undergraduate.“Culture is about experiencing life,” said Rios, returning to the same stage where she once performed. Rios recited a list of Scherzinger’s diverse achievements and contributions, including her performance of “The Phantom of the Opera” for the Queen of England and her philanthropic work to fight human trafficking and breast cancer.Scherzinger was joined on stage by a number of student groups who performed at the show. Nearly all of them gave Scherzinger a rose at the conclusion of their acts.First up was the Harvard College Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble, featuring fast drumming and barefoot dancers. The group was followed by the Mariachi Veritas de Harvard, who played traditional music on guitars and violins.“How does it feel to be so smart and talented?” Scherzinger asked two of the Mariachi Veritas performers. “I’m starting to feel like an underachiever here.”Then came Harvard Wushu, who combined martial arts and dance in a traditional Chinese performance. The performers twirled fake swords just inches away from Scherzinger’s face.Later in the show, Scherzinger got up to dance in her black pumps alongside the Harvard Breakers during their breakdancing routine.The finale featured an ensemble of performers from every group dancing along to “When I Grow Up” by the Pussycat Dolls. Without hesitation, Scherzinger took the microphone and sang on top of her own vocals.—Staff writer Anneli L.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—At times, the Harvard men’s basketball team’s performance on Friday night seemed to leave the door open for a potential upset that would have shaken up the Ivy  League standings.But just as soon as Brown had capitalized on a Crimson dry spell to cut its deficit to six in the second half, the Bears’ self-destructive play prevented them from making things more interesting.The crowd at the Pizzitola Sports Center in Providence, R.I., which had been mostly indifferent to the first 30 minutes of action, began to wake up as the home team put together a 12-3 run, turning what had threatened to be a blowout into a 39-33 game and calling to mind Brown’s furious comeback in Cambridge earlier this season.From that point, the Bears’ momentum was effectively stopped by two missed free throws, two missed three-pointers, and a turnover, and Harvard (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) was able to once more steadily increase its advantage. It was the closest the Crimson would allow the Bears (10-14, 4-6) to get, finishing them off by a final tally of 65-47.Though Harvard had an uncharacteristically poor shooting night, converting on only two of its 12 attempts from beyond the arc and 21 of 37 trips to the free throw line, it wasn’t going to take a superhuman effort to defeat a team that was having as many difficulties putting the ball in the hoop as Brown was.
The Bears were 1-for-14 from three-point range and shot just 37.2 percent from the field as a team. Combined with 19 turnovers—compared to six for the Crimson—Brown gave itself virtually no chance to take down heavily-favored Harvard, which, to its credit, defended the Bears tightly throughout the game.“I thought our defense against the three-point line was one of the more credible things we were trying to accomplish tonight,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly, they missed a ton, as we did, from the three-point line.”SUPER SAUNDERSOnce again, the Crimson offense was powered by Saunders, who submitted another performance to put him at the forefront of the Ivy Player of the Year discussion. Saunders finished with 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting, but it was his nine rebounds that most impressed his coach.“I was very, very impressed with [his rebound total] because we’ve been on him about getting on the glass,” Amaker said. “That’s a big number for a wing player.”Saunders’ night could have been even bigger had he been more efficient from the free throw line. Despite getting to the charity stripe 13 times, Saunders hit only five of his attempts, much to the delight of the Bears’ student section. However, he was able to quiet the jeering fans with a fast-break dunk that put the Crimson up 11 points with 8:40 remaining, putting an end to Brown’s comeback attempt.GOING SMALLHarvard played almost the entirety of Friday’s game with a four-guard lineup, as Saunders, Rivard, freshman Siyani Chambers, and captain Christian Webster all played at least 37 of the game’s 40 minutes.Some of this was out of necessity—foul trouble plagued the Crimson bigs throughout the game. Coming off of his Ivy Player of the Week performance, sophomore Kenyatta Smith got the start ahead of sophomore Jonah Travis.But Smith was on the court for only six minutes in the first half after picking up two quick fouls. The second half was a similar story, with Smith being whistled twice more in eight minutes and having to sit for the rest of the contest.“He is a shot blocker, and he’s done that very well, but you need to still play defense and play before your man gets [the ball],” Amaker said. “I think sometimes as a great shot blocker you play behind, and Kenyatta was giving up too much post position.”Sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi, Harvard’s first big man off the bench, also finished the game with four fouls.After being a mainstay in the starting lineup for most of the season, Travis has seen his minutes cut drastically in the last week.Travis was on the court for 11 total minutes in last weekend’s games against Penn and Princeton. Even with his teammates’ foul trouble, he received just 10 minutes against the Bears, finishing with three points and three rebounds.—Staff Writer Andrew R.

When you got into Harvard, you probably thought that you had escaped rejection forever. Not so fast. You may be among the best and the brightest—but so is everyone else. Everyone wants to apply to everything, and so rejection from student organizations—whether it's an a Capella group or the Asian-American Brotherhood—seems inevitable. After all, they can't take everyone. This phenomenon of rejection seems to be even more prevalent this year. With applications to the College at <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/22/record-high-applications-2017/"">a record high, more high school seniors will face rejection from Harvard this year than ever before.On campus, while the number of new members accepted by student groups has remained relatively constant, the number of applicants, auditionees, and compers has shot up.<!--more--> FOP (the Freshmen Outdoor Program) tends to accept around forty new leader applicants each year. Yet, even with a 33 percent increase in applications, they simply didn't have the space to take more new leaders, having to turn away many qualified applicants.These application jumps are difficult for both sides of the application process. ""We had a huge rise in applications this year, which made decisions much, much harder,"" said FOP Steering Committee member Grace L. Chen '15, who is an inactive Crimson photo editor.
Ben L. Donald '15, president of the Harvard Opportunes, a co-ed a cappella ensemble, said that 25 percent more students auditioned this fall than last fall, yet there was no increase in the size of the group.This trend also rang true with DAPA (Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors), who actually reduced the number of new members that they accepted this year.""Communication and attendance is key to making DAPA's endeavors successful, and because of this, we aim to keep our membership at a certain intimate level,"" said Kendall L. Sherman '15, a member of DAPA's selection committee.Why the sudden jump in applications? We at Flyby do not have a straightforward answer. We just want to keep you informed as you start getting nervous for your upcoming interviews, auditions, and socials. Good luck!

This category is stocked with Oscar familiars—four of them have previously taken home the Supporting Actor statue, while the fifth, Philip Seymour Hoffman, has but a Best Actor award to his name. They play more or less the character types for which they’ve been lauded, from Tommy Lee Jones’s stonefaced, softhearted senator in “Lincoln” to Alan Arkin’s droll geezer in “Argo.” But Robert De Niro’s turn in “Silver Linings Playbook” is exceptional—the veteran actor humanizes his gruff patriarchal role by inflecting it with a moving portrayal of mental illness.Effecting an expertly cultivated volatility, De Niro controls all of his scenes. His character’s financial, familial, and obsessive-compulsive anxieties strain his expressions, and the tension this creates is captivating. The internal struggle of the Philadelphia Eagles-obsessed father he plays never lets up—De Niro’s always working, shakily holding together the football fan’s brashness and obsessive insecurities.Also to his credit, he keeps aloft an aspect of the film otherwise dropped. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence’s storyline initially concerns their characters’ psychological instabilities, but then veers toward sports and romance; De Niro’s performance keeps the movie’s discussion of mental illness from feeling thin. It’s a worthy portrayal and one of the film’s best components.—Staff writer Austin Siegemund-Broka can be reached at asiegemund-broka@college.harvard.edu.

The phrase <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/2/16/kremlin-on-the-charles/"">""Kremlin on the Charles"" may not be as outdated as you think.According to Republican Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, Harvard Law School was more Red than Crimson as recently as 1995, when he graduated.A spokeswoman for Cruz said that the Senator <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/02/ted-cruz-responds-harvard-law-was-full-of-communists.html"">still stands behind comments he made in at a political rally on July 4, 2010, in which he accused the Harvard Law School faculty of having a stark communist bent. (These comments were recently <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/02/ted-cruz-sees-red-not-crimson-at-harvard.html#ixzz2LrSEnxf9"">brought to the fore by New Yorker writer Jane Mayer in the wake of what she called Senator Cruz's ""prosecutorial style"" of questioning Chuck Hagel, President Obama's nominee for Secretary of Defense.)<!--more-->Cruz's spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, defended the senator's comments by telling <a href=""http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/23/ted-cruz-responds-to-new-mccarthy-new-yorker-article-curious-they-would-dredge-up-a-3-year-old-speech-call-it-news/"">The Blaze that, indeed, ""the Harvard Law School faculty included numerous self-described proponents of 'critical legal studies'—a school of thought explicitly derived from Marxism—and they far outnumbered Republicans.""In his 2010 speech, Cruz said that President Barack Obama ""would have made a perfect president of Harvard Law School"" after he attacked Obama as ""the most radical"" President ""ever to occupy the Oval Office.""
Cruz also said that ""there were twelve [Communists] who would say they were Marxists who believed in the Communists overthrowing the United States government.""Robb London, director of communications for the Law School, told the <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/02/ted-cruz-sees-red-not-crimson-at-harvard.html"">New Yorker, ""We are puzzled by the Senator's assertions, as we are unaware of any basis for them.""This is certainly not the first time since the days of McCarthyism that Harvard has been accused of promoting communism and/or the overthrow of the United States as we know it. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/15/harvard-training-communists/"">Last fall, Bloomberg News published an article that described Harvard as a training grounds for the world's most prominent Communist leaders.It's unclear where Harvard stands on communism these days—after all, Cruz was here in the mid-90s, and the Bloomberg-exposed trainees have come and gone. But while we're not sure exactly what goes on north of Harvard Yard (or at the Kennedy School, for that matter) it does seem safe to say that things are fine for now. Although, if Barack Obama wanted to come back to campus, that could be <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/15/early-crimson-coverage-obama/"">cool. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1991/1/31/haa-and-hraaa-name-candidates-pin/"">Obama for Board of Overseers in 2016?

It looked as if the Harvard men’s hockey team (7-16-3, 4-13-2 ECAC) was going to continue a recent trend, continuing its momentum through the final games of the regular season after entering Friday night’s game against St. Lawrence (16-11-4, 9-6-4 ECAC) on a season-high four-game unbeaten streak.Freshman forward Jimmy Vesey had put the Crimson up 2-1 early in third period at Appleton Arena on Friday, with assists from sophomore Colin Blackwell and assistant captain Alex Fallstrom.But midway through the final frame, that lead would quickly disappear.After a tripping penalty on captain Danny Biega at 7:57 in the third, Saint senior defenseman George Hughes netted a power-play goal to tie the score at two, with helpers from captain Kyle Flanagan and junior Justin Baker.Just 12 seconds later, freshman forward Greg Carey claimed the lead for St. Lawrence, scoring what would be the game winner, assisted by Jeremy Wick and Jordan Dewey.
With the victory, the Saints increase their winning streak to four, highlighted by an upset one week ago against No. 1 Quinnipiac, where they handed the top-ranked Bobcats their first lost in 22 games.Harvard remains in last place in the ECAC with the loss to second-place St. Lawrence. With three games remaining in the regular season, and the Crimson five points behind the nearest teams in the standings (Cornell and Colgate), Harvard will need some help to escape from its first last place finish in at least 50 years.In the first period, the Crimson took the first lead of the game with a power-play goal from senior Marshall Everson, his fifth straight game with a goal, a career-high goal-streak. Biega and senior Luke Greiner earned the assists.Around five minutes later at 11:20 in the period, Flanagan knotted the score at one with help from Pat Raley and Justin Bruckel.Despite the loss, Harvard outshot St. Lawrence, 26-25, and junior goalie Raphael Girard had 21 saves on the night for the Crimson.—Staff writer David Mazza can be reached at davidmazza@college.harvard.edu.

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team outscored UMass in the final two frames and held even with the Minutemen in the first. But that was not enough to knock off the No. 5/7 team in the county.A 4-0 surge in the second quarter propelled UMass (3-0) to an 8-6 victory in the Crimson’s season opener at Soldier’s Field Lacrosse/Soccer Stadium. Harvard (1-0) edged the Minutemen in the second half, 4-2, but could not close the gap.“I thought we played very hard, tough, and physical lacrosse,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “Overall, I thought the effort was incredible. But the execution in the middle of the field and, at times, in the offensive end, wasn’t good enough to beat a great team.”Harvard senior midfielder Alex White led all scorers with a hat trick.“Al played really well all day,” Wojcik said. “He did a great job exploiting match-ups, [and] he did a great job generating really good shots.”
UMass jumped out to a 2-0 lead three minutes into the game with a pair of unassisted markers from Matt Whippen and Grant Whiteway. But strikes from White and senior attacker Jack Walker allowed the Crimson to draw even before the end of the first period. Harvard goaltender Harry Krieger made five of his game-high 13 shots in the opening frame.“[Krieger] has really stepped up,” White said. “He’s bailed us out a lot, really kept us in that game. He’s been playing really well. Hopefully, he doesn’t have to bail us out every game. He’s a good player; it’s nice having that back there.”The second quarter proved the difference as four different UMass scorers found the back of the net. Sean Cleary and Kyle Smith opened up the period’s scoring for the Minutemen with strikes less than a minute apart. Junior attacker Connor Mooney provided UMass a 6-2 lead with just over a minute left in the half. On the other end, UMass redshirt freshman Zachary Oliveri made three of his eight saves of the game.“They really controlled the play in that second quarter. Their goalie made a few big stops and kind of stymied our momentum,” Wojcik said. “And they had great possession time. They capitalized on their chances, and we didn’t.”Harvard challenged the Minutemen down the stretch as the Crimson defense limited UMass to only one goal per period in the second half. In the first minute of the third, Ryan Stevens skipped a shot between the legs of Oliveri.“We had a really good scout on them,” White said. “I think our intensity and effort was there on defense, and we had a good plan.”The squads traded punches as UMass’s Andrew Sokol responded a minute and a half later with a spinning shot at the top of the box, drawing a body check infraction from Robert Dunjvak in the process. But, shorthanded, the Crimson found the net 35 seconds later as White bounced another five-hole shot across the goal line.“All I wanted to do was to kill the penalty so we could get back to even,” White said of his man-down strike. “But I looked in the middle of the field and the whole defense was kind of looking the other way.”In the fourth, the Crimson drew within two goals off of a third, unassisted tally from White. Wippen scored his second goal of the match with 5:36 left in regulation to put the Minutemen up, 8-5, but Harvard countered 36 seconds later with a man-up goal from senior attacker Henry Mumford.The Crimson managed only one more shot in the final five minutes of play as UMass dominated possession down the stretch. The Minutemen effectively navigated the newly-implemented stall rules, maximizing the 30-second shot clock and avoiding turnovers.With just over a minute left, a push from Harvard captain Jason Gonos put the Crimson a man down, and UMass eased its way to victory.“It was difficult for us to extend there once we were a man down,” Wojcik said. “So we were really chasing from there,”UMass has now won 17 straight regular season games in a streak that dates back to April 2011.—Staff writer Michael D.

Despite missing junior co-captain Nick Madden to injury, the No. 15 Harvard men’s volleyball team continued its streak of dominance this week, earning its third and fourth consecutive straight-set victories over NJIT (3-10, 1-3 EIVA) and Rutgers-Newark (2-6, 0-4), respectively.The Crimson (9-2, 5-1) entered the weekend fresh off of a historic victory last Friday over conference foe and then-No. 9 Penn State.“I think it is easy to get on a big high after a big win like that and to lose focus and to look past some of your other opponents,” co-captain Rob Lothman said.With Madden out, freshman Branden Clemens moved from his usual outside hitter position to right side attacker, and junior Michael Owen started at outside hitter.“I think Branden stepped up and filled my position really well,” Madden said. “I think Michael Owen really stepped up too, because he had to fill Branden’s position.”
HARVARD 3, RUTGERS-NEWARK 0After sweeping NJIT on Friday, Harvard carried its momentum into Saturday’s matchup at Rutgers-Newark.“Saturday, we were primarily focused on our half of the court,” Lothman said. “We had done some scouting of Rutgers, so we felt pretty confident that we knew what they had to bring against us.”Harvard was down, 14-11, in the third set before going on a 14-4 run to close out the match.“We were able to keep the pressure on them late,” Lothman said. “When we got into those late game situations, we were able to score the points that mattered.”Outstanding play by Clemens sparked the victory, which keeps Harvard just a half game behind the first place Nittany Lions in the EIVA. The freshman had 12 kills as part of an impressive .625 hitting percentage on the day. He also tallied three aces, three digs, and two blocks.“On Saturday, [Branden] was definitely a major outlet,” Lothman said. “I felt really confident that anytime I threw the ball back, Branden would get the kill.”Lothman handed out 20 assists and led the team in blocks with four. Sophomore hitter DJ White and sophomore blocker Caleb Zimmick each recorded eight kills. Harvard won the first set with ease, ending on a 9-3 run to take it, 25-15.The second frame was close the entire way with nine ties in the set. To close out the stanza, Owen and White registered back-to-back kills to give the Crimson the set, 28-26.“It was a touch-and-go match,” Lothman said. “We came out really strong early, and we won the first game by a pretty wide margin…. We didn’t play great defense, but I think the offense was clicking for the entire match.”

In the final carnival of the season for nearly all members of the Harvard ski team, the Crimson submitted its fifth straight ninth-place finish out of 17 schools at the EISA Championships in Newry, Maine. Junior Rebecca Nadler, who took home Harvard skiing’s first ever individual NCAA title last winter, was the lone Crimson athlete to qualify for the this season’s national championships.Harvard accrued 378.5 points on the weekend, well behind the University of Vermont’s top score of 939.5. The Catamounts not only overcame a first-day deficit to Dartmouth, but also completed a perfect season and won their third straight EISA title.The Crimson was happy with its performances on both the alpine and Nordic sides, even if qualification for NCAA championships did not quite go according to plan.“We had four athletes with a chance at making [Nordic] NCAA championships,” Harvard Nordic coach Chris City said. “Unfortunately, none of them made it, but they all skied some of their best races of the season this final weekend.”On the first day, freshman Emily Hannah paced the Crimson with an 18th place finish in the 5K classic, and teammates Jennifer Rolfes and Alena Tofte also represented Harvard in the top 50 with 44th and 45th-place finishes, respectively.
Hannah again led the Crimson with a 13th-place finish in the 10K Freestyle MS out of a field of 72. Rolfes and freshman Annie Harvieux finished in 41st and 42nd place, separated by only four-tenths of a second.In the Men’s 10K classic, junior Chris Stock raced to a 14th place finish, followed by sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci in 39th and senior Anthony Ryerson in 41st. Maifeld-Carucci also posted a 13th-place finish in the Men’s 15K Freestyle MS, and Ryerson joined him in the top 20. Stock finished in 32nd.On the alpine side, Nadler led the way for Harvard. She took 13th place in the slalom on Sunday and tied Vermont’s Kate Ryley for first-place in the giant slalom, an event in which Nadler will look to repeat as national champion.“When the conditions are so good, everybody can put down a fantastic run,” Harvard alpine coach Tim Mitchell said.  “So there were a lot of times that were stacked very tightly together,”Mitchell also praised Nadler, who was the only Crimson skier, Nordic or alpine, to qualify for the NCAA Championships.“It’s the time of year you want to be hitting your stride, and that’s what she’s been doing,” he said. “The result was not a surprise. You can see it in her skiing and training and now the results she’s making.”Harvard’s Catherine Sheils, sophomore Liz Strong, and freshman Samantha Udolf also had top-50 finishes in both the slalom and the giant slalom.For the men, freshman Simon Merryweather led the team in both events, finishing 33rd in the slalom and 49th in the giant slalom. Senior Andrew Spielvogel and junior Ian Anderson also finished both races; Spielvogel came in 52nd in the giant slalom and 46th in the slalom, and Anderson came in 41st in the slalom after finishing 60th in the giant slalom.“It was a pretty solid overall performance—probably one of our better showings as a team,” Mitchell said. “I think people came a lot closer to executing on race day what they’d been working on in training…and I thought everybody’s second run, for the most part, was better than their first run, so they were able to make adjustments even throughout the day, which is always encouraging to see.”Both Mitchell and City are encouraged by their team’s performance this weekend, especially given program’s youth and relative inexperience.“As your college career progresses, you can improve your starting position based on your international ranking points and your previous year’s college performance,” Mitchell said. “Obviously as a freshman, it’s a bit of an uphill climb…. You can have a really great day and on the results sheet it doesn’t necessarily show up as much as their physical performance would have you believe.”From here, both the alpine and Nordic squads—with the exception of Nadler, who will prepare for the NCAA championships—will focus on non-collegiate races before winding down their seasons.“Most of our athletes will be doing a bunch of non-collegiate races to build their international ranking points,” Mitchell said. “Those will influence their start positions in college races [next year].”—Staff writer Justin C.

Despite a nine-point halftime lead, the Harvard women’s basketball team let Yale tie up the score twice in the second half before capturing the victory, 69-66, Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.Bulldog sophomore Sarah Halejian proved a tough opponent as the guard led all scorers with 29 points. In their last meeting, Harvard (15-8, 6-3 Ivy) was able to hold Halejian to just 10 points in a 67-54 win on the road.“I think it’s a lack of discipline on defense,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said of her team’s inability to contain Halejian. “Staying down on her fakes. She has a certain move—they know the scout. They didn’t play the scout when they played her.”This time out, Halejian went 12-of-15 from the field and hit all four attempts from deep.“She’s a good player,” junior Christine Clark said. “I think we could have done a better job containing her drive and keeping her in front of us. We just have to learn as a team not to let a player do that to us.”
The Crimson was paced by the guard pair of co-captain Victoria Lippert and Clark, who combined for 39 points. Lippert, who chipped in a season-high 24 points in Friday’s victory against Brown, recorded 12 of her 19 points during a second half in which the Bulldogs (10-14, 5-5) netted 40 points.Clark achieved her first double-double of the season with 20 points and 13 boards, both team-highs.“It feels great,” Clark said. “Even more than [my statistics] it’s so good to be able to sweep Yale. This again is my first year ever sweeping Yale. I love staying undefeated at home. It’s just really great to build off of this from now on.”Clark and Lippert were instrumental in the battle towards the end of the second frame when Yale knotted the score twice, first at 47-all and again at 54-all.Five shots from beyond the arc propelled the Bulldogs’ second half efforts. Yale opened the frame with an 8-0 run that brought it within four.Clark nailed four shots from the line and Lippert proved effective in the paint, with seven points of her own during the closing five minutes to seal the win.“I’ll just do whatever it takes to win, so I was really glad that we were able to pull it out tonight,” Lippert said.The Crimson jumped out to a quick start in the first half. Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle immediately grabbed a board off a missed jumper from classmate Ali Curtis and fed it back to the guard, who drilled a trey 21 seconds into the contest.A jumper from Lippert and a pair of free throws by Fagbenle gave Harvard a 7-2 lead that it would never relinquish.The Crimson squad extended its advantage to as many as 15 points with 2:32 on the clock in the opening stanza. Harvard remained aggressive on the glass, out-rebounding the Bulldogs as the team has done against almost every foe this season and converting 11 second-chance points in that opening half.

A goal that snuck in right at the buzzer in the last second of the first period gave No. 6 Clarkson (26-8-0, 18-4-0 ECAC) a 2-0 lead and put it well on its way to a 3-1 victory over No. 5 Harvard (20-5-3, 16-3-2) Saturday at Bright Hockey Center. Down two, Crimson coach Katey Stone decided to make a change in front of net. Freshman Emerance Maschmeyer was pulled out of goal to let co-captain Laura Bellamy take over for the second and third periods.“The first one she wasn’t ready.” Stone said. “It was an easy shot, [and] went right in, she didn’t track it well. When you’re already down 2-0 in the first period, and they score in that fashion with [two-tenths] of a second left on the clock, you have to make some changes. Lu came in and did a good job.”The Golden Knights’ strongest performance came from junior goalie Erica Howe. Howe faced a very aggressive Harvard offensive attack, blocking 39 of Harvard’s 40 shots on net and keeping 86 Crimson shot attempts at bay. Having little time to spend in opposing ice, Clarkson’s offense took less than half as many shot attempts, tallying 38 attempts and putting 23 shots on goal.But Clarkson managed to capitalize on its plays in the first period, while the Crimson struggled to do so. The two goals by junior forwards Carly Mercer and Vanessa Gagnon gave the Golden Knights the early lead they needed. Early in the first period, Mercer cut around sophomore Sarah Edney and netted a goal in the top left corner. Assisted by Danielle Skirrow, Gagnon capitalized on a wraparound that put the puck out in front, scoring in the last second of the period.“We’ve got to get better at getting to the net and getting to the net for those rebounds, something we were doing a real good job of earlier [this season],” Stone said.
The second period brought a definitive change in pace for Harvard.“When we gave up that goal late, we lost a little momentum,” Bellamy said. “We wanted to come out and move our feet and use our speed. That was our game plan from the start and we kind of got away from that in the first.”The team outplayed the Golden Knights in the second period, firing 18 shots on net and allowing just four Clarkson attempts. The Crimson controlled the puck in Clarkson’s zone, and its efforts paid off when freshman forward Miye O’Dench scored the team’s only goal, with freshman Dylanne Crugnale tallying the assist. O’Dench put the puck right over the goaltender’s glove to net a goal in the top left corner.Both teams struggled to capitalize on the power play with neither managing to capitalize. Clarkson successfully killed four Harvard penalties, while Harvard killed Clarkson’s five.The third period brought the Crimson’s control to an end. Clarkson reclaimed its ability to get the puck to Harvard’s net, and junior forward Jamie Lee Rattray netted Clarkson’s final goal. Rattray rebounded a shot by Gagnon for the goal.“We were getting our pockets picked a little bit tonight,” Bellamy said. “We cleaned up our game by the end, but by then to go down [makes] it tough to come back.”The Crimson’s second loss to the Golden Knights this season locked it into the third seed for the upcoming ECAC tournament. The team plans to carry the loss as a learning experience as it approaches the tournament.“We found some things out about our team today, and places we can get better,” Stone said.The loss was followed by Harvard’s Senior Day activities which celebrated the Class of 2013, which includes a number of key conributors. Bellamy recovered the team’s defensive stability, making thirteen saves, and allowing only one goal while her co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey led the team in shots on net with six, matched only by junior forward Lyndsey Fry.

In a desperate attempt to break the deadlock, the No. 5 Harvard women’s hockey team turned up the pressure, sustaining two possessions in the offensive zone in the last minute of overtime.  In the end it was not enough, as St. Lawrence forced the Crimson’s third tie of the season, 2-2.After smacking conference opponents Brown and Colgate in a pair of 5-2 affairs, Harvard’s (20-5-3, 16-3-2) Friday night matchup against the Saints (17-12-5, 12-6-4) was much tighter.“I think we are all disappointed tonight in a tie,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “But not disappointed in our effort. I think our kids played really hard.”The game got off to a chippy start with five penalties committed in the first two periods. The first period was owned by the Crimson, while the visitors acted as the aggressors for most of the second.The game eventually tightened up as a tense final 25 minutes saw few chances on either side before the game ended in a draw at the close of overtime.
Harvard came out strong, edging its opponents 12–2 in shots on net in the first. Four of those shots came from sophomore defenseman Sarah Edney.  One of which found the back of the net. The goal, which was credited to sophomore forward Hillary Crowe as it deflected off her stick, turned out to be the only puck to get past Carmen MacDonald in the opening frame.The Crimson let its opponent back in the game in the second period, committing costly penalties and failing to account for skaters in front of the net.St Lawrence’s Kelly Sabatine evened the score by wristing one into the back of the net from the faceoff circle during the side’s first power-play opportunity of the period.Kayla Raniwsky put the Saints ahead, capitalizing on a puck that bounced to Maschmeyer’s weak side. The goal came on only the fifth shot directed on net for the night.Several minutes later the puck found the back of the net again as two Harvard defenders collided and lost sight of it. Though the goal was eventually disallowed as it was slapped out of the air, it seemed as if a deflated Crimson side needed something to get them going.That something came just minutes later as senior forward Kaitlin Spurling and sophomore forward Samantha Reber raced up the ice.Spurling brought momentum back to the home side late in the second frame, directing a pass from the blue line past MacDonald. From there, Harvard kept firing, tallying the final six shots of the period.“Reber made a great drop pass to me,” Spurling said. “I just got it quickly and rifled it toward the net.”Multiple individual milestones were approached on Friday. Reber tallied a point for the third straight game, while Spurling’s three-game streak is one away from matching her career high. Over the last three games, Spurling has six points.In the third, control swayed to Harvard, but co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey, who put six shots on net, could not seal the deal as the scoreless frame preceded an overtime period.

NEW HAVEN, Conn.—It took Wesley Saunders one trip to New Haven as a starter to become national news.The sophomore forward came out firing with eight points in the first 10 minutes of Saturday’s contest, but the highlight of his night came halfway through the first period. After coming down with an offensive board, Saunders received a pass on the perimeter and drove to the basket, beating sophomore guard Armani Cotton off the dribble and flying over sophomore forward Brandon Sherrod to put the ball home.“That was sick,” sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi said. “It was unbelievable. I didn’t think at first he was going to dunk it, but he just went over the little one, and he dunked it.”The dunk—slotted at number three on that evening’s SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays—accounted for two of Saunders’s 14 points in Harvard’s (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) win over Yale (11-16, 5-5) at Payne Whitney Gym, 72-66.But after the dunk—Saunders’s second of the night—he slowed down. Despite accounting for more than a third of the Crimson’s first half points on five-of-five shooting from the paint, Saunders did not score in the final nine minutes of the period.
After failing to complete two consecutive three-point plays with nine minutes to play, Saunders was held scoreless until the start of the second half, when he hit a driving layup for his final two points of the game.Although Saunders had scoreless stretches, he contributed on the boards and finished second on the team with five rebounds. The sophomore also chipped in four assists, finishing behind only freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who had seven.INSIDE OUTSophomore forward Kenyatta Smith’s breakout weekend—34 points and 16 blocks against Penn and Princeton—earned him a starting spot, but it didn’t get him much farther.Looking to make plays in the paint at the start of the game, the Crimson fed Smith down low on its first three possessions. After the center went one-of-three and allowed two layups from Yale’s leading scorer Matt Townsend in the first three minutes, Harvard looked elsewhere for offensive output but continued to play in the post.The Crimson was held to only one three in the first half, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard’s first points of the night at the seven-minute mark.But despite going one-of-seven from deep in the first period, the traditionally strong three-point shooting team—averaging 40 percent on the season—went to the line 14 times.“There is no better offense that you can run than getting fouled all the time,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We will trade free throw opportunities for threes, and if we can get fouls from our opponent, it’s an easier shot from the foul line.”Harvard kept to its tough inside game in the second half, and the free throws it earned were crucial down the stretch. Up by three with two minutes left, the Crimson added six points from the stripe—with leading scorer Moundou-Missi accounting for four.After co-captain Christian Webster heated up from the arc and sunk three treys in the final 10 minutes, the Crimson finished the game with a 6-of-16 mark from deep.

If there’s one thing that stood out about the John J. Lee Amphitheater at Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium Saturday night, it was probably the noise.With 12:09 to play in the second half, Javier Duren knocked down a transition three-pointer to give the Bulldogs a three-point advantage, 49-46—his team’s largest lead since 6-3. He let out a scream, but it was drowned out by the roar of the Yale crowd. The voices only increased in volume after freshman point guard Siyani Chambers’ layup attempt was denied on the other end.At some point in the next minute or so—after co-captain Laurent Rivard finished two free throws on a technical—there was a shot clock violation. Not your standard, last-second-shot-you-weren’t-able-to-get-off violation. Rather, the buzzer went off as co-captain Christian Webster received a pass from the opposite side of the backcourt; the rest seemed to be lost in the racket.The Harvard men’s basketball team was eventually able to pull out the victory, 72-66, thanks in large part to a 17-point performance from sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi and double-digit scoring efforts from all four of the Crimson’s starting guards. But it didn’t come easily.Both the game and the atmosphere seemed fitting for the oldest college sports rivalry in the nation—more so than the 30-point drubbing that transpired the last time Harvard ventured to New Haven. Perhaps more so, even, than the two teams’ contest at Lavietes Pavilion three weeks ago Friday, in which the Crimson nearly blew a sizable lead before coming away with a much-needed 67-64 win.
Before this Saturday’s game ended with a Moundou-Missi behind-the-back dribble as the clock ran out, prompting Duren to swiftly untuck his shirt in what looked like frustration, there was a minute or so of mayhem.With 1:13 remaining and his team up four, Chambers drove in for a layup and was fouled by Duren in the paint—hard.With the game momentarily on hold as the officials reviewed the play, various chants dissolved into a nervous murmur. And after what seemed like a long time, Chambers hit one of the two resulting free throws, pushing his team’s advantage back up to five.Up 69-66 just 14 seconds later, Chambers worked the ball up the hardwood under full-court pressure and dished to Moundou-Missi under the basket with a threaded bounce pass. The sophomore was fouled on his layup attempt and converted on both free throws.On Yale’s ensuing possession, Duren found himself all alone beyond the arc, but his shot bounced on the far side of the rim, rattled around, and fell out. Duren’s hands automatically found their way to his hips as each pair in the student section moved to a corresponding forehead.On the inbound, Chambers pushed off of Duren, who fell to the ground, to receive the ball and was able to get it on the far side of the court, all alone. After killing a few of the game’s final 10 seconds off the clock, Duren bumped Chambers out of bounds. It’s a technical. Two Yale players physically blocked their coaching staff from storming further onto the court to confront the referees. And then, just like that, after one more Chambers make at the line, the game was over.It’s hard to put a finger on the aspect of the contest that gave it a little something extra. Was it the opportunity to know off the Ivy League’s top dog with which the Bulldogs were endowed? Of the two teams with fewer than four losses heading into Saturday night’s contest, it was ‘one down, one to go’ for Yale after the Bulldogs dropped Princeton on Feb. 9.Maybe it’s the age-old rivalry itself. As evidenced by the arrangement of the Ancient Eight banners in the rafters—they’re organized by the schools’ respective founding dates, rather than alphabetically—tradition puts Harvard and Yale in close contact with one another. It might even be the do-or-die in-conference situation for Yale’s team. After this weekend, a Princeton and/or Harvard league championship seems all but guaranteed.Maybe it was sophomore Wesley Saunders’ Sportscenter-worthy slam in the 11th minute—one of three Harvard dunks on the night.Whatever the ‘it’ factor may have been, those who tuned in, either in person or via CBS Sports, caught their fair share of excitement. The Game between Harvard and Yale football gets all the hype, but for one night in New Haven, men’s basketball reigned supreme. —Staff writer Catherine E.

Despite its many virtues, it’s impossible to imagine Paul Thomas Anderson’s “The Master” succeeding without Joaquin Phoenix’s lead performance. Even Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln” doesn’t depend as much on its titular figure as “The Master” does on Phoenix’s  freddie Quell, a sex-obsessed alcoholic and war veteran. Indeed, the majority of the film is composed of his interactions with the religious leader Lancaster Dodd, played by a strikingly charismatic Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman deserves accolades for his work here, but the film is ultimately driven by Phoenix; though Anderson has admitted “The Master” was inspired by Scientology and the life of L. Ron Hubbard, his script is less concerned with providing transparent commentary than it is with examining how Quell reacts to Dodd and his promises.All this means it’s left to Phoenix to show the audience how a troubled soul might approach the prospect of salvation. The answer is not spelled out in Anderson’s elusive, elliptical script; instead, the viewer will have to search for an answer in the way a sullen Phoenix erupts into sudden violence, in the way he hops onto a motorcycle and drives into the distance, in the way his lopsided face turns a sneer into a grimace. Phoenix has stated that he doesn’t care about the Oscars, and he shouldn’t. Even without the prize, this performance is an enduring testament to his singular talent.—Staff writer Petey E.

The Best Adapted Screenplay award is always a challenging choice; on the one hand, the screenplay is the creative inspiration behind the movie. On the other, the screenplay is transformed as it goes from text to action, so much so that it can be difficult to distinguish the delivery of a talented actor or actress from the strength or weakness of the film’s written backbone.The nominees for Best Adapted Screenplay run the gamut from the surreal adventure “Life of Pi,” written by David Magee, to the subversive romcom “Silver Linings Playbook,” adapted by director David O. Russell. Yet the winner should be “Lincoln,” adapted by Tony Kushner from Doris Kearns Goodwin’s political biography “A Team of Rivals.” Kushner’s script turns the dry and bureaucratic ratification of the 13th Amendment into a compelling and human drama, one which touches on grandeur but avoids an excess of moralizing and pomp. Kushner’s Lincoln is a figure the president rarely seems in history books—an uncertain, flawed, and deeply human man.—Staff writer Ola Topczewska can be reached at atopczewska@college.harvard.edu.

I’ll say what everyone’s been saying: Tarantino and Affleck got robbed. Both directors are more deserving than my choice of the nominees, Ang Lee for “Life of Pi,” but I’ll work with what I have.Lee deserves to win for transforming Yann Martel’s overrated, heavy-handed novel into an impeccably crafted visual masterpiece. The obvious Oscar parallel here is James Cameron in 2009—neither “Avatar” nor “Life of Pi” have inherently compelling or original plots, which means that it is that much more important to engross the viewer with innovative images and effects. Cameron succeeded in bringing the planet Pandora to life on a grand scale, and the scenes from “Pi” on the Pacific Ocean are similarly awe-inspiring. Both movies are also two rare examples for which 3D enhanced the experience rather than detracting from it, and a lot of credit goes to the directors for that.“Life of Pi” isn’t one of the year’s best movies, and it isn’t one of Lee’s best movies either. However, Lee had the trickiest task of any of this year’s nominees, and he pulled it off with pizzazz.—Staff writer Will Holub-Moorman can be reached at holubmoorman@college.harvard.edu.

This category features both its youngest nominee ever—Quvenzhané Wallis, 9, for “Beasts of the Southern Wild”—and its oldest—Emmanuelle Riva, 85, for “Amour.” But different generations aside, the category is a smorgasbord of talents from some of 2012’s most interesting films.It certainly seems a closer field than Best Actor, where critics have chalked up Daniel Day-Lewis since the first photos of him wearing Lincoln’s iconic beard appeared. Wallis’s turn as Hushpuppy was good, as was Naomi Watts’s bravely committed performance in “The Impossible,” but it seemed like both of them were ultimately subservient to the worlds the directors constructed—they didn’t command their respective films. Equally, while it was much praised, Jessica Chastain’s performance in “Zero Dark Thirty” lacked inner life—there was little sense of her character as a human being. Perhaps that helped the film overall, but it does her no favors here.Between Riva’s performance and Jennifer Lawrence’s wonderful work in “Silver Linings Playbook” then, I would plump for the latter. Although Riva was extraordinarily courageous, and the luminous beauty of her “Hiroshima Mon Amour” days seems remarkably undimmed, Lawrence gave us a deeply complex creation by turns melancholy, defiant, and bursting unsentimentally with life. She deserves to win this prize. Also deserving of a mention is Marion Cotillard, arguably just as good, and shockingly passed over for the magisterial “Rust and Bone.”—Staff writer Caleb J.T.

If you think Anne Hathaway’s got this in the bag, think again. Sure, she shed about 25 pounds to play the tragic heroine in “Les Misérables,” and as everyone knows, the bigger the weight gain or loss, the better the Oscar chances. Yes, she shaved her head and let out a fountain of tears in her no-holds-barred performance of “I Dreamed A Dream.” And she is, admittedly, one of the few singers in “Les Mis” who doesn’t induce cringing.Perhaps her melodramatic camera-hogging will bring home the gold. But that doesn’t mean it should. For all its apparent one-sidedness, this category actually has one of the strongest lineups of this year. Veteran Sally Field deftly gave us both sides of Lincoln’s first lady, Helen Hunt showed sensitivity—and more—as a sex surrogate in “The Sessions,” and Amy Adams once again demonstrated her adaptability as the icy wife in “The Master.” But hiding among these heavyweights is the truly deserving winner: the timid, loving mother in “Silver Linings Playbook.” As Dolores Solitano, Jacki Weaver both nails a Philly accent and portrays a mother holding a disintegrating family together with sheer resolve—not easy when that family includes a bipolar Bradley Cooper and an obsessive-compulsive Robert De Niro—all while whipping up the best crabby snacks and homemades a family could want.—Staff writer Tree A.

 Richard Brody recently published an <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2013/01/michael-hanekes-amour-reviewed-by-richard-brody.html"">eloquent and well-reasoned piece in his Front Row column in The New Yorker on Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or-winning and Oscar Best Picture-nominated film ""Amour."" In the article, Brody discussed its ""sterility"" and how the ""smirking pleasure"" exhibited by its filmmaker at the film's (spoiler alert) climactic murder scene made it feel ""repellent."" Haneke's game, as it always has been, is to make the audience complicit in whatever heinous act he chooses to depict onscreen, in this case the euthanasia of someone in extreme pain.Brody is correct to identify this characteristic, which a lot of more positive reviews missed—or chose to ignore—but he confuses it for a weakness. More erroneous are those who have suggested that ""Amour"" represents Haneke softening, becoming more humanistic in his old age. Far from it—as Brody notes, his gaze is chillier and more grimly fixed than ever. This is evinced not only by the movie's rigid frames and lengthy takes—the camera never cuts away to spare us distress—but also by the film's representation of the dying process as the ultimate in body horror: pain, dementia, incontinence, and the foul stink of a decaying corpse.<!--more-->The overwhelming sense in ""Amour"" is one of entrapment. The elderly Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) suffers a stroke and swiftly deteriorates in front of her husband's eyes. She's a spirit trapped in a collapsing body, and the sentimentalist view of the film might see Georges's (Jean-Louis Trintignant) eventual smothering of her as the ultimate act of that love for which the picture is titled. He releases her from this prison just as he, earlier in the film, releases a dove that wanders accidentally into their Parisian apartment.But this is where Haneke muddies the waters. Georges is equally trapped—within the imprisoning walls of the apartment from which, with one exception at the beginning, the action never leaves. He has nightmares, the burden of caring for Anne becomes his only activity, and he starts to shut out acquaintances and friends—even the couple's daughter. Speaking at the Golden Globe Foreign Language Film Symposium on Jan. 12, Haneke described Trintignant as having ""a secretiveness to him, a mystery."" He's right—Georges's face gives no clues as to the true nature of his motives, and it lends that final killing an air of terrible ambiguity. Is Georges freeing his wife as much as he is freeing himself?
The viewer might find this idea unpalatable—indeed, perhaps they should find it unpalatable—but so it goes with a director who <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/nov/04/michael-haneke-amour-director-interview"">once claimed his aim was to ""rape the viewer into independence."" Our complicity with Georges, if Brody is right in identifying it, appears to suggest that Haneke has succeeded. Whether or not this is grounds to actually dislike the film or simply the issues it confronts is a matter of personal taste, but don't think for a second that Haneke has mediated his modus operandi or stark vision of the universe. Pushed to the edge of life as it is in ""Amour,"" love, too, eventually perishes.

To fully disclose my bias, I felt emotionally castrated when the media rebranded “Zero Dark Thirty” from “highly anticipated Osama bin Laden movie” to “amoral cesspool.” The pain feels especially raw considering oddsmakers, all of the news outlets, and <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/20/ben-zauzmer-oscar-guru-2013/"">Harvard’s own Ben T. Zauzmer ’15 have gone into conclave to choose “Argo” as the name of the Academy’s first-born son (or 85th-born). However, it is truly “Zero Dark Thirty” that should storm the stage of the Kodak Theater, for Kathryn Bigelow has erected a thunderous, titanic monument to obsession: Jessica Chastain’s Maya, steely gazed and fully sprung, Athena-style, from the director’s vision. Jealous ex-husband James Cameron looks on.If it ends in naught for “Argo,” then it will be “Lincoln” that succeeds; however, the distilling nature of the prediction system also ends in simplified damnation—“Django Unchained” is too controversial, “Les Misérables” is too corny, and “Zero Dark Thirty” could be renamed “Torture: Apply Directly to the Foreskin.” At 8:30 Sunday, it will be a funeral march for Tarantino’s Siegfried, empty chairs at empty tables for the “Argo” contingent as they thank the Academy onstage, and pursed lips for the Bigelow Squad. But even though the Best Picture win is pure politics, the nominees themselves all deserve your time—especially “Zero Dark Thirty.”—Staff writer Christine A.

It is a film that leaves its audience with more questions than it answers. In doing so it becomes more than a source of entertainment, and instead evolves into a vehicle for social commentary.Boal won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 2010 for “The Hurt Locker,” and he has once again crafted a strong script.—Staff writer Ola Topczewska can be reached at atopczewska@college.harvard.edu.

On senior night at Clarkson, it was the Harvard men’s hockey team’s freshmen that stole the show.Rookie forwards Greg Gozzo and Kyle Criscuolo each had two goals, classmate Brayden Jaw had one score, freshmen Brian Hart and Jimmy Vesey both had two assists, and fellow newcomer Peter Traber made 29 saves to spark the Crimson to a 6-2 win over Clarkson.Though Harvard (8-16-3, 5-13-2 ECAC) has struggled throughout the season and seems all but destined to finish last in the conference for the first time in ECAC history, the victory over the Golden Knights (9-16-7, 8-9-3) points towards a brighter future ahead for a squad that has struggled of late to turn highly-regarded recruiting classes into wins.It was also a night Gozzo and Jaw will never forget, as each recorded his first career tally in the contest.“I thought it was a really good team effort,” Traber said. “It was very good for our class.... It was good for [Gozzo] to get his first goal, and Brayden too. Both were very nice first goals, so it was nice to see.”
Clarkson got on the board first just 5:23 into the contest when Ben Sexton scored on the power play after his shot bounced off of a Harvard defender’s skate.But two minutes later, following a tripping penalty on the Golden Knights’ Alex Boak, Harvard got its own man-up opportunity, and the Crimson took advantage. Vesey sent a cross-ice pass inside to Hart, and Clarkson goaltender Greg Lewis slid over to the right side of the net in anticipation of a Hart shot. But the rookie instead sent the puck to Criscuolo on the left side, giving the forward an open look from which to put it home.It was just the 13th man-up goal of the season for Harvard, which is third worst in the nation in power-play percentage. The Crimson led the country in that category a year ago.“[Vesey] threw a nice pass through their defenders to Brian Hart on the goal line, and Hart found me back-door wide open,” Criscuolo said. “It was a great play by those guys, and it was good to get a power-play goal, because we were pretty due for one.”Just over a minute later, the two freshmen were back at it again when Criscuolo took a pass inside from Hart, attacked the net head-on, and fired a shot past Lewis to put Harvard ahead before finishing with a big fist pump.“It was a two-on-one,” Criscuolo said. “[Marshall] Everson kind of drove his defender back and gave me a lane to shoot. I was just trying to get it on net and luckily I beat [Lewis] glove side.”With just 24 seconds remaining in the period, Gozzo took a pass from assistant captain forward Alex Fallstrom and put Harvard up, 3-1, with the first of his two goals.“We just wanted to get on the board and start attacking their D because we knew they could turn some pucks over,” Criscuolo said. “Once we started getting pucks to the net, we realized their goalie was having an off night.”Clarkson outshot the Crimson, 15-3, in the second period. Traber held his ground until there was just 1:29 remaining in the frame, when, following a Crimson turnover, Simon Bessette was able to fire a shot past him to cut Harvard’s lead to one.But Harvard put the contest away in the final frame. Senior forward Connor Morrison made it a 4-2 game at the 6:41 mark when he took a long pass from sophomore Tommy O’Regan, beat his defender, and fired a shot off the far post that deflected into the net.

Stop by one of the general meetings of the Harvard College Voice Actors’ Guild and you’re sure to be bombarded by myriad accents from across the world. When chatting with just one member of the group, you might find yourself listening first to a British accent, next to a Southern drawl, and finally to an impression of a famous actor or cartoon character, interspersed with laser gun sounds—all in the course of a brief conversation.The Voice Actors’ Guild, which seeks to promote the art of voice acting for radio and film, began in the hallowed halls of Annenberg, where the club’s current president, Taylor A. Cressler ’14, and a couple of friends would often meet for dinner during their freshman year to practice different accents. “We realized that there was no place on campus where you can learn how to do accents or do any sort of simple voice acting,” Cressler says. “It’s all stage and film acting.” Cressler’s efforts to fill that gap in the acting community met with success in early 2012, when the club received official recognition from the College.For the first year of its existence, the Voice Actors’ Guild focused mainly on hosting accent workshops. Now the club is branching out to include a wider variety of projects, ranging from a voice-only production of George Bernard Shaw’s “Arms and the Man” to a re-recording of a Flash Gordon radio series from the 1930s. Teis D. Jorgensen ’14 is directing a third project—a play entitled “Conversations” that features improvisation. The play starts off with a brief, scripted dialogue between two characters, but then moves into an improvised conversation. “After the beginning, the script fades out and the actors improv and use their voices to develop the conflict, their relationship to one another, and the resolution,” Jorgensen says. None of the projects have a set release date, but the group hopes to complete all three by the end of the semester.Although similar to stage and film acting, voice acting has its own unique challenges, Cressler says. Voice actors rely on speech alone, so they have to devise ways to convey their meaning without physical acting or facial expression. “People don’t realize it going through everyday life, but body language is a huge part of communication,” Cressler says. “If you take that away, you really have to overcompensate for any lost meaning.” Jorgensen argues that making stories come to life for the listening audience without the use of props and costumes is the greatest challenge voice actors face. In a voice-only play, actors must establish a setting and flesh out their characters using only their voice and, perhaps, additional sound effects.While voice acting is just a hobby for many of the club’s members, for others participation in the Voice Actors’ Guild is a stepping stone to a potential future career. Cressler hopes to pursue a career in acting after college and recognizes that being an experienced voice actor has advantages when auditioning for roles in the future. “If you can master a good voice, then it’s a lot easier to get both voice-acting roles and movie roles,” Cressler says.
Alexander J. Iascone ’16, another hopeful future actor and member of the Voice Actor’s Guild, agrees. “When you’re auditioning for a role, anything you can do to make the director see you more as the character is helpful,” he says. “If the character is from a certain area and you’ve mastered that accent, then you’ll be better suited for the role.”Jorgensen, who does not plan to pursue a career in acting after graduating, acknowledges that he has learned many interpersonal skills from his experiences voice acting and directing voice-acting projects. Learning to convey intent and emotion through speech helps him interact in new settings.There are other perks to being in the Voice Actors’ Guild, according to Iascone. “I can impress girls with all my different accents,” he says, laughing.

Student activists and union members have led recent <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/6/huctw-protests-continue-university/"">protests in support of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents 4,600 employees, during the longest contract negotiations between the University and HUCTW in history. Among the negotiation’s most contentious issues is a disagreement over wage increases. While HUCTW portrays the University’s current offer as unjust, Harvard’s proposed salary increases, well above local inflation, are both fair and reasonable.With an <a href=""http://www.huctw.org/negotiations/2012/huctw_harvard_finance_factsheet.pdf"">average salary of $50,000 as of 2011 and wage increases consistently beating local inflation, HUCTW workers are paid well above competitive market rates—average compensation is at the 75th <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/10/update-on-labor-talks/"">percentile for the industry. The University’s three-year offer for a salary increase of 2.8 percent in the first year, 2.5 percent in the second, and two percent in the third are fair in comparison to the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of a <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ro1/cpibos.pdf"">1.7 percent inflation rate for the Boston area. Perhaps the University’s offer is not luxurious, but it is certainly not exploitative.Compared to the rest of the country, where hourly pay has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sunday-review/americas-productivity-climbs-but-wages-stagnate.html"">stagnated since 2000 when adjusted for inflation, HUCTW workers have fared much better even when compared with cost of living increases in the Boston area. From 2002-2011, based on data on HUCTW’s website and BLS statistics, real wages for HUCTW members have increased 13.7 percent. While this increase might be viewed as modest, union leaders cannot in good faith claim that the University has treated the union unfairly.Admittedly, HUCTW’s actions are understandable—it is, after all, the role of a labor union to advocate for the best possible outcome for its members. But to a dispassionate observer, the union’s rejection of Harvard’s reasonable offer seems a fallacious dramatization of the contract negotiations as something of a Dickensian dispute between a rich university and its mistreated workers.The most troubling and pernicious assertions made by some are the insinuations that the University’s large endowment and recent expansions make it somehow obligated to agree to hefty wage increases. To the contrary, the University’s endowment exists to allocate funds towards programs—like the investment in EdX or campus renovations—that advance the priorities and educational mission of Harvard most effectively. To say that the University’s endowment makes it liable to increase its already fair contract offer is to ignore the realities of the job market, where compensation is based on the value of a job in the marketplace rather than institutional wealth.
We hope that HUCTW members will urge their leaders to bring a swift end to the protracted contract negotiations. Ending this prolonged fight is in the interest of HUCTW, the University, and the students whom they both seek to serve.

As many in the Harvard community know, the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers,  representing 4,600 skilled office and laboratory staff, have been in protracted negotiations over pay and benefits since March 2012.During the course of negotiations, management negotiators have <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/30/huctw-contract-negotiations/"">stated that their salary increase offers are “consistent with the job markets.” This prompts the logical question: If that’s the case, why has there not yet been an agreement?Although it may be true that the University’s pay proposals are consistent with current market trends, that does not mean that those proposals can sustain the lives of the hard-working staff. Like the rest of the country, Harvard’s middle class workforce has taken a huge hit over the last few years due to constrained wage growth and other effects of the economic recession. We have been struggling to pay bills and hold on to homes—some have not succeeded. These excerpts from union members’ letters to Harvard administrators illustrate this unfortunate direction:“The 2010 salary increase meant 19 dollars a week before taxes. As a single mother of four, that doesn’t even cover bus fare for the week. When my children aren’t feeling well, I’ve found myself wondering, ‘Does he/she really need to see the doctor?’ Sometimes I am choosing between groceries and co-pays.”“Our rent went up by $100 a month. I have had to decide between using my dwindling savings or not paying a bill so that my family could buy food for another week. We don’t ever buy meat. My wife and I live on the bare edge as we work with a credit consolidation company to pay off our debt. It almost brings me to tears to write this. My daughter wants to take swim lessons—not an unreasonable request—but we can’t afford it.”
“We have sold pretty much everything of value to keep up with the mortgage payments. As a mother, I want to be able to do more. Maybe buy a ticket to a museum or some clothes that didn’t come from a second-hand store. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed them, and I’m just not used to that.”Any thoughtful Harvard citizen has to ask, is this the philosophy or the business model on which the University’s greatness is founded? Do administrative leaders believe we should organize the institution around a goal of capitalizing on destructive trends in a wage-depressed job market? When a staff member is worried about whether she can pay for groceries, is she likely to do her best work? Is this the way to build a skillful, committed staff, working hand-in-hand with Harvard faculty and students every day?Of course, union members understand that the crisis didn’t only batter members’ family finances—it hit University finances as well. Harvard’s endowment lost a substantial amount of value in 2008-2009. But one of the primary ways the University cut spending in 2009 was to reduce staffing without diminishing the amount of work. Staff members (union and non-union) have been doing the jobs of departed colleagues on top of their own work for more than <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/6/23/harvard-announces-impending-layoffs-harvard-announced/"">three years . Members have found creative ways to do more with less, as well as working countless hours of uncompensated extra time, in an effort at good citizenship. Yet now, as the endowment has recovered much of its value and the University returns to bold investment in new projects, Harvard seems frustratingly reluctant to recognize the efforts of the staff.One union member writes, “Harvard staff are some of the most skilled and talented administrative workers in the Boston area. We choose to bring our talents to Harvard because we love what we do here—but we also choose to be at Harvard because the total compensation package meets our needs. Support staff members deserve the dignity of being able to maintain a middle-class lifestyle throughout their careers here.”HUCTW members understand administrators’ concerns about financial instability. For this reason, we’ve put forward proposals that tie raises to inflation, so that if the economy gets worse, Harvard’s financial obligation to staff will be smaller. Our health care proposals are cost-neutral for the University, and we have suggested curve-bending ideas that would reduce health expenses for Harvard and for all employees. We consider administrators’ concerns about economic uncertainty to be shared concerns. We need for management negotiators to look on the Union’s pay and benefit proposals with that same spirit of mutuality.A mutually supportive community, in which Harvard takes care of its staff and the staff takes care of Harvard, is critical. Real wage growth will prevent the problems of poverty from seeping further into our workforce. Affordable health care for employees at all levels is essential to preserve a middle class standard of living. But a balanced, progressive bargain is also critical for the future of Harvard. A great University needs a great staff.  Harvard administrators should show that they appreciate our skillful contribution and commitment by settling our contract fairly now.Carrie Barbash and Bill Jaeger are organizers with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.

As I puzzled over my college decision in April 2010, an interviewer from a smaller, quainter institution than Harvard sent me a detailed message, enumerating the reasons why not to go Crimson. For starters, life on the Charles was just too damned crowded, with eager undergrads swept to the wayside as the University doted on law, business, and medical students. Classes were oversized and understaffed. And if one could believe it, Harvard students were just as deprived outside the classroom—parties were anathema, and there was nary a Gothic steeple to be found.Unimpressed by the Princeton representative’s hokum and unconcerned about the absence of Gothic towers, I chose Harvard and haven’t regretted it for a moment. Contra Harvard haters, the last five semesters have graced me with generous financial assistance, faculty friendships, one- and three-student classes, and my share of unforgettable college nights.However, there’s a grain of truth at the heart of the anti-Harvard polemicist’s argument when it comes to the finishing touches. That is to say, as much as I enjoy the elegant neo-Georgian snowfall proceeding outside my window, the University’s lack of attention to good campus grooming will come back into relief when the sun comes out in melting force. While Harvard’s aesthetic charm—rendered in colonial brick, river-spanning bridges, and breezy courtyards—needs no introduction, our beautiful campus is pockmarked with both landscaping mistakes and architectural abominations. As the University gears up for a billion-dollar House renewal campaign, it must seize the opportunity to put things right—for the sake of its students’ happiness and its legacy of good taste.No matter how much we’ve gotten accustomed to it, the elephant in the room continues to prattle noisily away. Every time we loop around Allston on our way back to school across the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, we’re arrested amidst the bricks and the bell towers: first by Pyongyang-worthy Mather, then the sci-fi clunkiness of the Leverett towers, the cinderblock hell of New Quincy, and finally the titanic brutalism of the block-long Holyoke Center. Venturing farther inland, the pulsing heart of campus is sclerotized with such architectural abortions as Canaday Hall, William James Hall, and the somewhat more defensible Science Center.Worst of all, however, are the cracked asphalt walkways that menace both our House courtyards and Harvard Yard, the historic center of our campus tradition. No matter the difference a new coat of black shine makes, the administration’s shortsighted fetish for tarmac stands aptly for a university that believes its appeal has transcended aesthetics entirely. With the reintroduction of early action to its admissions policy, Harvard College faces a yield rate of approximately 80 percent—unparalleled among peer institutions—reducing its immediate incentives to dazzle prospective students. The difference is stark: as Winthrop courtyard cracks with neglect, other elite universities lay their walkways with brick, stone, and all manner of pavers in a feverish attempt to upstage Harvard’s incomparable 377-year-old brand. It is a great shame to see Harvard students return from New Haven, Princeton, or Allston in awe of the cumulative effects of superior landscaping and paving: With over $30 billion at our disposal, we can certainly do better.
In the 1930s, the University demonstrated exceptional taste and clarity in deciding to build the upperclassman House system along the lines of Harvard’s pre-existing neo-Georgian tradition. Call it monotonous, but unlike most of the Northeast’s medieval European copycat campuses, it can be said that Harvard has a style of its own—part and parcel of the American tradition, well integrated into its Cambridge surroundings, and puritanically modest in the tradition of its founders.Attempts to modernize the Harvard aesthetic have categorically failed. Rather unlike the calculated brutalism of Georgetown’s Lauinger Library or the desert minimalism of Yale’s Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, our mid-century architectural additions continue to feel tentative, their carpeted floors and poured-concrete walls considered only in terms of trade-offs: unmitigated ugliness in exchange for elevators, bigger rooms, and more parties.As a Winthropian, I’ve been told, I have no right to judge: Critics assail my House for being roach-infested, cramped, and poorly-maintained. Fair, I respond. However, current plans for House renewal seem well positioned to address these problems—while failing to account for the fact that regardless of internal conditions, the Harvard we return to as alumni will remain blighted by the mistakes of a few nihilistic architects of the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s.If there is anything we’ve learned since, it is that taste is a bounded matter: Styles might very well change over the years, but there exists an objective pale that we ought never to cross. For the sake of Harvard’s durability as an American icon and competitiveness as a contemporary brand, let’s not be afraid to call for an erasure of our campus’ architectural mistakes while we still have a chance. If the administration wants to make a truly worthwhile investment out of House renewal, it would be wise to go all the way: Bring out the wrecking balls, and beautify Harvard.Joshua B.

Nearly two years ago, I sat in Sanders Theater for the first time, surrounded by future freshmen, and listened to President Drew G. Faust address the potential class of 2015. In her speech she talked a lot about different aspects of Harvard and Harvard life, but one story stuck out. In response to a parent’s question about the lack of vocational education at Harvard, Faust told us about a recent Slavic languages graduate who finished at Harvard as one of the world’s leading minds in the field. She then went on to explain that he was currently in medical school and planned to become a surgeon. Clearly, at Harvard you could concentrate in anything and leave being able to do anything you wanted.Most of my experience at Harvard has only reinforced this. My roommate is a Romance languages and literatures concentrator who plans to go into public policy. Another friend is a joint math and English concentrator. However, there seems to be an exception to the anti-vocational oasis that is Harvard. Where does the most notoriously vocational concentration, engineering sciences, fall in the surrounding ocean of liberal arts concentrations?The answer is that it doesn’t. It simply can’t. When a student graduates from most concentrations, he or she is an educated individual ready to learn how to be successful in any career. When a student graduates with a Bachelor of Science in engineering, he or she is a qualified engineer. Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences <a href=""http://www.seas.harvard.edu/audiences/prospective-undergraduates"">preaches to prospective undergraduates that students can “enjoy the intellectual energy of a liberal arts college where they can engage in scholarship spanning the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities” and pursue an engineering degree. However, in the introductory meeting of this spring’s sophomore engineering forum, recently declared concentrators such as myself were told that we had to “make choices” and that we couldn’t expect to concentrate in engineering and also pursue a secondary field, study abroad, and write theses.For students like Stephanie R. Warner ’15, who chose Harvard because she “wanted [her] undergraduate experience to be one that was truly interdisciplinary,” or Rishi Goel ’15, who said he transferred from the University of Texas to Harvard because he was “not just getting an education for [his] career; [but rather] getting an education for [his] life,” this statement came as quite a shock.I too am tempted to rail against this statement and demand that Harvard engineering live up to its promise of a liberal arts education. However, such a demand would be unreasonable. In its current state, it is impossible for Harvard engineering to also offer a true liberal arts education, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
To earn a Bachelor of Science in engineering sciences, one must take between 20 and 24 half-courses. The unaccredited Bachelor of Arts degree in engineering, at 14-16 half-courses, still requires more than most Harvard concentrations. It is barely possible to have what could be considered a liberal arts education within the S.B. program.Sophomore Leah P. Gaffney ’15 will graduate with an S.B. in biomedical engineering and a secondary field in global health and health policy in four years, but only because “[she] came in knowing that [she] was interested in engineering and with a math background through multivariable [calculus].” For most others, like alumna Sarah Campbell ’12, wanting a Harvard liberal arts experience meant giving up the validity of an S.B. degree and “choosing the A.B. track because it allowed for [her] to pursue a secondary and/or citation.”During sophomore fall, I faced a similar decision between pursing an accredited and more legitimate S.B. degree or an A.B. degree—three years without a single elective as opposed to a path where I could take other Harvard classes and potentially study abroad but would forfeit my ability to work as an engineer without significant make-up work in graduate school.Harvard is consistently <a href=""http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/harvard-university-2155"">ranked first in the U.S. News and World Report’s best universities. But in 2012, Harvard engineering <a href=""http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/harvard-university-02076"">ranked 19th among undergraduate engineering programs, falling well below Ivy competitors such as Cornell and Princeton, at <a href=""http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate"">eighth and 10th, respectively, and MIT and Stanford, <a href=""http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate"">ranked first and second.  Despite the discrepancies in rankings, prospective engineers are picking Harvard. In just five years, Harvard number of Harvard engineering concentrators has <a href=""http://alumni.harvard.edu/volunteer-news/engineering-applied-sciences"">doubled in size, testifying that engineering students are increasingly seeking the balanced education Harvard promises. Yet a balanced engineering education does not exist in the form promised.Harvard is one of very few institutions that attempts to make a liberal arts engineering degree a viable option, but it hasn’t quite succeeded in doing so.  As long as engineering concentrators have to make choices between becoming an accredited engineer versus pursuing a secondary or studying abroad, we cannot truly become liberal arts engineers.In the current system, this is impossible, but change is possible. Perhaps it means that Harvard needs to let engineers stay for five years or accept AP or IB math and physics credits to give engineers a head start on their requirements. Harvard’s engineering program is close to becoming the liberal arts oasis it promises to be—I urge the College and SEAS to push for changes that permit every Harvard student to pursue both engineering legitimacy and liberal arts breadth.Tessa A.C.

Dining halls were adorned with yellow and green tablecloths and filled with students enjoying avocado and salsa during Harvard University Dining Services’ Brazilian barbecue Sunday. HUDS provided the creative brunch in response to a fall survey, in which students chose Brazilian as the theme for the annual festive spring meal.The selection of Brazilian food included roast beef, marinated grilled chicken breast, chorizo and cilantro omelet, vegetarian feijoada, and Brazilian banana cake.Several students said they enjoyed the authentic feel of the cuisine. Zachary R. Berger ’15 and Jonathan Ludmir ’16, both from Miami, Fla., said the barbecue items reminded them of home.“It’s exactly like eating from these Brazilian steakhouses,” Berger said. “I wouldn’t know the difference.”Hayley H. Arader ’16, who called herself an expert on South American cuisine, also deemed the food “authentic.”
“I like Brazilian food a lot,” she said. “The bananas chips were really good. I was happy about [the meal].”Students, used to typical winter HUDS fare, said they appreciated the temporary but extensive change in cuisine.Yinka A. Akintujoye ’16 said that ethnic-themed meals are more “fun” than individual dishes “like random Korean barbecue” sporadically served by the dining halls.Akintujoye said she thought that the food was good overall, but that some of the elements of the food fest seemed “unnecessary.”“I feel like the staff probably didn’t want to be walking around dressed up in pseudo Brazilian garb,” she said, referencing the hats donned by the dining hall workers in honor of the event.Along with the Brazilian food, Cabot and Pforzheimer Houses provided an additional surprise for their students. The two houses treated students to a capoeira  performance by Contra-Mestre Chuvisquinho, leader of Sinha Capoeira Dance School in Boston, and four of his students. Capoeira is a form of martial arts originating from Brazil which incorporates elements of dance and music.“Brazil is a country that draws a lot of people to its culture through food and dancing,” said Chuvisquinho. “When a university opens the door for our culture, it’s exciting.”The demonstration was received enthusiastically  by the surprised students.“The performance was really cool. I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Rachel Park ’15 said.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

Part I of a two-part series examining how the looming cuts in federal funding could impact research at Harvard. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/26/university-tackles-funding-cuts/"">Part II ran on Feb. 26.Without a deal to avert unprecedented federal spending cuts scheduled to take effect Friday, research institutions including Harvard could be days away from the most damaging reduction of research funding in recent memory.The cuts—projected to be $85 billion from the federal balance sheets this fiscal year alone—are as unparalleled in scope as the problem, a $900 billion yearly federal deficit that Congress has forced itself to plug. As lawmakers warn of the threat such a deficit poses to federal government’s financial integrity, researchers and administrators at Harvard warn that what they call indiscriminate and poorly timed cuts could jeopardize the flow of new scientific ideas and those who generate them at a time when the economy stands to benefit from them more than ever.In total, the automatic cuts to all federal programs, better known as sequestration, are slated to progressively trim $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. After years of flat funding and increased demand for federal sponsorship, the University’s researchers, investigators, and administrators say the cuts, if enacted, will cast a long shadow over research at Harvard, where individual labs from the Medical School to the Faculty of Art and Sciences received approximately $650 million in federal monies during the 2012 fiscal year.Some agencies have already reduced grant totals in advance of the cuts, forcing labs across the University to proactively trim costs and refocus their research. At the same time, administrators have begun the process of reorienting the way the University solicits funding.
“The bottom line for us is that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what will happen if sequestration goes into effect,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in an interview last week. “We expect regardless of whether Congress averts the fiscal cliff or not, that there will be serious long-term cuts in research spending, in real terms and in nominal terms.”DANGLING OVER THE CLIFFLawmakers originally passed sequestration into law as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 in an effort to force themselves to address the growing debt by the end of 2012. Though <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/3/sequestration-fiscal-deal-spending/"">a last-minute tax deal on January 1 temporarily postponed that deadline until March 1, the effect of the sequester will be much the same: across-the-board cuts to federal programs from Medicare to the Department of Defense.Given that academic institutions like Harvard currently depend on the federal government for approximately 60 percent of funding for research and development, the threat of sequestration looms large.The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, the two largest sources of research funding for Harvard investigators, could each face immediate cuts of 5 percent, the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars in the first year alone. The United States Department of Defense, the third largest University funding source, could experience cuts of 7 percent.While 16 percent of the University’s overall operating revenue during the 2012 fiscal year came from federal sponsorship, certain schools like the School of Public Health, the Medical School, and various departments of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, rely more heavily on federal funds. University leaders have actively taken steps to lobby in Washington and administrators on campus representing each school are looking to shore up the funding they do have and explore new sources of funding from the private sector.Dean of the School of Public Health Julio Frenk said these blunt cuts could jeopardize the continuity and robustness of scientific research.“Health research cannot be turned on or off by a spigot,” he said.Fifty-five percent of the School of Public Health’s operating budget in FY 2012 came from government sponsorship, more than any other school at Harvard.Immediately behind the School of Public Health, the Medical School drew 34 percent of its operating budget last year from federal funding, primarily from the NIH and NSF.

Analyzing life expectancy data from over 101,000 people in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Harvard School of Public Health professor Till W. Bärnighausen and his coworkers have documented one of the largest increases in a region’s life expectancy in history. Their findings were reported in the scholarly journal “Science” and published online last Friday.The researchers found that life expectancy in the KwaZulu-Natal area has risen steeply, from 49.2 years in 2004 to 60.5 years in 2011. Those years span the period when antiretroviral therapy, a program of treatment also known as ART that is targeted at suppressing the progression of the human immunodeficiency virus, became available through public clinics in the region following a period of at least three years when life expectancy had been steadily falling.Bärnighausen, an associate professor of Global Health at the School of Public Health, said the only other times when researchers have “observed such rapid increases [in life expectancy] were after the influenza epidemic of 1918 or when the plague disappeared in Europe.”In 2003, the South African region had a 22 percent rate of HIV infection among its inhabitants, which Bärnighausen called “already extremely high.” But from 2003 to 2011, the portion of infected individuals rose to 30 percent.“It’s good news that the prevalence is increasing,” said Bärnighausen, because even though there are more carriers of the virus, the higher rate of infection implies that “people who are HIV infected are now living longer.”
As the length of life increases in one age group, he said, the percentage of people who are infected with HIV also grows.Bärnighausen said he thinks this study could have important political implications on the funding for HIV relief throughout all of Sub-Saharan Africa, where countries like Swaziland and Lesotho have national HIV infection rates of above 20 percent.“Such evidence is valuable because it is proof that these efforts are having the impact that we couldn’t have hoped they would have,” Bärnighausen said. “Its one of the most worthwhile investments we can make in health at this point in time.”

The Harvard Law Review will more than double the number of editors focusing on online content for the publication next year in an effort to expand its web presence.Increasing the online staff from two to five, these new editors will join the Forum Committee, which is responsible for developing the website and editing the material published online. In the next year, the Law Review hopes to enhance the functionality and design of its website in addition to increasing the quantity of published content, according to second-year Law School student Gillian S. Grossman ’10, the recently elected president who will lead 127th Volume of the organization.“The new leaders dedicated a lot of effort to expanding our online presence, and they have some creative ideas about how they are going to do that,” said Conor S. Tochilin ’06, outgoing president of the Law Review.The majority of returning editors voted to add two additional students to this year’s pool of rising editors in order to expand the online content while maintaining the quality of the current print operations, according to Grossman.The Law Review will also grow the amount of material published online in an effort to increase the resources available for scholarly research.
“The Law Review recognizes that legal conversations and legal scholarship are taking place online in addition to print mediums,” Grossman wrote in an email. “The Law Review’s Forum provides a platform for authors to engage with the articles we publish in our print issues and to engage with current legal developments through various forms of online scholarship.”In line with this mission, the Law Review began publishing its print materials online in 2006. The organization also created a “Forum” section on its website where contributors can write exclusively online content. In the past, these articles have come in the form of “Responses,” approximately 2,500 word pieces written in response to articles published in the print journal. With the new push towards expanding the Law Review’s web presence, the “Forum” will also begin publishing “Reactions,” shorter pieces commenting on recent developments in the law, as well as other scholarly essays.Kimberly A. Dulin, associate director for collection development and digitization at the Harvard Law School Library, said she supports the Law Review’s initiative as part of a larger trend towards expanding open access in education.“Definitely we’d love it,” Dulin said. “In general, it’s all to the good when the stuff that’s produced by professors is widely available for legal research and for free.”—Staff writer Dev A.

Following a recent <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/anonymous-schizophrenia-help/"">anonymous op-ed in The Crimson that sparked a campus-wide conversation and a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/22/mental-health-yard-rally/"">Friday rally on the subject of mental health, Undergraduate Council representatives used their general meeting Sunday to discuss steps that the organization could take in the coming weeks to address the issue.The body passed with no opposition and only one abstention the “Mental Health at Harvard Act,” in which the UC resolved to hold a town hall meeting and publish an op-ed in The Crimson on mental health.The legislation also referred to the recent op-ed on mental health services offered at Harvard that came the day before a spontaneous rally on mental health and the creation of the “Coalition to Reform Mental Health Services at Harvard.” With the act’s passage, the UC made official its support of the newly formed coalition, resolving that the UC would listen to the group’s concerns, provide it with “opportunities to engage with administrators,” and help with it with grassroots efforts.“I think that we have a really unique opportunity right now to leverage whatever sort of influence and ability to organize that we have to address an issue that is a concern right now,” said Crimson Yard representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16.UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said during the meeting that she thought the potential for a referendum on the issue might be an important aspect of the larger role she envisions the UC playing in the ongoing conversation on mental health.
Representatives discussed other possible measures to address mental health concerns. Treasurer Jonathan Y. Li ’14 suggested the formation of a group of peer counselors unaffiliated with the University that could function as a supportive network for students. Representatives also floated the idea of the creation of a mental health fund in the Council budget.During the meeting, the UC also finalized plans for its pilot, small-scale Junior Week scheduled to start this week. Representatives Christopher A. Smiles ’15 and Manik R. Kuchroo ’16, the pair responsible for coordinating Junior Week events, announced that this week’s events include a ‘Skate Night’ on Wednesday and a Class of 2014 Speaks event on Thursday night. The UC will also encourage  attendance at the women’s hockey “White the Bright” game against Yale this Saturday. Raghuveer urged the representatives to talk to juniors about attending all these events.“We’re trying to build community on campus. The fact is, community on campus is not good, and I think a lot of the reason for that is because people here are individually motivated, everyone is always too busy to hang out,” Raghuveer said. “We need to fight that by bringing people to these really cool events.”Newly appointed Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, who attended the meeting, said briefly at the beginning that he thought it was important for him to hear the concerns of students. Lassonde will officially assume his position in March.—Staff writer Steven S. Lee can be reached at stevenlee@college.harvard.edu.

“Your mother is not your mother. Your father is not your father. Your friends are not your friends,” says the voice from a rotating record in the final scene of “punkplay.” Alone and desperate, kindred spirits Mickey (Matt J. Bialo ’15) and Duck (Mark J. Mauriello ’15) come together to form a band, zoo sluts, and immerse themselves in punk counterculture, hoping to find a niche for themselves as they struggle to navigate through their teenage years. Gregory S. Moss’s “punkplay,” directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14 and running through March 2 in the Loeb Ex, is heavy in testosterone and crude language, yet surprisingly sensitive and insightful as it details a misfit’s quest for individualism in an era built on conformity.The emotional core of the play is the chemistry of its leads, Bialo and Mauriello. Mauriello’s character, Duck, is thrown out by his father for his refusal to go to military school. Mauriello portrays his character as flamboyant and outrageous, spitting in the face of authority with his dyed hair and smudged eyeliner. It would be easy for Mauriello to overwhelm Bialo, whose character is less physically arresting and whose development is much more subtle, but instead, the two act as perfect foils.At the emotional climax of the play, Mickey and Duck must confront their rapidly changing bond: in a typical high school scene, Duck betrays Mickey in an effort to look cool for the town’s resident punk idol (Christian N. Fohrby ’14 ). Duck and Mickey engage in a fistfight that quickly alternates between a romantic slow dance and a progressively violent brawl. The entirety of the play takes place on roller skates, and in this scene, Bialo and Mauriello skate around each other figuratively and literally as they grapple with the different facets of their relationship.The leads’ constantly shifting rapport and the underlying franticness of the play’s punk-tinged edges are enhanced by the clever lighting design of Alexandra M. Kiley ’15 and Anna G. Kelsey ’14. The play appears as a series of vignettes strung together by the lighting, which provides seamless transitions between the scenes. Flashing in a dizzying array of red and blue, the lighting is coupled with punk music and teenage head-banging as weeks and months blend together. Without the lighting, the play would fall apart; it compresses time in a way that contributes to the play’s sharp and caustic tongue as well as its sporadic nature.Brandt manages to bring out the inner struggle of the characters throughout the play, which is at its core a coming-of-age story. He communicates the theme of the play particularly well in Mickey’s dream sequence, which opens with a talking chair, a body of Mickey’s paramour Sue Gici (Lily R. Glimcher ’14) with the head of Ronald Reagan, a pedantic clock, and a picture of Jesus Christ. In less than nimble hands, the scene would be an incoherent mess, but Brandt manages to create a sense of order by using windows to frame the elements—a picture of Jesus Christ in one, which represents Mickey’s consciousness, and a clock in the other. Against the backdrop of the flashing lights, the scene becomes a perverse confessional hearing, a unique dramatic feat thanks to the successful partnership between director and lighting designers.
The play conveys a distinct feeling of intrusion through Brandt's set design. All of the action takes place in Mickey’s room, enclosed by three walls. Scenes that take place outside of the room are never actually seen; rather, they seem to seep in through the doors. Despite Mickey and Duck’s attempt to break free from the shackles of society through their immersion in punk, they find themselves stuck in a self-imposed cage—the conformity of the punk scene, signified by the claustrophobic set. It feels ironic that the set design places the two teenagers in the center of the action, when they try so hard to stay on the periphery of society.Brandt’s production of “punkplay” manages to comment on a larger theme even as it incorporates unconventional scenes, non-standard props like roller skates, and a limited set where the action takes place. In the end it is the idea of personal identity and counterculture in the ’80s that emerge as the strongest parts of the production.—Staff writer Neha Mehrotra can be reached at nehamehrotra@college.harvard.edu.

All season long, the Harvard women’s track and field team has relied primarily on its throwing corps to put points on the board and keep the squad competitive. While the Crimson throwers continued to impress at the Indoor Heptagonal Championships over the weekend, it was the team’s group of sprinters who stepped up in a big way for Harvard.Going into the final two events of the two-day competition, which was held at Gordon Indoor Track, the Crimson was clinging to a 101-100.7 lead over Cornell. In the penultimate event—the 4x800-meter relay—Harvard finished in second place and the Big Red in fifth to extend the Crimson’s lead to just over six points.“There was a huge amount of pressure [on the relay teams],” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I think they all knew what was at stake and they just went out there and executed.”In the final event of the championship meet—the 4x400-meter dash—Harvard’s quartet of freshmen Autumne Franklin and Christi Scott, sophomore Gabrielle Scott, and junior Olivia Abbate needed to finish in fourth place or better to secure the team title.“I was anchor leg so I felt a lot of pressure,” Franklin said. “Especially because the score was so close, I felt like it was all on me.”
Though Cornell topped the Harvard foursome in the relay, Franklin crossed the finish line in second place to earn her team the conference crown.“[After the race] people were crying, people were running up to me and giving me hugs, and picking me up off my feet,” Franklin said. “Everyone was so excited about the win. There’s been so much energy, it’s been wonderful.”Including the eight points from the 4x400, 59 of the team’s 117 total points came in sprinting events, as the Crimson edged the Big Red by a final tally of 117-112.7 to win the Ivy League Championship for the first time since 2000. On the men’s side, Harvard recorded 86 team points, which was good for third place behind Cornell and Princeton.“It was awesome,” Saretsky said. “That’s the best word I can use to describe it. We came into the meet with an outside chance to win it, and we had a number of people really step up and have some amazing performances out there. I just couldn’t be prouder of our women’s team.”The weekend began in record-setting fashion for the Harvard women. Coming off a dominant performance at the HYP meet two weeks ago, junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu cruised to a victory in the weight throw. Though the junior, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, scratched on her first two throws, her final toss of 20.83 meters broke the Ancient Eight record that she set at HYP. Ekechukwu’s closest competitor, Princeton freshman Julia Ratcliffe, who set the conference record at the beginning of the season, was two full meters short of the record-breaking heave.Ekechukwu was named the women’s MVP of the meet, a distinction that was earned on the men’s side by senior Nico Weiler for his performance in the pole vault. Weiler, who finished in fourth place at last year’s outdoor NCAA Championships, won the event with a clearance of 5.38 meters. None of the event’s other participants cleared a height greater than 4.70 meters.“[Ekechukwu and Weiler] put in so much hard work and are clearly very talented as well,” Saretsky said. “They’re just national-caliber athletes.”Weiler’s victory gave the Crimson 10 team points, a figure that was doubled by a trio of throwers in the shot put. Junior Dustin Brode, sophomore Ben Glauser, and senior Edward Brucker finished in first, third, and fourth place, respectively, in the event.On the women’s side, Harvard notched 18 points in the 60-meter hurdles, as Franklin and classmate Martina Salander took the top two spots in the event.“I couldn’t have asked for anything more in my race,” Franklin said. “I think I was just very focused…. Also, with the energy of the meet, I felt like I was just absorbing all of the hype.”Franklin crossed the finish line in a blistering 8.43 seconds, besting the Heps record by 0.01 seconds. Salander was just behind her classmate, coming in at 8.57 seconds.“For our women to go out there and come away with the victory on our home track was a really, really special moment,” Saretsky said. “We’re hoping this is the first of many.”—Staff writer Dominic Martinez can be reached at dmartinez@college.harvard.edu.

Despite having the match of his career on Saturday, junior Gary Power wasn’t powerful enough to lead the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team to a national championship.After dropping his first two games in the semifinal against No. 2 Princeton, Power came back to sweep the next three and propel the Crimson into the final round.It wasn’t enough.Twenty-four hours later, the Crimson fell to Trinity for the second time this season in New Haven as Power dropped his second close match in two days.In Harvard’s first appearance in the final round of the Potter Cup since its second place finish in 2004-2005, the Crimson couldn’t hold on against an undefeated Bantams squad. Trinity won its 14th championship in 15 years, after being unseated last year for the first time in 13 years by Princeton.
Finishing the season with a 17-3 record, the Crimson will look to make another run at the title next season and win its first championship since 1998.“[I have] mixed feelings,” junior Ali Farag said. “I think the whole season we had the goal of winning and also we persevered and the final went either way. This will make us nothing but stronger and harder to beat next year.”TRINITY 6, HARVARD 3Despite jumping out to a lead against the Bantams, the Crimson dropped contests in the fourth through eighth slots and left defeated.“Trinity is a lot better prepared than any other team,” Farag said. “They took the title home, but they were more lucky and determined today. I think it could have gone either way, but we couldn’t get the two matches that we need.”Farag swept his match, 3-0, in the top spot and held Bantam junior Reinhold Hergeth to five points or less in each game. Harvard also saw victories from No. 3 junior Nigel Koh and No. 9 senior Alexander Ma.“It meant a lot to be trusted by my teammates and go up and represent Harvard in such an important match and by all the alums who haven’t been in that place in so long,” Ma said. “Harvard has a rich tradition in squash and as a senior I made it my goal to reward everyone for their hard work.”Playing in the No. 4 spot, Power came back from a first game loss to take the next two against Trinity’s sophomore Karan Malik, outscoring his opponent 22-13. But the senior couldn’t keep his streak going, dropping the final two games and taking a 3-2 loss, his third of the season.HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 4Despite Farag losing the first match of his collegiate career, the Crimson held the Tigers at bay to win the semifinal round of the Potter Cup.

Entering Friday night it looked as if the Harvard men’s hockey team (8-16-3, 5-13-2 ECAC) was going to continue a recent trend of finishing an otherwise disappointing season on a high note. St. Lawrence (16-11-4, 9-6-4) faced a Crimson team on a season-high four-game unbeaten streak.Freshman forward Jimmy Vesey had put the Crimson up 2-1 early in third period at Appleton Arena, with assists from sophomore Colin Blackwell—his fourth in five games—and assistant captain Alex Fallstrom.But midway through the final frame, that lead would quickly disappear.After a tripping penalty by captain Danny Biega at 7:57 in the third, Saints senior defenseman George Hughes netted a power-play goal to tie the score at two, with helpers from captain Kyle Flanagan and junior Justin Baker.Just 12 seconds later, junior forward Greg Carey claimed the lead for St. Lawrence, scoring what would be the game-winner off assists from junior forward Jeremy Wick and senior defenseman Jordan Dewey.
“Unfortunately the game turned around that quickly,” freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo said. “The two-goal swing kind of changed the momentum on us.”“We battled hard, it was definitely disappointing,” added freshman goalie Peter Traber, who backed up junior netminder Raphael Girard in the game.The crowd seemed to play a factor at Appleton Arena, which is located a few miles from the Canadian border in upstate New York.“That rink is old; there’s not much to do at St. Lawrence,” Criscuolo said. “So they always get a good fanbase, and they got the momentum from us.”Carey has been on fire this season, averaging a nation-high 1.47 goals per game while tallying 25 goals and 47 points, also best in the country. Complementing his scoring has been Flanagan, with 28 assists and 40 points, good for third-best and fifth-best in the nation, respectively.With the victory, the Saints increased their winning streak to four, highlighted by an upset one week earlier against No. 1 Quinnipiac, where they handed the top-ranked Bobcats their first loss in 22 games.Harvard remains in last place in the ECAC with this loss to second-place St. Lawrence. With two games remaining in the regular season and the Crimson three points behind Colgate, Harvard will need some help to move up and avoid its first last place finish in at least 50 years.In the first period, the Crimson took the first lead of the game with a power-play goal from senior Marshall Everson. It marked his fifth straight game with a goal, a career-high goal streak. Biega and senior Luke Greiner were attributed with assists.Everson, last week’s ECAC player of the week—the first such honor this season for Harvard—claimed the lead in goals for the Crimson before Vesey propelled himself back into a tie for the lead with his third-period goal. Each has 11 goals on the season, though the freshman leads the team in points with 17, along with Fallstrom and fellow freshman Brian Hart.Biega’s assist brought his season total to seven on the season, to go with two goals. Though he has had a significant drop-off from last season’s production, in which he tallied 10 goals, 25 assists, and 35 points—including a league-high 14 on the power play—the captain was recently nominated for the 2013 Senior CLASS Award.He is the only nominee from the ECAC and just the second from Harvard, the first since 2009, when Brian McCafferty ’09 was up for the award that is presented to NCAA Division I athletes who excel in the four areas of community, classroom, character, and competition.11:20 into the first period, Flanagan knotted the score at one with help from junior defenseman Pat Raley and sophomore forward Justin Bruckel.After St. Lawrence stormed back to take the lead in the third, sophomore forward Patrick Doherty added some insurance late in the game with a goal at 14:55 for the Saints, assisted by sophomore forwards Gunnar Hughes and Tommy Thompson.Despite the loss, the Crimson outshot St. Lawrence, 26-25, and 14-7 in the third period alone. Girard had 21 saves on the night for Harvard, while Matt Weninger had 24 saves for the Saints.—Staff writer David A. Mazza can be reached at damazza@college.harvard.edu.

With the score 15-13 in the Lions favor, the winner of the heavyweight bout in Harvard wrestling’s (8-5, 6-4 EIWA) match against Columbia (6-8, 3-5) would earn his team the dual-meet win at the Crimson’s final home match.Heavyweight freshman Nick Gajdzik took the mat to battle it out against Lions’ senior Chris Manna. Heading into the second period, neither wrestler tallied a single point. The score remained 0-0 after Gajdzik held Manna pointless for the duration of the second period. In the final frame, the Harvard rookie registered a point after an escape and eventually secured a 2-0 decision, bringing the final score to 16-15 for a Crimson victory.“[Nick] likes the spotlight, he likes the pressure, and it’s especially rare to see that in a freshman,” co-captain Walter Peppelman said. “Nick had a phenomenal match against a tough competitor.”Harvard and Columbia battled back and forth throughout the dual meet, with the score never staying in either team’s favor for long.In usual fashion, freshman Jeffrey Ott started off the match in the 125 pound weight class. Ott wrestled a high-scoring bout against the Lions’ Penn Gottfried but eventually topped the junior with a 14-7 decision to snag the first win for the Crimson.
“With Jeff Ott at 125, I thought he wrestled really well,” Peppelman said. “He attacked from start to finish. He wasn’t able to get the major decision, but he wrestled really hard, and I was proud of him.”Columbia answered with a 3-2 win at 133, as junior Matt Bystol came back from a 1-0 deficit to Harvard senior Shay Warren in the final period to tie the total score.The Crimson struck back when co-captain Steven Keith registered his 102nd career win after securing a 7-0 decision, shutting out Alec Mooradian of the Lions.“We rattled off another win at 141 with Steven,” Peppelman said. “Steven was just shy of a major decision, and that was a big win for him.”Freshman Todd Preston took to the mat against No. 5 Steve Santos in the 149 weight class. Preston held Santos 0-0 until Columbia’s senior managed an escape at the beginning of the second period. Santos ended up holding the 1-0 lead to snag the win and tie up the score.“At 149, Todd Preston, one of our freshmen, he just keeps getting better,” Peppelman said. “He wrestled the No. 5 guy in the country…. I’m really proud of Todd and how far he has come.”At 157, Peppelman wrestled his last dual-meet match against Jake O’Hara and topped him in a 3-0 decision. Many Lions on the bench contested the call, causing the official to dock one team-point from Columbia, bringing the score to 9-5 with Harvard in the lead.The Lions responded with a 10-1 major decision in the 165 pound weight class, tying up the match once again. Columbia grabbed the lead after junior Cameron Croy fell to Stephen West when the Lions’ senior escaped Croy early on in the final frame. West held off the Harvard junior to secure the 4-3 decision.“Cameron Croy lost a tough match to a really good competitor,” Peppelman said. “He almost had him at the end, but he wrestled hard during the whole match.”Columbia extended its lead after registering a third consecutive win at 184, but sophomore James Fox brought the Crimson back into the match after coming out of the gates strong and dominating his opponent with an 11-2 major decision.

It doesn’t get much closer than the Harvard women’s tennis team’s (2-3) 4-3 loss to the Boston College Eagles (5-0, 1-0 ACC). Seven tiebreakers. Four third sets. Four final sets decided by tiebreakers. When matches get tight, like they did on Saturday, it can be difficult to separate an individual performance from what’s happening on the other courts.“When the match gets close it is incredibly important that you focus on your match because you don’t want what is happening with other teammates to take away your attention,” sophomore Sylvia Li said. “You don’t want the teammate playing a match next to you to be what you are focusing on.”After dropping the doubles point, the Crimson split the first two singles matches. Freshman Amy He scored a 6-3, 7-6 (11) victory over Boston College’s Alex Kelleher in the second spot while Li lost a pair of tiebreakers on the third line. All four singles matches went into the third set, with the Eagles pulling out three-set victories at the first and sixth lines as co-captain Hideko Tachibana and freshman Crystal Yen fell, 4-6 and 6-7 (5) in the third set, respectively.“We always have a fun rivalry when we play Boston College,” coach Traci Green said. “The match came down to the wire and it was pretty back-and-forth the entire way through. Unfortunately it didn’t go our way. Each match was very close. We fought extremely hard and I feel like we competed at a solid level and we just came up unlucky in a couple of tiebreakers.”Harvard continued its rotation at the doubles position, moving Tachibana and He up to the first line, where they lost in a tiebreaker, 7-8 (5). Freshman Hai-Li Kong and junior Natalie Blosser played together for the first time this year, falling, 3-8. At the third line, Li and junior Hannah Morrill scored Harvard’s lone doubles victory—capitalizing on an early break to get an 8-5 victory. Despite the loss, Tachibana said she was happy with how the team competed—a quality that will be important as it heads into Ivy League matchups.
“I’m encouraged by the strong determination of our players,” Tachibana said. “The Ivy League is looking really tough and it will come down to clinchers, and often times who wins those matches isn’t based on pure talent but who can push past their nerves and get the victory. It’s good to see that we have a lot of fighters on the team. It was great to see everyone fighting for the very last point.”Green said that the team views its non-conference schedule as preparation for its Ivy League schedule. The Crimson will play between two and four freshman in any given match depending on the health of the team—on Saturday, co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amanda Lin were out with injuries—and Green said each match is a learning experience for the young squad.“We think of all of our matches as part of preparation for Ivies so we want to make sure we get in coaching in each and every match, whether it is close or not close,” Green said. “You want [the freshmen] to learn to think on the run and ultimately that will make them more confident at key moments in matches.”After winning its first match of the season, Harvard has struggled, losing three of its last four against top-tier opponents. However, after playing its last three matches against Big Six Conference schools, the Crimson gets three smaller conference schools at home over the next two weeks. The Crimson will play five of its next seven matches at home.Green said that after the Nemo snowstorm interrupted the team’s non-conference schedule, matches the past two weekends against BC and Maryland have been key in getting the team back in form. Green said that Harvard, who has dealt with injuries all season, will be a formidable squad when healthy.“We have a lot of heart and a lot of fire. All we have to do is put it all together and get everybody healthy and we will be a tough team to beat,” Green said. “We got snowed out with the recent blizzard and this match really helped for the freshmen. Each and every match we are growing as a team and I am looking forward to our next match this coming weekend. This team is great to work with and it’s really fun to coach this team.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter at @CrimsonDPFreed.

After two weeks of inaction, the Harvard women’s water polo team returned to the pool to take on competition at the CWPA/MAAC Crossover at Villanova.The Crimson (7-4) began its weekend on a sour note with two losses on Saturday. The first, a 10-8 defeat, came at the hands of Wagner, and the second came when Harvard fell to Iona a few hours later in a 17-14 affair.But the team seized on the opportunity to bounce back the next day and captured two wins to end the weekend with an even slate. The Crimson offense twice tied its season-best 20 goals scored, first defeating Villanova, 20-10, and going on to beat Siena by a score of 20-6.“It was a good weekend to get ready for conference play, which starts next weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “It was good to get back in the water and play competition. I thought we did some good things, and I think there are some things we can definitely go back and improve on.”HARVARD 20, VILLANOVA 10
Although the Crimson defeated Villanova (0-14) decisively by 15 goals two weeks ago, Harvard did not look past its opponents the second time around as the dominant Crimson offense propelled the squad past the Wildcats.Sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes anchored Harvard in net to match her career-high 13 saves. Co-captain Aisha Price also contributed six assists in the high-scoring affair to set a new career mark.“I can’t take any credit for anything that I’ve done,” Price said. “I have the opportunity to play with amazing girls. It’s so fun to play with them every weekend.”Freshman Charlotte Hendrix, who is the team’s high scorer, led the Crimson offense with six goals. Seven other Harvard players found the back of the net, including sophomore Kalina Grabb and freshman Yoshi Andersen, who both contributed three-goal performances.The Crimson produced consistently on the offensive end all game, scoring five goals in each of the four periods of play.Progress was also made on the defensive front, as seven Harvard players totaled at least 2 steals to combine for a team season-high of 20.After the win over Villanova, the Crimson took on Siena (0-4) in its final game of the weekend. Harvard came out on top by a score of 20-6, once again equaling its season-high in scoring and achieving its second largest margin of victory on the year.IONA 17, HARVARD 14Although the Crimson held a one-goal lead after the first period, Iona (5-3) struck back in the second to outscore Harvard by two. In the second half, the two teams played back-and-forth water polo, but the Gaels managed to outpace the Crimson by two goals to capture a 17-14 win.Harvard hung with Iona the entire game, as three of the four quarters were decided by one goal.

I learned the hard way that there is more to an interview than just answering questions; interviews are full of social norms like punctuality and shaking hands. So that others may learn from my mistakes, I have broken down some of the less obvious complexities of the standard interview.<!--more-->1. Don't Apply DrunkI find that the problem with applying drunk is not bad grammar or spelling mistakes, but rather poor judgment when it comes to qualifications and an inability to remember what you actually applied for. I discovered during one recent interview that I had applied for a pre-med program in Chile and listed as my qualifications my familiarity with WebMD and over the counter decongestants.If worst comes to worst and you wake up one morning with a hangover and a conformation email—show up drunk to the interview. You will want to be in the same mind-set as when you applied so that you remember what you applied for; it's a psychology thing.2. Make Sure the Interview is in English
Or that you know the language you are being interviewed in.Turns out that when I am put on the spot I loose the ability to conjugate verbs. Why do I want to live in Chile? To learn, to live, to teach…Another useful tip: remember nouns. The list of farm vocabulary you learn in 9th grade can only do so much for your interview—unless you want to work on ""el campo,"" which, if anyone asks, I do.3. Have a Question ReadyWhen the interviewer asks if you have any questions at the end of the interview, always say yes. Even if you don't have real questions, showing interest and the ability to create inflection in conversation is critical. If you are at a loss for questions, ask your interviewer where she bought her pantsuit, or what time it is.In my case Qué hora es?

Given that Seth MacFarlane has built his career on being as bombastically outrageous as possible, he shouldn't have been surprised when his attempts to laugh off a terrible opening monologue were unconvincing.The majority of the content of the 2013 Oscars left us mostly wondering what any of it had to do with the 2013 Oscars. A musical revue featuring ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Chicago,"" frequent pictures of John Travolta in ""Hairspray,"" and weird, patronizing clips about why technical work is important were only some of the wonders to which the audience was subjected last night.<!--more-->Thankfully, the weirdness subsided for the actual award recipients, among whom there were few surprises. Christoph Waltz and Anne Hathaway were bestowed Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Actress in a Supporting Role, respectively, and both predictably received their awards with bashful glee.Quentin Tarantino, replete in leather tie as he accepted his Best Original Screenplay win for ""Django Unchained,"" contrasted the muted acceptance of ""Argo"" for Best Adapted Screenplay with a satisfying inability to act normal in a public setting. Meryl Streep barely looked at the envelope before announcing Daniel Day-Lewis as the winner for Best Actor. (Bonus points for Joaquin Phoenix's nearly audible sigh during his competitor zoom-in.)Jennifer Lawrence received a similar perfunctory huzzah, tripping over herself in the cutest Zooey Deschanel fashion on her way to collect her award onstage. Adele sang dramatically, and Ben Affleck was lovably earnest and uncomposed in accepting the Best Picture award for ""Argo,"" using more sports metaphors than there are in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Daniel Radcliffe and Kristen Stewart awkwardly presented an award with the noticeable absence of their common link—one Mr. Cedric Diggory. It was an idealized picture of the status quo, save for Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi,"" which took home a Best Director award and the tiger's share of the technical awards.
Then again, there was that moment when Jack Nicholson and Michelle Obama strangely tag-teamed the Best Picture announcement. For a hot second, we thought that this was gearing up for a ""Zero Dark Thirty"" win quickly followed by a rousing chant of ""GM is alive. Bin Laden is dead.""Alas, the only true surprise about the whole night was how genuinely anticlimactic it was, and thus it seems sadly appropriate that Seth MacFarlane dropped insults about Quentin Tarantino's style or Jean Dujardin's flagging career that could have been made six months ago. However, given the year's genuinely exciting crop of films—from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748122/?ref_=sr_1"">Lana Del Rey Jr.'s precious love story on Cape Cod to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443272/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"">Philip Seymour Hoffman's masterful turn to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/?ref_=sr_1"">the best Bond movie in years—it seems strange that such a cavalcade of talent did not express itself last night in the slightest.

With the Academy Awards now over, Flyby caught up with Harvard's very own <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/20/ben-zauzmer-oscar-guru-2013/"">Oscar guru Ben Zauzmer '15. Zauzmer, who <a href=""http://oscarforecast.wordpress.com/"">published data predicting the Oscar wins, used available data pertaining to the nominees to predict the likelihood they would go home with an Oscar. Zauzmer tells Flyby how the math matched up to the winning movies.<!--more--> Flyby: How do you think the show went overall compared to your predictions?BZ: I was delighted. Overall, the model went 17 for 21, and it called two of the big, close to call categories, Best Movie for Argo and Best Director Ang Lee, which, for many, seemed to be an upset.[Editor's Note: Best Director was the only major category in which Zauzmer had a different prediction than that of statistics wizard <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/11/silver-politics-baseball-statistics/"">Nate Silver. Zauzmer's prediction was ultimately correct.]
 Flyby: Which of your predictions worked? Which didn't?BZ: The ones that didn't work were the extremely close ones... those were all in single digit percentages, those were pretty much a toss up anyway. The other one was the Best Original Screenplay award.  Flyby: In your own opinion, all data aside, how happy are you with this year's winners?BZ: Outside of the data, I think that a lot of the movies for me were all middle-of-the road. I don't think there was anything that truly stood out as one of the all time greats. [But] there was nothing that won that I felt didn't truly deserve to win. Flyby: What did you do for the Oscars?BZ: Mather was generous, they gave me money and space to throw a party, and it was a great night.

An unreliable narrator-cum-émigré writes his confession to a jury about why he kidnapped his young daughter and drove her through America. The pair shack up in hotel rooms, the older man lumbering paranoid through days, fearing he will be forced to give up the light of his life. However, his daughter is not also the fire of his loins, and therein lies the obvious difference between “Schroder: A Novel,” by Amity Gaige, and its instinctual comparison work, Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita.” Thankfully, it is not just the lack of sexual obsession that differentiates the two; no, with playful rejection of Nabokov’s style and a focus on the even more seductive concept of assimilation, “Schroder” succeeds despite Gaige’s refusal to remain slave to the Nabokovian verve that endeared so many to “Lolita.”The titular character reinvents himself from East German immigrant Erik Schroder to American all-star Eric Kennedy—slyly insinuating familial ties to the Kennedys by claiming he grew up in the fictional Twelve Hills, “a stone’s throw from Hyannis Port.” In describing his fascination with all things American, Erik writes: “At first I’d feel a pop of childish wonder, but this wonder was followed by the urge to stuff it back, because if I were a real American I would not have been in the least impressed with any of it.” With this opening salvo, Gaige refuses to fetishize a foreigner’s experience and the English language as Nabokov does in “Lolita” and “Pnin,” lending even more legitimacy to the narration’s plain style.After decades as Eric Kennedy, Schroder’s marriage collapses and he is relegated to a satellite position in his daughter Meadow’s life so that his identity theft won’t be revealed. Throughout his fear runs a difficulty in remembering that his constructed life as Kennedy is a lie, as in lines such as “For a moment the groom believed...that there actually was such a place as Twelve Hills.” This delusion is subtly contrasted with his father’s halting German advice to Schroder that informs his decision to kidnap his daughter, which Schroder helpfully translates roughly as “I can definitely stuff my daughter in my trunk as I attempt to cross the Canadian border” instead of as poignant commentary on the Berlin Wall, as it was meant. The type of self-delusion that is taking place is clear, but since the narrator himself is not completely aware of it, it comes across as more convincing.And here is where Gaige subtly concocts an anti-heroic Eric Kennedy who can never admit he is wrong and a guilt-torn, honest Schroder who fills up a page with “I let you down” repeated like Catholic school punishment lines. There are the blatant similarities to Humbert Humbert, but each parallel scene is qualified. Schroder meets his wife in a park, as opposed to Humbert on a park bench lusting over girls a third of his age. Both emotionally manipulate older women—the surprisingly well-developed April Almond in “Schroder,” who criticizes Schroder and the purposely undeveloped Charlotte Haze in “Lolita,” who merely fawns. This more honest, straightforward approach to a liar is well-made and appropriate given that the his grossest prevarication was solely about his nationality—a more sympathetic, less icky lie. The coup of the the book is reached when Schroder realizes that he is transferring his own insecurity about his identity upon his daughter, a conclusion that feels true and belated, yet is appreciated.Another difference is that Gaige’s language is not frilly and suffocatingly allusive, and it instead flits between different types of language exercises that prevent the novel as a whole from becoming nauseatingly navel-gazing. Schroder inserts a humorous snippet of a play that he’s written about offering his wife a snack: “How about a pretzel? A fruitcake? Lamb with mint jelly? WHY IS EVERYTHING I OFFER YOU INSUFFICIENT?” Gaige also inserts snatches of German from Schroder’s past and pauses the narration in just the right moments to signpost upon which parts it is worth dwelling.
Gaige generally takes risks with these various writing exercises, and with the choice to organize the book into a short-chapter format, she creates a many-parted machine that does not become fractured given Schroder’s frequently all-consuming delusion that he is indeed Eric Kennedy. The direct allusions to Nabokov—Meadow wants to become a lepidopterist, a hobby of Nabokov; a nice complicator when a bartender on their road trip tells Meadow that “You shouldn’t trust anyone over the age of twelve. After twelve, it’s lies, lies, lies”—are similarly fractured and don’t constitute major themes in the story, but also don’t deny the book’s identity. With more allusions, the prose would become needlessly stilted; with fewer, it would sound ungrateful.Admittedly, it is instinctual to comment about the differences and similarities between “Schroder” and “Lolita”—and furthermore, it’s a daunting task to break out of Nabokov’s imprisoning enchantment. But do not misunderstand. Gaige succeeds in making Schroder’s life story, of his father also “kidnapping” him away to America, not seem an illegitimate excuse for his crime, like the teenaged Humbert Humbert’s truncated love of Anabel Lee.Adding a believable sense of shame, Gaige creates an endearing protagonist not only defined by his willingness to “tell the truth” in a statement to a jury. What makes Schroder alive is his vivid fear of actually admitting that he has a breach in his own identity much larger than the hole in the Berlin Wall through which he and his father cautiously slipped. Schroder’s apology seems sincere, and a crisis of identity can finally be identified and spoken about 50 years later instead transferred upon a 12-year-old girl. And thus, we have an unreliable narrator who transcends the haze of his crime.—Staff writer Christine A. Hurd can be reached at churd@college.harvard.edu.

On Friday, Chris Kaskie, the president of the prominent online music magazine Pitchfork Media, participated in a public interview with Panos Panay, the founder of Sonicbids, a portal that brings together concert organizers and bands. Pitchfork Media, founded in 1995, is an online publication dedicated to music journalism, with a particular focus on up-and-coming, independent music. The event was part of the 20th Annual James G. Zafris Jr. Distinguished Lecture Series for Music Business/Management at the Berklee College of Music.Straightforward and honest, Kaskie told the story of his early days at Pitchfork. While he was working at the Chicago-based satirical publication The Onion, he was an avid music fan and Pitchfork reader. One day, Kaskie ordered a review book published by Pitchfork and never got it. So, he decided to email the company’s founder, Ryan Schreiber, to tell him that he, Kaskie, was proficient in sales and would be willing to guide business operations. Schreiber hired Kaskie over the phone and said, “Dude, let’s go have a beer.” After that beer, Kaskie moved into Schreiber’s basement and began to work on the site and live with Schreiber’s cats.Schreiber and Kaskie knew from the beginning that they wanted to do something unlike the rest of the online music criticism world. “When everybody was zigging, we wanted to zag,” Kaskie said. He claimed that the willingness to do good business comes before profit.  The big moment came in 2005 with the launch of Pitchfork Festival, then called the Intonation Music Festival, a music festival organized by Pitchfork, which attracted 20,000 ardent fans. Kaskie attributed this success to the fact that this event, which he described as a counter-festival, was designed to be deliberately different from mainstream music festivals.Kaskie also talked about problems he sees in the contemporary cultural approach to music. In particular, he mentioned passive listening, which is the phenomenon in which listeners receive a playlist dictated by tools and algorithms designed to reflect their taste, rather than selected by the listeners directly. According to Kaskie, the aim of Pitchfork is to avoid this sort of occurrence by putting people in touch with new music through recommendations directly from other music lovers, rather than through an automated algorithm. Kaskie’s advice to the audience on how to find music was curating a Twitter feed, reading Pitchfork, and simply talking to people. “[Commercial radio is] the most concise filtration of music,” Kaskie said.Other problems he identified included the estrangement of artist from fan, and the fleeting intangible nature of digital media. Kaskie asserted that the removal of intermediaries between the artist and the fan produces more uniqueness and transparency in the music, which he sees as a major advantage. He also predicted that the future of the music industry would involve the resurrection of the album, and said he still buys vinyl to be able to leave something for his kids.
After the lecture, Kaskie spoke with The Harvard Crimson.The Harvard Crimson: Do you think recognition depends more or less on the merit of the musician than on networking and the musician’s ability to reach a wider audience?Chris Kaskie: I think it will inevitably always be merit, because that’s what’s going to last... Ultimately the quality of your art is what’s going to resonate with any audience, whether it be big or small. So, growing that audience is the challenge, and how you do that, and as long as the art and the quality of your art maintains itself recognition should grow. But you have to work for that, obviously, whether it be live or finding the right promotional outlets and developing relationships with publications [and] blogs—whatever—that just know what you’re doing. And labels I think are still a huge part of that.THC: If merit is that important, why do you think people who claim to value quality in music are drawn to discovering the obscure? Why is mainstream not considered good quality?CK: I don’t know. I think that everyone wants to be unique and [have] their taste in music be unique, so as something becomes bigger or becomes more ubiquitous, it becomes more [conventional]. There’s a tendency for any invested music fan to go different [which is] becoming the norm even if the norm is really small. I think there’s a certain person that wants to keep finding it, but you also run the risk of—if you go too far, you forget the stuff that you may have gone past but still also very good. You need to make sure you don’t ignore that.THC: How do you think Pitchfork plays a role in the artist’s efforts to turn fans into customers?CK: The festival is the closest thing to that, but no, we don’t have a purpose like that. Our job is to cover music as honestly and as best as we can. Whether that’s success or non-success is irrelevant to our thinking. I mean we’re not in the business of creating, making bands. We’re talking about what’s good and bad, really. And if that ends up helping expose them to more all eyes or ears whatever, that’s great, and the closest we can get to that is, “Here’s all our favorite stuff, we hope you enjoy it.”THC: Are there any new features that we should look forward to?CK: I think we’re going to continue to enhance the way we build our mobile platforms because we want to have our site available to everybody wherever they want it. It’s exciting because we’ve always been a website and while print moved backwards and went online we’re looking at how to push online forward. We’re definitely in the position where we want to  innovate online publishing, whereas before we were a website when the print is the one that’s innovating, at least in many people’s eyes. Now, it’s a challenge that we fully feel like we’re in the driver’s seat and/or the passenger seat and kind of ready to tackle.THC: What are some music events and festivals that you’re looking forward to in the upcoming months?CK: South by Southwest [music festival] is always fun. It’s the only real thing that I do that becomes kind of industry-specific, so there’s an element of “bummerness” to that too. But there’s a lot of industry people that I really like, so that’s okay too. And then we have our festival in July. We [also] program a stage at a festival in Barcelona, Spain. It’s probably the best festival on earth. We’re one of the six or seven stages, but we have a very large stage. I look forward to that because the Spanish love what we do and they also have a very good vibrant local scene. The European festival stuff is game-changing—I wish we could be like that.

At  center stage in the international limelight, Beyoncé Giselle  Knowles-Carter is the poster girl of fame. But first and foremost,  Beyoncé is a person, one who feels as deeply as her fans and critics  alike. In “Life Is But A Dream,” the autobiographical film she directed  and produced that was released on Feb. 16 on HBO, Beyoncé poignantly  gives a reminder of just that. She explains her journey to  independence—from taking on the challenge of managing herself to finding  happiness.  Through a medley of professional footage of her onstage  performances, behind-the-scenes moments, home movies, and private videos  taken by Beyoncé on her laptop, “Life Is But a Dream” captures how  personal the artistic experience of music is to Beyoncé and exposes the  complications of fame. By  opening with contrasting scenes of Beyoncé in concert and alone in  thought, “Life Is But a Dream” introduces Beyoncé as both an image and a  person, a dichotomy that is explored further as the film progresses. In  this way, the film sets a central theme, creating a focus for the film  despite the different types of clips used and mix of flashbacks and  recent footage. This sequence visually supports the beginning of  Beyoncé’s narration as she expresses the need for personal independence  amid her overwhelming career. She continues on to explain how the  demands of upholding her image in her career caused estrangement between  her and her father, Mathew Knowles, who had been her manager since she  began performing in Destiny’s Child. The choice of narration in these  beginning scenes creates the perspective through which the film presents  Beyonce’s life. It sets an honest lens that makes the film more of a  personal testimony than a documentary. Throughout  the film, clips of Beyoncé singing alone in both private recordings and  the studio are integrated between her narrations. A connection is shown  between her testimony and the lyrics of her songs.  At one moment, she  sits in the backseat of a car, singing the song “Listen,” the lyrics of  which convey emotion reminiscent of the hurt she feels in her  relationship with her father. When she sings in the studio, the camera  focuses on her facial expressions. The raw emotions, in both her voice  and body, reveal how her artistry is the opportunity to sing from her  heart. This builds on her early statement about her choice to form her  own management company, Parkwood Entertainment. In taking ownership of  her career, she claimed independence for her artistry and, most  importantly, for herself.
 By  conveying the dichotomy of Beyoncé’s fame, the film provides a  perceptive criticism of today’s culture of entertainment. Beyoncé  elucidates how the public eye often doesn’t focus on the deep  musicianship of a celebrity, stating, “All you think of is the picture  and the image that you see all day, everyday, and you don’t see the  human form.” She continues on that the present is no longer the age of  Nina Simone, with whom people fell in love for her voice. Then, people  were enamored by the art of music, not the life of the artist. And  Beyoncé admits how hard it is to cope with people exploiting her life  for entertainment. Through the honesty of Beyoncé’s testimony, the film  exposes the reality of fame, going further to highlight the gravity of  its consequences. This  reality is emphasized most by the inclusion of Beyoncé’s testimony  about the most profound experiences in her womanhood—her miscarriage and  the birth of her daughter. Throughout the film, she expresses joy for  the experience of having a new life inside her—she gave birth to her  daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, in January of 2012. But fame had already  caused detriments in her life, most notably separation from her father,  which leads her to state,  “I had to hide the best thing in my life.”  She admits, “It’s hard to go through painful experiences in the public  eye. It’s hard to have closure.” She goes on to share her experience of  miscarriage. She explains how right after that moment, she went to the  studio and wrote the saddest song she has ever written, but she does not  mention the name of the song. By sharing something so personally  painful, Beyoncé shows that music is not only for personal enjoyment,  but is also a form of therapy for her. The film highlights that fame  puts even the most personal experiences of an artist life at risk for  public exploitation. As  Beyoncé admits, stardom is a fantasy. But, the struggles that every  person experiences is a reality. “Life Is But a Dream” not only gives  deep insight into the thoughts and life of Beyoncé, but also deeply  analyzes the experience of fame. Beyoncé shares, “Ultimately, you’re  independent from you knowing who you are and being happy with yourself.”  But, as the film shows, finally getting to that point in life is not an  easy journey. —Staff writer Nzuekoh N.

Look around a bustling cafe in Harvard Square and you might see more people clutching Kindles and Nooks than paperbacks. In the age of digitization, e-books and e-readers are allowing for portable, convenient reading experiences, and it seems that weekend trips to the library and the innocent wonder of exploring the aisles of bookstores for hours are rituals of the past. But in Cambridge—as well as across the world—a select group of artisans continue to read and print books the old-fashioned way.Bookbinderies—craft houses still practicing an art form begun in the 16th century—are flourishing in spite of this trend. How have they maintained their success in the face of digitized literature? After all, what is the point of creating a hardcover copy of a book if the text can be found in an online database with just the click of a mouse?Even before the advent of literature on screens, though, the art of bookbinding has flown under the radar and been taken for granted. At first glance, the concept of creating covers for books and repairing spines whenever needed might seem mundane tasks to the uninformed. Bookbinders at Widener Library and local bookbinderies acknowledge this perception—they all expressed disbelief and even incredulity when faced with the possibility of an investigation into their craft. “It is a pretty arcane field,” says Tim Jones, director of design and production at Harvard University Press.Yet, bookbinding has shown itself to be perhaps currently the most resilient art form—although new technological changes have revamped aspects of the method, bookbinding itself has withstood the test of time. As long as there is a demand for specialized books to be preserved, the craftsmanship of binding will forever be relevant. And that seems like more than could be said about the creative design of the iPad. “UNDERGROUND HOSPITAL”
Kate Rich, a senior conservation technician at Widener, calls the preservation and imaging department of the library an “underground hospital.” And for good measure—one can’t help but liken the vast, open laboratory in the basement of Widener to an operating room. Every year, 30,000 books go under preservation review and if deemed repairable, will systematically be divided up among the conservation staff of the library to be restored. As Rich sews pages back onto the spine of a book, she remarks how the sewing technique she is using is the same method that was used in the 16th century. “It makes you feel like a part of the tradition,” she says.Rich, along with the rest of the conservation technicians at Widener, all try to ensure that repairs can be made multiple times, as part of the task of bookbinding entails fixing others’ prior attempts at salvaging books. Ann Antonellis, the preservation assistant for Tozzer Library and Cabot Library, emphasizes this point by showing ragged pieces of a couple of pages held together by Scotch tape and staples, which she ultimately duplicated to be rebound in a whole edition. “We keep telling ourselves, ‘They meant well,’” Antonellis says. In the event that a book falls apart again, it is crucial that the previous repair can be easily undone so that the book can be effectively sewn and glued back together. However, sometimes book conservators will leave in traces of the previous repair because these hints can reveal much about the book’s physical history, which actually allows bookbinders like Rich and Antonellis to preserve as much of the original book as possible. “It’s like remodeling a house,” Antonellis says.It is in conservation that many of the creative decisions of book repair come into play.  Hand-binding and producing a book from scratch might involve more artistry, but the kinds of materials and methods used in the art of bookbinding are dependent on the final purpose of the book and the time frame in which it is made. For example, the Harvard University Press generally avoids using thinner cloths when printing books for libraries because the edge of a book can easily rub off whenever it is being taken off the shelf. Japanese tissue and wheat paste are commonly used components in repairing books, while acrylic glue and machine bindings are employed to create new books; it is significantly faster and cheaper for industrial publishing companies to mass-produce bestsellers using commercial binding. Additionally, materials used in manual bookbinding are extremely hard to come by due to limited production and high cost. But the expenses of bookbinding aren’t deterring publishers, corporate or individual, from carrying on the craft.BUSINESS AS USUALFrom a business perspective, the bookbinding sector is no different from other manufacturing and craft industries. Speed and cost efficiency are taken into heavy consideration in order to maximize productivity and profits, and a balance must be found between painstakingly laying the foundation of a book and producing at a rate fast enough to be profitable. “A modern binding line needs time and a slower process to make [engravings] extremely clean with better craftsmanship,” Jones says.This sentiment is echoed by Peter Foster, who works part-time at Widener Library and also runs his own independent bookbindery,  The Brookline Bindery. Foster experiences the high demands of fine binding whenever he adds gold stylings to the numerous cookbooks, family bibles, and dissertations that his clients bring in to be restored or rebound. “Each binder has their own certain style [in] using different procedures to improve quality and speed,” Foster says.Foster operates his climate-controlled workshop in the basement of his house. Having transitioned from a previous career in computer science to bookbinding 10 years ago, Foster and his personal business are proof that the art of bookbinding has by no means died. His bindery has been sustained throughout its history by the multitude of projects clients have brought in over time. Surrounding the large working table in the center of the room are scrolls of differently dyed vellums, sample books full of cloths and leathers, and an assortment of finishing tools used for gold engravings. “There’s a level of pride that goes into the work done,”  Foster says. He enjoys the craft because he has the opportunity to utilize his creativity in a productive manner. “Each project is unique because there is no recipe, and you have to design and construct on your own,” he says.Techniques such as gold stamping help to add a customizable element to bookbinding. Rather than randomly attaching whatever seemed visually appealing to the outside of a book, around the mid-1800s bookbinders began to add simple symbols to the cover to make the outer design relevant to the theme of the book.  Crosses began to appear on the covers of bibles, and little insignias like anchors covered books concerning sailing. It was during this period that wealthy people began to view books as luxury items and requested bookbinders to create adornments on the spines of their books to help embellish personal libraries. Textual and symbolic additions onto the covers of books are now used to communicate the content of the book. “Text is no longer an afterthought at this point,” says Todd Pattison, the collections conservator for the Harvard College Library. “Before, the publisher controlled the appearance of the cover and used it to sell books and, as they say, to ‘follow the money.’”However, much of the current aesthetic decision-making still comes from the bookbinders or publishers themselves. “Nine times out of 10, clients choose my sample designs because they don’t want to take a risk,” says Jeffrey Altepeter, head of the bookbinding department at the North Bennet Street School in downtown Boston.Foster has also discovered this trend in his customers’ behavior when he holds design consultations. “I sometimes have to limit the number of color and paper options I offer, since they tend to become overwhelmed.”

The first phase of the construction of the new Charlesview apartment complex in Allston-Brighton is 70 percent complete, according to The Community Builders, Inc., one of the projects co-developers.The relocation of the 208 families from the old Charlesview apartments to the new apartment complex will begin in mid-June and continue through early September, according to TCB Project Manager James Madden.In a 2007 land swap, Harvard traded a six-acre plot near the Brighton Mills shopping center where the new Charlesview complex will stand for the current Charlesview site, which sits adjacent to the Harvard Business School.Phase one of the Charlesview development includes the construction of 240 rental units to replace those in old Charlesview as well as the creation of business units, a community center, a public park, and an underground parking lot.After the completion of phase one, TCB plans to build 20 houses which they hope to complete in the late fall and early winter.
Throughout the process, Stephanie Anderson Garnett, the director of communications for TCB, emphasized TCB’s commitment to delivering on a “promise made by Harvard and TCB” for a complex which contains “a mix of incomes.”According to Madden, residents of the old Charlesview site were at first hesitant to leave, but are now more optimistic about the shift.“People are jazzed to move,” he said.Mariano Beecher, Housing Opportunities Unlimited relocation coordinator, echoed Madden’s statement.“The majority of residents have a generally positive attitude [of] the move,” Beecher said. “This is an opportunity to move into units that are not dilapidated and falling apart at the seams.”Housing Opportunities Unlimited, the firm hired by TCB to handle the relocation of the residents, has held 20 community meetings in the last six months to address community concerns on the move, Beecher said.Beecher also said that HOU is offering Charlesview residents a number of benefits, including covering the cost of the move.Charlesview residents expressed mixed feelings about the relocation.“We like it here,” Maria A. Osorio said. “I don’t know the new place.”Raisa Shapiro, another Charlesview resident, said that while she was excited about the new apartments, she was not looking forward to the move.“I’m 71 and I have to go someplace,” she said. “But of course it will be much, much better than here. For once we’ll be out of leaks and mice and rats.”—Staff writer Marco J. Barber Grossi can be reached at mbarbergrossi@college.harvard.edu.

Members of Cambridge City Council signed a contract finalizing the details of Richard C. Rossi’s appointment as Cambridge’s next City Manager at the end of Monday night’s City Council meeting.Rossi, currently the Deputy City Manager, was tapped for the position last December nine months after current City Manager Robert W. Healy announced his retirement.The contract stipulates that Rossi will take office July 1 and will serve as City Manager for three years.Cantabrigians crowded into City Hall for the meeting, which focused primarily on proposed construction in Kendall Square.Despite fierce opposition from some Cambridge residents concerned about noise and pollution, the City Council unanimously voted to allow the pharmaceutical company Millennium to construct a new laboratory in Kendall Square.
In order to move the plans forward, the Council amended its current zoning ordinances. Millennium will construct its new 230,000 square foot building in an area previously designated as residential space.The City Council’s decision ended two years of negotiations between Cambridge and the companies Millennium and Forest City, the real estate development company that will construct the complex.Negotiations broke off last spring when the Council realized that the development would jeopardize 168 units of affordable housing. Forest City then returned to the table this fall with a proposal that would not only preserve those 168 units but also create 25 additional units of affordable housing.“What we see before us is a very different petition than that that was filed originally,” said Councillor David P. Maher, who led the negotiations on behalf of the City Council.Maher urged his fellow councillors to support the zoning amendment, calling Millennium “one of the top employers in the greater Boston area.”Some Cantabrigians in attendance raised concerns about the pollution and noise that would result from construction, while others stressed that the new complex would foster job creation and scientific research.“Millennium Pharma is not a company that makes Viagra,” psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert said at the meeting. Gilbert said his wife currently works at Millennium researching a cure for pancreatic cancer.—Staff writer Sonali Y.

Following this month’s spring rush season, Harvard’s three fraternities have accepted a handful of new pledges from a competitive pool of would-be brothers.Sigma Chi accepted 11 new pledges—just over 10 percent of the 107 men who rushed this month—according to president Daniel J. Zangri ’14. Alpha Epsilon Pi has taken on less than 20 percent of its rushes, accepting six new pledges from a pool of between 30 to 35 men, according to president Evan A. Ribot ’14. The president, vice president, and treasurer of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has also completed its spring rush process, did not return repeated requests for comment about the number of new pledges they accepted this season.Unlike the campus sororities, which typically hold a unified rush process each spring governed by the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council, each of Harvard’s fraternities holds its own separate rush process each semester.This past month, each fraternity held an open rush process featuring a series of social events designed to give members and rushes a chance to mingle. Sigma Chi, for example, held four total events—including a three events open to all interested men and a final invitation-only dinner—over the span of several weeks. The accepted rushes will go through a pledge process before being accepted as official members later this semester.Greek organizations on campus, which are not officially recognized by the University, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/2/11/rush-men-number-frats/"">have seen significant growth in recent years. The presidents of Sigma Chi and AEPi both said they have seen increasingly large rush classes in the past few years.
AEPi—which now has 61 official members, likely the most in the campus fraternity’s history, according to Ribot—tried to limit the size of this season’s rush class in response to the fraternity’s growth.“We just kind of scaled the events down a little bit and kind of changed the tone of events because we were just looking to bring out a smaller class,” Ribot said. “The events were a little bit less outwardly social and a little bit more geared towards getting to know the brothers, getting to chill in a pretty relaxed setting and meet a lot of guys.”Jack C. Smith ’15, vice president of Sigma Chi, said his fraternity must limit the size of its pledge class due to logistics.“We can’t take everyone who shows up,” Smith said. “The process is open until the end, but we do have to make cuts.”Smith said that Sigma Chi is pleased with its new pledges.“The new class coming in, they’re all terrific guys,” he said.—Brian C.

The expansion of instant replay has been a hot topic in baseball over the past couple of years, and it appears as if the proponents of expanded instant replay are winning, by a large margin. It’s not just casual baseball fans, either: according to Fangraphs, the online baseball statistics Bible, those that describe themselves as watching twenty or more baseball games a month are <a href=""http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/fans-want-more-instant-replay-but-does-mlb-care/"">significantly more likely to support instant replay than those that watch five or fewer.  Perhaps the issue is with Fangraphs’ viewer base, but it still resonates that only fourteen percent of respondents were neutral to or in opposition of the idea of instant replay. It appears as if the use of expanded replay is an inevitable outcome. Expanded replay, however, is a bad idea for the sport. There are two main concepts that proponents of instant replay refer to: fairness, and general enjoyableness of the game.The issue of fairness is justifiable. In 2010, Armando Galarraga <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp%3Fymd=20100602%26content_id=10727590"">lost a perfect game with two outs in the ninth inning due to a blown call. Ask him what he thinks about limited replay, and the response is unlikely to be positive. Ask a manager what he thinks about instant replay after a blown call loses him the game, and you are guaranteed a similar reaction.The thing about instant replay, though, is that it is not inherently fair. The better team does not necessarily win every game, nor does the lesser team necessarily benefit from instant replay. This is why baseball is played out over a 162-game season: to reduce variability in outcomes. This is also why baseball conducts its playoffs over multiple series rather than in single games.Furthermore, baseball has not necessarily been moving toward a “fairer” system. Before the 2012 season, the very owners that voted in favor of expanded replay also voted in favor of expanding the playoff field from eight teams to ten, implementing a new wild card in each league. This serves only to dilute the playoff field and make it easier for inferior teams to win in October. The new system implements a play-in game between the two wild cards in each league, whereby the winner advances to the traditional division series and the loser goes home. By foregoing the series structure, this gamebecomes nothing more than a toss-up between the two teams, with luck playing a managerial role in determining which one ends up in the division series.This new system is not, in and of itself, fair. And yet, baseball decided to make the move toward it, because the new system offered <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp%3Fymd=20120104%26content_id=26259582%26vkey=news_mlb%26c_id=mlb"">far more drama than the old. When asked about the new system during the 2012 playoffs, Commissioner Bud Selig said he didn’t know “<a href=""http://m.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2012/10/15/Leagues-and-Governing-Bodies/MLB-playoffs.aspx"">how it could work out any better than this.”<span style=""color: #ff0000;""><span style=""text-decoration: line-through;""> Indeed, the excitement created by the new system more than offset any arguments about “fairness.”
Instant replay, at its heart, undermines the integrity of the sport. This applies to more than just baseball—in 2005, the then-general secretary of FIFA Urs Linsi <a href=""mailto:http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=104/edition=9102/news/newsid=98070.html"">said about expanded replay in soccer, “football’s human element must be retained. It mirrors life itself and we have to protect it.”<span style=""color: #ff0000;""><span style=""text-decoration: line-through;""> At their hearts, sports are controlled by human nature. For that reason, we have banned performance-enhancing drugs: We want our competitions to reflect the best and worst of human performance. Though we <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_NFL_referee_lockout"">don't tend to give umpires the respect they deserve, their role as impartial arbiters does not imply they be correct, or anything more than simply human.Part of the joy of debating about baseball is that you can’t always reach a sensible conclusion. We can reasonably state that the Houston Astros are probably worse than the Washington Nationals, but we cannot definitively state that the Baltimore Orioles were a better baseball team than the Tampa Bay Rays last year, even though we know for a fact that the Orioles made the playoffs and the Rays did not. Banning instant replay adds another layer to mystery: if it hadn’t been for that blown call, what would have happened? What team was better?We can’t know for certain. And that’s the thing: we love sports, but we love talking about sports just as much. When our team wins because of darned luck, or a blown call, we don’t care, because we’re the champions. But if we lose, we feel vindicated by luck or other factors. The Red Sox didn’t make the playoffs because of Bobby Valentine, and <a href=""http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp%3Fymd=20121005%26content_id=39509938%26c_id=mlb"">the infield fly rule cost the Braves their season.Yes, ideally we would like the best team to win every year. But that’s boring. Besides, if umpires can view instant replays, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias"">who are we going to blame when we lose?Julian Atehortua ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, is an economics concentrator in Leverett House.

With the Harvard men’s squash team knotted up with Princeton, 4-4, in the national semifinals, junior Gary Power stepped onto the court with his team’s hopes on his back.After losing to the Tigers, 4-5, the last time the two teams faced off, the Crimson had four players who lost in the last matchup score victories for the team on Saturday. However, when junior Ali Farag dropped the first match of his collegiate career at No. 1 and Power quickly fell behind, 2-0, in his match, the Crimson was 11 points from defeat.But Power rose to the occasion for Harvard, rallying to win the final three sets, and catapult his team into the tournament finals.“I’ve only been here three seasons but that was the biggest moment I’ve ever seen,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “That moment will never be forgotten. Farag had taken a big loss and our captain was out with an injury, and so at that time we were not looking good at all. For [Power] to come out and do what he did was absolutely heroic.”Power said that with so many people watching the match—he was the team’s final match on Saturday—he narrowed his focus on the court in front of him and blocked out outside distractions.
“I was just trying to get back and push us into the final,” Power said. “With so many other people riding on it, I was keeping my head in the game and trying to focus on making shots. That helped more than anything else.”Way said that even when Power fell down two sets, he was confident in the junior’s ability to come back. The coach said that Power’s fitness and mental fortitude was key in the victories in the final three sets, and that the moment he got down, he told the other coaches that all Power needed was to take one set to get back into the match.“He’s probably the fittest guy in college squash,” Way said. “There’s nobody more determined, and if you put determination in a beast like that, you’re going to get something quite awesome. You have to have intense concentration to do it for that long, many rallies are 60 to 80 shots and the concentration has to be there.”Freshman Jake Matthews said that Power has been an inspiration to him in his first season on the team, demonstrating diligence off the court and inspiring confidence on it.“Gary’s the kind of kid that you know will always push you and you know he will never give up,” Matthews said. “He’s a leader and a role model on the team. He has exceptional work ethic and determination and he’s the kind of guy you always want playing in the last match that you can count on to pull through.”Although Power, who used to play No. 1 for the team, has slipped down the ladder to play No. 4, Way said that the junior has done a terrific job in reshaping and improving his game over the past two seasons.“He’s been working on trying to change some aspects of his games and he has been changing it to get a bit more tactical,” Way said. “He has had a tough season [but] the basic structure of his game has improved a lot. He’s a very determined guy and a very hard working guy. He’s really paid some attention to detail and he’s gotten better and better.”Looking to next year, the team will graduate both co-captains Jason Michas, who was injured during the national championships, and Zeke Scherl. The team has improved its finish in each of the last three years, going from fifth in 2010 to third in 2011 to national runners-up in 2012. Farag said he felt confident about the team’s status for next year.“I think nobody will want to play against us [next year],” Farag said. “I know how hard it will be, knowing that the captains will graduate. We are getting some good recruits, however, and we were much more professional this year and we will be much better and more professional next year.”—Staff writer David P.

When a Harvard student anonymously published an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/anonymous-schizophrenia-help/"">op-ed in Thursday’s edition of The Crimson detailing the College’s failures in dealing with their mental illness, mental health issues took center-stage at Harvard. On the same day that the article was published, Paul J. Barreira, Director of Harvard University Health Services, introduced a series of new <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/22/mental-health-new-barreira/"">initiatives concerning stress and mental health. In a show of support for substantive change, more than 150 students <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/22/mental-health-yard-rally/"">rallied in front of Massachusetts Hall on Friday, proclaiming that, “Harvard can do better.”As Thursday’s anonymous op-ed makes clear, the mishandling of a mental health case can have horribly damaging effects. The administration should revise University policies so that no student suffering from mental illness—including those on substantial financial aid—is ever pushed into a corner where treatment is difficult to obtain or prohibitively costly. All students should be able to receive counseling if they need it, and no student should hesitate to get help for fear that their financial aid might be jeopardized. Furthermore, there must be a safety net—a mental health emergency fund, perhaps—that ensures that students suffering from mental illness who cannot return home due to a precarious family situation are provided for. We cannot afford to discourage students from receiving treatment for fear that they would be forced to return to a home that is not conducive to their betterment.Thankfully, Harvard seems at least to be cognizant of the need for more counseling opportunities on campus. According to Barreira, the hiring of more psychiatrists will mean that students will have quicker and easier access to the treatment they need. Other programs, such as a peer education group, will also help students cope with mental illness. These measures are certainly steps in the right direction and will hopefully send a message to students that they need not suffer alone.The University should also authorize changes to its financial aid system and to its policies concerning medical leave, which appear to have been so egregiously damaging to the anonymous writer’s experience. The top levels of University administration must establish policies that coordinate the actions of financial aid, HUHS, and any other relevant offices to ensure that from now on mentally ill students on full financial aid are able to receive the treatment they need without fear of being sent away. If students like Thursday’s op-ed writer are too afraid of jeopardizing their place at the College to step forward and get help, their condition will never be ameliorated, and they may even become a danger to themselves or others. The College would then be at fault for their suffering, having stood by policies that intimidate students in need rather than help them proactively.HUHS’ announced measures toward improving mental health at Harvard are positive steps. It remains deplorable, however, that any student could have gone through the ordeal experienced by the author of Thursday’s op-ed, and Harvard needs to address the failings that led to that ordeal. Students should be able to seek help without fearing for their financial aid or even their enrollment at the College. Any university should make an honest effort to prioritize the well-being of its students, mentally or otherwise. To that end, enacting some serious reform is the only responsible thing for Harvard to do.

Jews love a good argument, and I am no exception, so when I saw the “Open Hillel” petition, I quickly signed it. The appeal, <a href=""http://harvardpja.blogspot.com/2013/01/press-release-pja-launches-open-hillel.html"">begun by the Progressive Jewish Alliance, would allow Hillel-affiliated groups to co-sponsor events on site with all campus organizations, provided they are not anti-Semitic or racist. According to Hillel International’s current Israel guidelines, Hillel <a href=""http://www.hillel.org/israel/guidelines.htm"">will not “partner with, house, or host organizations, groups, or speakers that ... deny the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish and democratic state; ... delegitimize, demonize, or apply a double standard to Israel; ... or support boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions against (BDS) the State of Israel.”Here, those regulations have been interpreted loosely. Last year, Harvard Hillel <a href=""http://hillel.harvard.edu/events/2012/04/04/beinart-shrage"">sponsored an event with Peter A. Beinart, a liberal Zionist supportive of a West Bank settlement boycott. In 2010, a former member of Fatah <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/4/13/both-skolnick-sarah-palestinian/"">spoke here. Two years earlier, Hillel<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/7/repairing-the-silence-currently-on-display/""> hosted an anti-occupation art exhibit. Other Hillels, unfortunately, have not been so generous.Judaism is a big-tent religion, and we should be open to reasonable dissenting voices. Anti-Zionism is not inherently anti-Semitic. Classical Reform ideology, universalist and assimilationist, <a href=""http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/pittsburgh_program.html"">rejected the construction of Jewishness as an ethnic identity. In keeping with Marxist thought, Hadash, Israel’s Communist party, believes the country should be a state of its citizens rather than of the Jews. Harvard Hillel should bear this in mind as it crafts its own co-sponsorship policy. In the name of free and open discourse, it should discard Hillel International’s rules, save one: the ban on speakers and organizations that support BDS, a movement whose golemish Jew-hatred would be apparent to anyone, even the schlemiels of Chelm.BDS is rejectionism repackaged as anti-occupation activism. Like Arafat and Nasser, the movement denies a Jewish right to self-determination. BDS, however, avoids “drive them into the sea” declamation, seeking to destroy Israel by delegitimizing its cultural, commercial, and intellectual life. Not that it takes a tzadik to find explicit anti-Semitism within the movement. Just visit its website, like I did. One prominently featured item <a href=""http://www.pacbi.org/etemplate.php?id=2107"">was titled, “Zionism and Antisemitism: Racist Political Twins,” and it accused Zionists of Nazi collaboration. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of BDS’s leading lights, <a href=""http://blog.adl.org/international/desmond-tutu-endorsement-of-bds-veers-into-religious-anti-semitism"">said that by continuing the occupation of the West Bank, Jews “refused to listen” to God, as in times past when they “disobeye[d]” him, a poorly veiled reference to the crucifixion of Christ, the basis of Christian anti-Semitism.One could argue that the international BDS movement and its Harvard affiliate, the Palestine Solidarity Committee, are not closely associated. But that’s not true. I attended—and walked out of—the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/8/hillel-israeli-palestinian-event/"">event P.J.A. was prevented from hosting at Hillel, the spark of this entire controversy. Called “Jewish Voices Against the Occupation” and co-sponsored with P.S.C., the discussion quickly degenerated into a tirade against the Jewish state, which was charged with accusations of apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. The first two claims are inaccurate. The third invokes the specter of the Holocaust, a vile comparison with anti-Semitic undertones.
The materials on P.S.C.’s website are more troubling, specifically the organization’s <a href=""http://www.harvardpsc.com/veritas-handbook/"">Veritas Handbook. Billed as “a guide to understanding the struggle for Palestinian human rights,” its 347 pages, each stamped with the international BDS logo, are ahistorical propaganda filled with glib dismissals of Muslim and Arab anti-Semitism. The handbook also indulges in conspiracy theories, alleging that Mossad operatives, not government-sanctioned campaigns of violence and terror, were responsible for the exodus of Jews from Arab lands.Since the handbook was published in 2010, it’s possible that many members of the P.S.C. are not even aware of its existence, and I do not think they are anti-Semitic. However, the BDS watermark’s presence in the handbook suggests that the P.S.C. supports a Jew-bashing organization and subscribes to a narrative of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shot through with anti-Semitism. As P.J.A. has observed, many Palestinian groups support international BDS, which means that Hillel’s guidelines effectively exclude the Palestinian perspective.That’s not our fault. Pluralism has limits, and Hillel should not accommodate hate. If P.S.C. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/12/14/oren-harvard-students-crimes/"">truly values dialogue, it must reject the anti-Semitism in its midst.Daniel J.

When I found out that the International Olympic Committee decided to <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/ioc-drops-wrestling-2020-olympics-111816483--oly.html"">drop wrestling from the 2020 Olympics, I blinked, told someone to pinch me, blinked, told someone to punch me, and then peered outside to see whether unicorns were rollerblading down Dunster Street.They weren’t, so I knew this was for real. Next, I fired up Chrome and witnessed the online campaign that was unfolding in a machine-gun burst of tweets: #saveolympicwrestling. #saveolympicwrestling. #saveolympicwrestling.Why in Zeus’s name was an Olympic fixture since 708 B.C.E. suddenly nixed? Has the Olympic mission to celebrate sport imploded? (More on this later; the short answer is yes.)Apparently, the International Olympic Committee was deciding between cutting wrestling and cutting modern pentathlon. Modern pentathlon, which involves shooting, horseback riding, fencing, and swimming (although not all at once, alas) seeks to mimic the skills required of a nineteenth century cavalry officer.(Protests abound for modern pentathlon itself to be replaced by ultramodern pentathlon, which would simulate the skills of a 21st century tank commando in Baghdad. I’ve also heard requests for Call-Of-Duty Pentathlon.)
The IOC claimed that wrestling was phased out partly due to floor-hugging ratings. According to its <a href=""http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-executive-board-recommends-25-core-sports-for-2020-games/190772"">statement, the IOC examined all the sports on nearly forty criteria, such as TV views and popularity, “to ensure the Olympic Games remain relevant to sports fans of all generations.” So wrestling was just unpopular, like the last kid picked for kickball during recess.This can’t be the whole story. Wrestling has <a href=""http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/story/_/id/8939185/ioc-drops-wrestling-2020-olympics"">federations in 177 countries, while modern pentathlon has federations in only 108. Many countries in Eastern Europe and central Asia see wrestling as their national sport. This past summer, 71 nations sent wrestlers to London, and only 26 sent modern pentathletes. Moreover, modern pentathlon averages 12.5 viewers globally, whereas wrestling reels in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/opinion/how-wrestling-lost-the-olympics.html?_r=0"">twice that amount.As in every tragicomedy in which icy data subverts the fronted story, the usual suspect makes a cameo appearance: politics. As the <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-juan-antonio-samaranch-modern-pentathlon-20130212,0,1157345.story"">LA Times reports, the son of a former IOC president and current member of the executive board, Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., is also vice president of the International Modern Pentathlon Union.In any case, here’s the clinch: the decision to etch wrestling off the Olympic program doesn’t just hurt sports fans across the world. It also corrupts the Olympian mission. Instead of celebrating athleticism for its own sake, the athletic festival panders to popularity polls; instead of glorifying what is difficult and hard, it chases ratings. The IOC’s decision to cut wrestling shouldn’t concern just wrestlers; it should concern us all.What is more, the IOC decision reflects how the digital bricolage we call modernity shifts the athletic landscape. Press coverage converges on a select squadron of athletes, usually runners and swimmers and basketball players, who participate in sports the average family of 2.59 can understand (ball goes into net = win). Sports, like wrestling, that are suffused with techniques opaque to non-initiates are doomed to the bench. They are tweeted less. Worshipping Internet hit counts and commercialism refracts our perceptions about which sports are worth showing.All this is well and good, except that the purpose of the Olympics was never about online ratings. Were ancient Thebans live-tweeting the latest minotaur-slaying contest? Do you think Milo of Croton—the ancient Greek wrestler who supposedly carried a bull on his shoulders before slaughtering it and scarfing it down in one day—gave a mite that his Olympic match didn’t crack YouTube’s top ten? Well, he told me he didn’t. A central purpose of the original Olympics was to celebrate athleticism just for the sake of athleticism, and there is something downright pure about that.In fact, it’s still a central pillar of the modern Olympics, which is supposed to “oppose any commercial abuse of sport.” That last quote comes from rule 1.2.10 of the <a href=""http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf"">IOC charter.All of which is why we need wrestling back on the Olympic program. The IOC’s decision to drop wrestling is up for reversal in both May and September, and every second beats worriedly for this grandfather clock of sports. Let’s honor the Olympic ideal by recognizing that the purpose of the ancient events is not to push us forward through the age of modern media, but rather to bring us back to a time when none of that stuff mattered anyway.In the meantime, I better go post this on twitter. #saveolympicwrestling.Gregory D.

It takes a lot for any varsity athlete to make his or her comeback. It takes even more to do it again. However, for junior Jasmine Evans of the Harvard women’s basketball team it was the only way for her to stop “feeling like [she’d] been robbed.”Evans was originally recruited for the Class of 2013 as a versatile guard with enormous athletic potential. But this potential was not seen during her freshman year, as she tore her ACL during preseason practice. Evans sat out her entire first season, deprived of any game time.Evans returned to the court her sophomore year and proved a valuable asset to the team, averaging 3.3 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. She netted her current career-highs during that season, including a particularly strong game at Holy Cross where she netted 12 points, going 5-for-7 from the charity stripe.“We were curious to see what her court IQ was going to be as a sophomore and what her condition as a college player was going to be,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says. “She was phenomenal. She was first guard off the bench.”But injuries soon plagued Evans again. A broken hand, a broken foot, a concussion and more knee troubles stopped Evans in her tracks at the end of her sophomore year. Facing another knee surgery that summer, Evans decided to take the next year off to heal and stay healthy.
The Menlo Park, Calif. native returned home and spent the fall semester resting.“I didn’t need to push anymore,” Evans says. “I had to sit down, relax and just let everything heal.”As time went on, she made it back to the floor to regain her strength and previous level of talent.“Around springtime, I was back in the gym shooting, running, doing whatever I could to get back in shape and get back to where I was before I got injured,” she says. “It was definitely hard not to be able to play with other college girls during that time. I went to my high school a lot and practiced with my high school team.”Her return to basketball wasn’t just physical—Evans spent her free time watching the game on television and in person, regaining her intuitive sense for the sport. Described by Delaney-Smith as someone for whom “the sky’s the limit as to what she can do because of her athleticism”, Evans credits her time off for some of this basketball IQ.“I feel like I am smarter at the game of basketball, just from watching it and sitting out my freshman year,” Evans says. “Being gone for a year and watching it every single day, I’ve learned a lot about the game, being able to read players and being able to figure out how the game is developing as it goes along.”Back in Cambridge this year, she’s seen game time in all 23 of the squad’s games thus far. While she puts up an average of 3.3 points per contest, Evans’ strength remains in her defensive abilities.“She’s probably one of our strongest defenders on the ball,” Delaney-Smith says. “[And] she’s actually one of toughest defenders off the ball… She’s very scrappy…. She knows when to go to the ball, she knows when to take charges and she knows how to shut someone down.”Still, the nature of her injuries has changed her playing style. Unable to run as fast as she once could and more cautious of hard cuts to the basket because of her knees, Evans admits a new focus on “other skills like shooting, dribbling and being able to be put in a point guard position.”But her basketball comeback concerns even more than the actual sport. The new member of the Class of 2014 has had adjust to a new team dynamic and the return to academics. She has coped with the arrival of two new classes of players and the challenges of the classroom.“The first month, it was a little hard, but the girls on the team are so great,” Evans says. “They make that transition very easy.”Evans remains unique as a one of just a few female athletes at Harvard who has taken a mid-career gap year and, even more notably, made the journey back to her sport. Her resilience comes from a true love for the game and the dedication to her teammates. Evans felt that coming back at just 50 percent would deny her the opportunity to help her team in the way that her peers and coaches would want.“Most likely for women, they’re not going to pursue being a professional athlete,” Evans says. “Losing that one year makes a big difference because you may or may not play after college…. I thought the best decision was to take a year off, grow, get healthy, and come back and be stronger as a better player.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

With less than four minutes remaining in the match, junior midfielder Kyleigh Keating fed the ball to freshman attack Alexis Nicolia, who drilled into the back of the net, registering her fifth goal of the season-opening game. But in the final minutes of the match, the No. 17 Harvard women’s lacrosse team was unable to close its five-goal deficit and eventually fell to Stanford, 18-13, on the road on Sunday.The Crimson (1-0) came out strong at the opening whistle, as Nicolia netted two quick goals in the opening half to earn a quick Harvard lead. The season-opener was the first match of Nicolia’s collegiate career.“It was really nerve-racking,” Nicolia said. “We had a couple scrimmages, so I kind of just acted like it was a scrimmage so it wouldn’t get in my head too much…. I guess it worked.”The Cardinal (1-1) answered with two goals, tying the score at 2-2 five minutes into the opening period.“I think our biggest problem was our composure,” Nicolia said. “I think we got really nervous, and we let them get in our heads because they were really loud. It was our first game and we were on their field…. I think our composure fell a little bit.”
Junior midfielder Kasey Uhlenhuth regained the lead for the Crimson after registering a goal off of an assist from Keating in the 7th minute.“We had a lot of assisted goals, which is something we’ve been working on the past few years actually,” captain midfielder Micaela Cyr said. “Most of our goals were off of assists, which was great, being able to work together and really connecting.”Harvard then headed into a scoring drought while the Stanford offense recorded three consecutive goals, securing a two-goal lead at 5-3.Freshman attack Audrey Todd scored off an assist from Cyr, her second assist of the match. Todd then netted a free position goal to even the score.“I think we did come out strong, and I think we hustled a lot,” Nicolia said. “It was a very tiring game, and we were doing a lot of running. I think we did keep up with them most of the time, and our hustle was really high.”With twelve minutes remaining in the first frame, Nicolia found the back of the net to bring the score to 6-5 in the Crimson’s favor. The Cardinal again tallied three consecutive goals to head into halftime leading, 8-6.Stanford scored the first point of the second period after sophomore midfielder Rachel Hinds executed a free position goal. Keating answered with a goal of her own less than two minutes later, but Stanford executed its third three-goal streak of the game, grabbing a five-goal lead with the score at 12-7.“One of the things we struggled with was turnovers,” Cyr said. “We had way too many turnovers, which is something we can definitely improve on, so we’ll definitely be working on that in practice.”Cyr decreased the Crimson’s deficit to four points after senior midfielder Danielle Tetreault fed her a pass in the eighth minute. Stanford’s freshman Meg Lentz completed a hat trick less than a minute after Cyr’s goal, extending the Cardinal’s lead to 13-8.“Especially in the second half, [Stanford was] able to control most of the draws, which made it hard to stop them,” Cyr said.

Iceage are missing a space in their name, but the Danish band’s particular brand of punk rock thrives on a lack of space to breathe. The words “ice age,” although denotative of a frozen eon, here suggest an unavoidably stark honesty that lead vocalist Elias Rønnenfelt can’t seem to express with enough urgency. As such, it is a desperate fury that drives Iceage’s latest release, “You’re Nothing,” which follows their debut as another electrifying tribute to punk rock that maintains a sense of vehemence and earnestness while still showcasing the group’s talent.With the exception of “Interlude,” all the tracks on “You’re Nothing” seem to rush forward in a race against time—the album is a continuous journey through Rønnenfelt’s troubled mind, which always seems to have more to say than the short tracks allow. “Pressure, pressure, oh, God, no!” Rønnenfelt pleads in “Ecstasy,” the frantic cry of a young man overwhelmed by the sheer volume of what he has to say.This sense of frenetic immediacy is often dictated by drummer Dan Nielsen, whose complex snare rhythms and fiery fills act as the album’s propane. Especially on short, energetic tracks like “Rodfæstet,” Nielsen’s commanding pulse gives velocity and backbone to the sound. This irrepressible forward momentum is counterbalanced by the lack of a real thematic arrival. The band seems to search frantically but unsuccessfully for a way to explain itself—either lyrically or melodically—in the little time that it has. By the time Iceage reaches the penultimate “Awake,” Rønnenfelt sounds almost defeated as he declares, “We’re running out of time.”Although it is difficult to discern the impetus for the album’s rushed feel, the lyricism reveals that “You’re Nothing” is first and foremost a work of personal frustration. “Morals” opens with the introspective lines, “These songs, they never reach far enough / These shoulders never strike wide enough.” This feeling of inadequacy originates in the album’s aggressively dejected title and manifests itself throughout the album in plaintive vocals and searching lyrics. “It all comes down to shame / And any sense of distance,” Rønnenfelt cries on “Wounded Hearts,” sounding disappointed in himself and his lack of self-worth. By the time he shouts, “That’s why you’re nothing” on the title track, which concludes the album, the line sounds unmistakably like a self-accusation.Imperfections on the album contribute, rather than detract, from Iceage’s earnest sound. In fact, much of the appeal of “You’re Nothing” lies in these captivatingly human elements, a nod towards the traditional “do-it-yourself” nature of punk rock albums. Rønnenfelt’s shouts aren’t always perfectly on pitch, even for shouts, and the timing at the end of “Morals” between the guitar and the snare drum phases in and out of sync. Instead of devaluing the album, these small defects make “You’re Nothing” a uniquely approachable addition to the genre.
But what sets Iceage’s newest release apart from many other punk rock albums is the truly exceptional musical talent that lies under the aggressive layer of punk fury and musical imperfections. The full-frontal guitar attack is tasteful and at times intricate, such as on “Burning Hand,” when an almost imperceptible guitar line ornaments the traditional sea of distorted sound. At other times, these guitar lines are inexplicably catchy, creating a surprising pop feel on “Wounded Hearts” and “Awake.” Throughout the album, Rønnenfelt also demonstrates his vocal versatility, sounding sweet and warm on “Morals” and then uncontrollably vicious on “It Might Hit First.” Although the vocals never lose their edge, a tinge of wistfulness creeps in at all the right moments, coloring the vocals’ timbre in a way that provides an emotive depth to the album.Much to their credit, Iceage have managed to maintain their devastatingly aggressive sound while writing some of the most compelling and fresh music to come out of the genre in decades. The resultant “You’re Nothing,” although produced in high fidelity and teeming with talent, is not just a record for punk rock fans—it’s a record for punk rock. It may be too early to call Iceage the band that will revive punk, but their aptitude doesn’t get in the way of the elements that make their latest release an homage to the genre that Tommy Ramone called “pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock ‘n’ roll.”

“Performer with Cirque Du Soleil” is a rare credit to see on most resumes, but for Jon L. Morris, it is just one of many jobs he has taken on over his eclectic and extensive performance career. Morris has done everything from acting in a short film featured at the Sundance festival to performing in the Tony Award-winning company Theatre de la Jeune Lune to touring with the internationally acclaimed show “Fuerza Bruta.”Recently, he started his own performance collective, The Windmill Factory, and was awarded the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study movement theater with Philippe Gaulier, a famous French clown and professor of theater. On Thursday, Morris will teach a master class on the basics of physical theater at the Harvard Dance Center. No dance or performance experience is required; Morris recommends that students dress to move, be ready to have a great time, and “check their Veritas at the door.“The Harvard Crimson: What kind of performances do you create with the Windmill Factory?Jon L. Morris: We just did a 15-minute shadow play on the side of a castle wall in Cartagena, Colombia, for a one-night, 500-person dinner. The shadow play…was on this massive castle with a wall that was 60 feet by 300 feet. We had massive projectors and moving lights…. We also had some of the best acrobats I had ever worked with on that show. Just the slightest adjustments of their bodies made the difference between seeing a frog at 60 feet or just a blob. Another wild one we did on a totally different medium was recreating the night sky on the Hudson River with solar-powered, wirelessly controlled LED lights in a piece called “Reflecting the Stars”…. So you could push a button and the Big Dipper would appear out on the water. It was raising awareness about light pollutionwithin our city…. Both [these examples] have this element of humanity and connectivity to the audience, and that’s the key for us. If we’re going to create an installation, people are going to be able to play with it and interact with it. If we’re going do a theater piece, we’re going to be in the audience and playing with the people.
THC: What will your collaborative performance and movement theater master class be like?JLM: The master class that I will be teaching next week is derived from various styles of theater that I have performed in and trained in all over the world, and that’s all the way from dance and Indian dance to traditions of clowning and Stanislavski acting technique to circus and athletics…. The biggest thing in the style of theater that I am most passionate about and will work with in my master class is that it is extremely connected emotionally with very motivated movements. It is never an abstract language. There is always a purpose to it. Even if the gesture is repeating in reverse five times and not necessarily something you would see everyday, it remains motivated in a way that connects to the story and helps tell the story. It has a purpose, and in that way all the gestures in a piece connect to the storyline and help push the piece along.THC: What has your experience been like with the show Fuerza Bruta?JLM: I came on as part of the original cast in New York City…. I toured to Taiwan, Brazil, [and] Israel. If someone asked me what the show was about, I’d just say, “Just come and see it,” and I’d try to give them as little information as possible. But if they insisted, I’d tell them it is an incredible theatrical experience that combines dance, theater, spectacle, and a party all in the same show.THC: How should audiences approach a show as avant-garde as Fuerza Bruta?JLM: One of the unique things about Fuerza Bruta is that Diqui James, the [show’s artistic director and] creator, really creates such beautiful, poetic images that are like moving paintings, and they have enough character and storyline for people to latch on to, but not enough to have one interpretation. In the four years that I was in Fuerza Bruta I must have heard thousands of interpretations of what different moments, or different characters, or what the whole thing meant. And that’s really the show’s greatest strength. So when people would ask me, “What does it mean?” I’d always return the question and ask, “What do you think it means?” and I’d almost always get a different answer.

On March 5, Memorial Church's organ recital series continues with a free and open to the public celebrity performance by acclaimed organist Nathan Laube, artist-in-residence at the American Cathedral in Paris. Having spent the past several years studying and performing in France and Germany, Laube embraces the new challenge brought by performing in an American colonial church. “What's so fascinating is coming to a new place where all of these foreign variables have been introduced,” he says. “Memorial Church is not a big French cathedral, a chamber music hall, or a little court with royalty adorning the sides of the building.... We have to really reinvent the music in a new space and within a new context.” The performance is part of a series inaugurating the pair of new organs Memorial Church acquired past two years. “I've spent hours and hours thinking about what to play in this venue and on these two organs,” Laube says. He has chosen pieces to fit the distinct personalities of Memorial Church's two instruments, he says. On the smaller, 1929 Skinner organ he will play German neoclassical composer Paul Hindemith's first organ sonata, written less than a decade after the instrument was built. “[The piece ] will give us an opportunity to hear all the subtle details, special effects, and little decadent colors you get with an organ that aspires to be more of a symphony orchestra than a classical pipe organ,” Laube says. For the newer Fisk organ he has selected a more eclectic program—Bach, Duruflé, and Mozart, among others—designed to showcase the instrument's tonal flexibility. “[The Fisk] allows you a greater degree of authenticity in terms of entering many different sound worlds within the context of one instrument,” Laube says. “You can get the illusion of a French organ [or] a large German baroque organ.”Laube will join the faculty of the University of Rochester’s Eastman School of Music in New York this fall. In addition to his concert, he will be teaching a master class for Harvard organ students at Memorial Church on March 3.

Welcome to ""Listen Up!,"" Flyby's weekly advice column, written by two jobless, washed-up seniors from their futon in Winthrop.We rounded up some of your most poignant questions from last week and responded with our unfailing wisdom. <!--more-->Q: I feel like I have difficulty making guy friends. Don't get me wrong. I love my girl friends. They're amazing. But I enjoy having the male perspective on conversations (not to mention having someone to take to events without the pressure). Any recommendations on good places and ways to make some new guy friends?
 A: Wait. So let us get this straight. You want to be in the friend zone? Fascinating. In our experience, the easiest way to make male friends is to tell a guy you've developed romantic feelings for him. It's a sure-fire way to becoming ""just friends.""But if romantic humiliation isn't what you’re after, we recommend using your extracurriculars to boost your resume and your social life. Think about joining a club with a more masculine vibe. Or take advantage of living in co-ed dorms and try attending entryway study breaks, joining your HoCo, and playing IM sports. If all else fails, pretend you're super into video games. N.B. If you are having a hard time making guy friends because you're hot and all the guys you meet fall in love with you, we don't have any advice for you. This is not a problem. Congrats on your awesome life. Q: It's my senior spring and I am suffering from serious FOMO. It's my last chance to be in college and I'm constantly running around trying to make sure I don't miss out on anything—senior bar, Ghungroo senior dance, spending time with all of my friends, etc. I know I need to chill out, but what if I end up missing out on something awesome?A: First of all, you’re a senior. It's time to stop using Twitter acronyms. You think that's going to fly at the investment bank you're starting at in four months? No, no it is not. Secondly, calm down. Senior bar can be fun, but let's be real, making small talk with that kid who lived in your freshman year entryway isn't fun. Pace yourself. Remember, at the end of this semester there is an entire week dedicated to being with other seniors, and we suspect it will be about four days longer than it needs to be. You have plenty of time. Q: I'm beginning to realize that I'm likely never to find love in my life. Do you know of any good bargains on cats, particularly in bulk?

“New Blue and White,” a new exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, centers around blue and white porcelain, which was first created in 7th-century China, and remains today an iconic and familiar style. A new exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts highlights contemporary artists’ attempt to make this classic art form relevant and surprising in the 21st century. On view through July 14, the show comprises nearly 70 contemporary pieces of porcelain by over 40 artists. Blue and white is a term used in the Asian art field to describe a specific type of porcelain of cobalt-blue decoration painted under a clear gaze. There was much creative and artistic back-and-forth between ancient China and the Islamic world, which had access to extensive reserves of cobalt. Local potters in the Middle East learned how to emulate the styles of pottery that were being imported from China. The Mongolian invasion of the 13th century reinforced an aesthetic shift toward more ornamental blue and white style pottery. By the 14th century, the Chinese had perfected blue and white porcelain and started to mass produce it. Dutch Delftware and German Meissen ware represent later attempts to recreate Chinese porcelain. “Globalization is not entirely new, when you think about the way the blue and white travels,” says Emily Zilber, the MFA’s Ronald L. and Anita C. Wornick Curator of Contemporary Decorative Arts, who arranged this exhibition. “We certainly associate it with Asian ceramics, but blue and white has touched almost everybody around the globe.” This exhibition that deals with blue and white in an encyclopedic context—by linking works to other historically and artistically related works in the museum—rather than a straightforward gallery layout.  For example, there are seven artworks in the exhibition with labels leading visitors to related historical works in other parts of the MFA, artworks such as John Singer Sargent’s signature painting, “The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit,” which is a domestic scene framed by two Japanese blue and white vases. Kondô Takahiro one of the artists whose modern porcelain is on display, has created a contemporary vase that is a twist on a traditional vase that was created by Takahiro’s grandfather. Other artists’ pieces make statements about cultural exchange. “Prayer Stone II,” by Iranian artist Pouran Jinchi, applies of layers of lacquer on Shiite Muslim prayer stones that were brought from Iran by her brother and mother, representing and at the same time re-interpreting her cultural roots.For Dutch artist Gèsene Hackerberg, the use of blue and white porcelain is a way to rethink the Dutch tradition of delftware. Hackenberg has created a necklace out of delft platters. “Delft blue ware is very valuable here, but it’s also a national pride of the Dutch,” Hackenberg says. By upcycling the traditional Delft blue, “[Hackenberg has] simultaneously destroyed the platter because it is not functional as a platter anymore, but also allowed it to be a part of a new still life,” Zilber says.Some artists take the familiarity of blue and white objects and imbue broader meanings into them. Michelle Erickson, who is also currently a visiting artist at Harvard, took  inspiration from an 18th-century American porcelain pickle stand and creatively replicated it in a 21st-century style. “The original pickle stand was made by the first American forge. Porcelain in general was being produced in Europe at this point, so this pickle stand symbolizes the beginning of American independence,”  Erickson says. On top of this historical significance, Erickson has added motifs of conflict such as a broken grenade and gas nozzle, which represent the artifacts of the modern era. “As we are navigating the contemporary world, it’s always important to think about the past and how it impacts our actions, and realize [the] longer trajectory,” Zilber says, “This is an exhibition that speaks very particularly to that that productive tension between the past and the present.”

                        K-pop Generation
                    
</h2>
HistoryIt may come as a surprise that modern-day K-pop started in a country that once lacked its own pop culture. Hallmarks of the K-pop culture now include live concerts that sell out in minutes, platinum status digital and physical album sales, appearances of artists on television miniseries and talk shows, and glamorous magazine photo shoots. However, music was not always a commercial phenomenon or commodity.Just as American blues evolved into modern day mainstream pop, rock, and hip-hop music, “pansori”—or Korean opera sung along to a drum—was the cornerstone for what developed into K-pop. The commodification of Korean music began in the 1920s, with the first recordings of traditional pansori songs. In the 1930s and 40s, “trot” (also called “pong-jjak” in reference to its rhythmic beat)—a genre inspired by the popular Foxtrot dance tunes in the United States, took center stage. The public witnessed the rise of the first Korean recordings explicitly made for consumption.The arrival of foreign troops during the Korean War inevitably ushered in American trends and songs, which heavily influenced the next stages of the evolution of Korean pop culture. The first vestiges of rock came on the horizon in Korea with the massive popularity of the Rolling Stones and Elvis Presley. The arrival of rock ‘n’ roll in Korea also meant that contact with the outside world slowly began to open up. In the following decades—the 1960s and 1970s—groups such as the Beatles and the Eagles influenced the development of K-rock. The genre was perfectly suitable for the generation coming out of the ashes of war, working together to rebuild a nation.However, with the dictatorship of Park Chung-Hee, outside influence on the growing Korean pop culture came to a standstill and the country became insular. Popular music adopted a softer, less “rebellious” tone, setting the stage for music that blended softer strains of rock with R&amp;B and jazz. This led to ballads—songs marked not by a powerful beat or an exciting chord progression, but by a talented singer who can hold his or her own. Ballads have remained popular into the modern day, and now, every high-grossing Korean television drama miniseries is sure to include at least one ballad song. Some trademarks of ballads are a nostalgic vibe, sweet or sad lyrics (sometimes overly so), and quite often revolve around love (or lost love).
Riding on the tides of the 1988 Olympics, in Seoul, the 1990s brought democracy, the growth of artistic freedom, and the return of outside pop music influences as well as experimentation with music forms within Korea. Parallel with the rise of Michael Jackson, Madonna, and boy bands like the Backstreet Boys, so too came about the first vestiges of hip- hop, dance music, and boy bands in Korea. The song, “I Know (난 알아요)” by Seo Taiji and the Boys (서태지) ushered in the new era of K-pop. Seo Taiji and the Boys dominated the music charts, performed on television shows to ecstatic crowds, and drew a wide fan base. Thus, the modern Korean pop culture was officially born and management companies began to explore creative ways to produce K-pop artists that would draw fans both at home and abroad.A Snapshot of Old School K-pop RoyaltyH.O.T. (1996-2001) H.O.T. (aka High-Five of Teenagers), the original K-pop idols, was created to target a teenage audience. They successfully captured the hearts of fan girls and boys alike with songs about teenage angst and love. Member Tony An was scouted in LA by SM Entertainment, beginning the trend of K-pop groups often incorporating members from overseas. Popular song: “Candy.” S.E.S. (1997-2002)A bubblegum pop trio, they are regarded by many as the female H.O.T. Their group name comes from combining the initials of its members, Sea, Eugene, and Shoo. Popular songs: “Dreams Come True” and “Oh! My Love.”Fin.K.L. (1998-2002)In sharp contrast to the sweet pop songs of S.E.S., Fin.K.L sang soulful R&amp;B-infused ballads. Since disbanding, member Lee Hyori in particular has enjoyed an extremely successful career as a model, television show host, singer, and animal rights activist. Popular songs: “To My Prince (나의 왕자님께)” and “Forever Love (영원한 사랑).”Shinhwa (1998-Present)The longest-lived K-pop boy band, Shinhwa is still active and even hosts their own television talk show. Each member is also currently active as a solo singer, actor, or CEO of an entertainment company. Popular songs: “Eusha Eusha (으쌰으쌰),” “I Pray 4 U,” “Wedding,” and “Venus.”1TYM (1998-2006)A charismatic and energetic hip-hop group, 1TYM was the first hip-hop idol group. Member Teddy Park has become the most lucrative producer for hip-hop production giant YG Entertainment and member Danny Im, a California native, hosts a talk show on entertainment channel Mnet. Popular song: “One Love.”g.o.d. (1999-2006) Their name stands for “Groove Over Dose,” and they took the music scene by storm with groovy ballad “To Mother.” All members went solo after disbanding, and lead singer Kim Tae Woo is particularly well-known. Former member Yoon Kye Sang is now a famous actor. Popular songs: “To Mother (어머님께)” and “Lies (거짓말).”—Columnist Soy Kim can be reached at soyoungkim@college.harvard.edu.

If I could go back in time, I would return to any moment before I read Jane Austen’s “Persuasion.” Then, I’d have the entire novel ahead of me, patiently waiting just like central character Anne Elliot herself. If Anne could wait for her Captain Wentworth forever, “Persuasion” should wait for me forever. I’d want to save the pleasures of this particular Austen novel for the last moments of my life, rather than consuming it ravenously as I did at age 13.“Persuasion” was the last novel Austen wrote and was published after her death in 1817. It’s a painful tale of uncertain love; when Anne is young, she’s persuaded by her vain father and snobby Lady Russell to deny Captain Wentworth’s marriage proposal. Predictably—because this is early 19th-century England—Wentworth takes to the seas to drown his sorrows in the Navy. Eight years later Anne finds herself, at the ungodly age of 27, alone after having refused to fall in love with anyone else. Naturally, in the context of Jane Austen’s world, you’d expect the ending of “Persuasion” to be a second—and this time accepted—proposal from Wentworth, and that conclusion does indeed come. However, the novel is so submerged in Anne’s self-deprecating mind that it’s possible to forget the book is ultimately a Jane Austen creation. It is so submerged in Anne’s voice, which is both serious and eager that the tone of the novel strays noticeably from Austen’s other, more conversational novels. That is what separates “Persuasion” from from others such as “Emma” or “Pride and Prejudice.” This particular Austen is quieter, and it unravels at a patient, almost leisurely pace.The only place to read “Persuasion” is in a beanbag chair because sinking into an armchair is not quite as satisfying as the undulating, expansive nature of the beanbag. Submerged in the indented chair and in Anne Elliot’s mind, you forget that there’s a happy ending after all the insufferable evenings spent in parlor rooms. Austen is a master of discomforting her characters; her novels are a precursor to the visceral social awkwardness in the film “Bridesmaids.” Austen has a talent for seizing an uncomfortable situation, placing just the right number of characters in the room, and watching her protagonists squirm like worms on the sidewalk.  It’s the penetrating particularity of the phrases Austen chooses that cause us to sink deeper into the beanbag, confessions like “You pierce my soul” and “I am half agony, and half hope” and the nearly unspeakably true, “When pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.” Austen digs underneath our sense of decency, mucking up social formalities 200 years before my unbelievably awkward self ever entered the scene.Austen’s ability to articulate exactly the workings of Anne’s self-doubt is incredible; the text is not even written in the first person, and yet it is undoubtedly written from her perspective alone. In reading “Persuasion,” I felt a comforting interiority I had not sensed as much in her other novels. And Austen goes farther; she draws out the Anne’s uncertainty until the penultimate chapter. Even then, it is only an accidentally overheard conversation that prompts Wentworth to confess his steadfast love.I have never experienced so much physical relief and confusing joy while reading any other novel. I believe I sank below the outer edges of my beanbag chair when I read Wentworth’s confession; my feet were likely sticking above my head by the end of it all. I experienced many of the same emotions that Anne herself probably battled with after reading Wentworth’s letter. “I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach.” I was irrationally surprised, as if all the time I’d spent in the beanbag chair was actually time spent in Somersetshire and Bath; it had felt like eight years of waiting, and finally Anne and I were being rewarded by this love letter. I felt like a martyr.
So here is my logical proposition: wait until you are weeks from the end of your life, when you are wrinkled and your bones are more brittle than the pages of “Persuasion.” Only then should you pick up Austen’s last, and in my opinion, greatest novel. Then, having literally waited all of your life for this moment, when Chapter 23 comes around and Anne happens upon the letter, the carefully concocted feeling of liberation will be limitless.—Staff writer Virginia R. Marshall can be reached at virginiarosemarshall@college.harvard.edu.

A group of sixteen members of the Service Employees International Union Local 615 voiced support for the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers’ position in its contract negotiations in a letter sent to University President Drew G. Faust and Deputy Director of Labor Relations Susannah P. Scannell last Thursday.The 16 union members who signed the petition are grounds crew workers at the Arnold Arboretum, a Harvard arboretum that employs both HUCTW and SEIU workers.Nima Samimi, a grounds crew worker at the Arboretum and the SEIU shop steward, initiated the idea of sending the petition to show support for coworkers in HUCTW.“My interest and my concern in starting this petition was in building solidarity to strengthen the connection of the unions at Harvard,” Samimi said.HUCTW is currently engaged in its longest ever contract negotiations with the University. While the old contract between both sides expired July 1 of last year, the terms of a new contract have yet to be decided.
When asked for comment, a University spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that the University will maintain its focus on resolving the negotiations through mediation.“The University has successfully negotiated agreements with seven other unions at Harvard over the past two years and remains committed to reaching an agreement that is fair to employees represented by the HUCTW and to employees across the University as a whole,” the spokesperson said.Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for the SEIU Local 615, said that while his organization supports HUCTW’s position in the labor negotiations, it has not officially played any role in the negotiating process.HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that all the unions representing Harvard workers have close relationships with one another and that other unions have expressed support during the ongoing negotiations.“The efforts in solidarity between our workers have really only gotten better over the years, and I think that’s due to a lot of careful listening to each other and collaborative work to be sure that our strategic ideas are well-aligned,” Jaeger said.—Staff writer Christine Y. Cahill can be reached at christinecahill@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/cycahill"">@cycahill.

We were out on the beach playing with paddles, a game with a name I could never remember. Our young lives shone bright in that November sun. Adrian and I weren’t really that young, but I felt like I could live forever.A potbellied, life-weathered man yelled things we couldn’t understand from his seat on the sand a short distance away. His beat-up leather skin had been worn by the beach like driftwood in the sun. He was crazy, drunk, or high—maybe all three. His shouts were garbled by the waves and the wind. Our game was like the tide, pushing us in his direction. As his words became audible, we realized he’d been keeping score, the referee of a game that he hadn’t been invited to between two people he didn’t know. According to him, I was winning. He wanted to play. I felt vulnerable in my beachy near-nudity and Adrian was put off, so we moved in the other direction.The man got up and walked toward us. We looked at each other incredulously as he approached. Adrian instinctively took a defensive stance in front of me and attempted to tell this bum to piss off in the nicest way possible. He kept talking at us, though, adjusting his filthy cap and slipping shorts, asking to play the game with us. Adrian decided to entertain him.“Where you from, man?”“Chicago,” the stranger replied.
“That’s a beautiful city.”“How bout you guys?”“I’m from here. She’s from L.A,” Adrian replied. “What brought you to Miami?”“Work.”“What do you do?”“Electrician. Miami was good to me—then I lost my job.”“Sucks,” Adrian said sympathetically. “I’m sorry,” I said. “Maybe those girls will play with you.” The man turned around, seeing the topless girls behind him that he hadn’t noticed. He turned back to us, wide-eyed and flustered, and yelled a startled “Hey!”, the remark he used to mean just about anything—punctuation, stalling, surprise. He had trouble focusing on us. He looked back at the breasts on display and to us again. And suddenly, he asked if we were married.“Yeah.”“How long?”“Two years—and we still like each other.”

  The SFJAZZ Collective, a San Francisco-based jazz ensemble that has been celebrated from coast to coast for its innovation and talent, will be performing the music of jazz pianist Chick Corea at the Berklee Performance Center on March 8. This group, which is made up of eight experienced jazz musicians including Grammy nominee Miguel Zenón and Grammy winner David Sánchez, manages to attract fans from all walks of life with the wide breadth and diversity of experience represented by its members. “Because it’s the top guys on each instrument, if you’re an older jazz fan, you know who these guys are,” SFJAZZ publicist Marshall Lamm says. “If you’re a younger jazz fan or a younger musician…these are the guys you look up to. These are the guys whose solos you transcribe. These are they guys whose bands you want to be in.” Since its inception in 2004, the collective has attracted a group of performers that is both international and noteworthy; the current line up includes members from Venezuela, New Zealand, Israel, Puerto Rico, and the contiguous United States. “Jazz is a very international music, and [in this collective] you’ve got players from all over the world.... It’s a very international group,” Lamm says. While its members are all celebrated in their solo careers, they are each drawn to the democratic aspect of the SFJAZZ Collective. All performers hold an equal voice in the decisions of the collective, something that Lamm says is extremely rare in jazz. This democratic approach to jazz has a major influence on this tour’s set list. To create the set list, each member picked a favorite from Chick Corea’s four-decade repertoire, and from this eight-song selection the band will choose four songs every night to perform, along with three to four group originals. To the group’s excitement, the performance has already earned the admiration of Corea. “He has given his approval,” Lamm says. “He thinks it’s a heck of a concept.”

“Gravediggress”CocoRosie, “Tales of a Grass Widow”The Casady sisters, who perform as CocoRosie, defy any definition or genre. Since they released “La maison de mon reve” in 2004, they have been steadily tuning their experimental sound, relying on a range of eclectic tools that includes a harp and toy instruments. A nostalgic accordion refrain opens their new single, “Gravediggress,” creating a singsong melody which is complicated by an electronic rhythm and beatboxing. Into this mix, the sisters introduce their elusive vocals, mingling Bianca’s angelic solo and Sierra’s throaty interjections to create the unsettling effect that distinguishes CocoRosie as a phenomenal and unique band. “Gravediggeress” is an amorphous, enticing and otherworldly tune that marks the start of a challenging wait for CocoRosie fans until the release of the group’s album in May.“Retrograde”James Blake, “Overgrown”
On “Retrograde,” singer-songwriter James Blake’s yearning voice captures a sense of desperate loneliness as it emerges into an atmosphere of disconnected sounds. The deliberate intonation with which Blake utters each falsetto phrase constructs layers of sound that build in intensity until the breaking point before the last minute of the song. He then begins his signature Blake-ian humming, proving his aptitude as a vocalist and demonstrating that he cannot be pigeonholed in the genre of electronic music—he uses his voice too aptly and consciously for that. The vocal loops create an orchestra of multiple Blakes that compound the emotional impact of his lyricism as he croons, “We’re alone now,” and challenges the listener, “So show me where you fit.” “Retrograde” proves that James Blake is coming back to shake the electronic music world and keep redefining its limits and boundaries.   “Earthquake” The Uncluded, “Hokey Fright”Kimya Dawson and Aesop Rock’s newly released track “Earthquake,” off their collaborative album “Hokey Fright,” is repetitive and verbose even as it maintains its cutting wit. The playful tone of Dawson’s lyricism is juxtaposed with Aesop’s penchant for aggressive spoken word. The repeating arpeggio of the guitar sets the loping pace of the song. However, Dawson and Aesop’s collaboration is by and large ineffective—when they sing together, their voices create a cancelling effect that prevents the listener from absorbing more than one vocal line each listen. The listener has to either tune in to Aesop and ignore Kimya, or vice versa. Textural chaos and simplistic musical stylings mark the song as quirky and original, but “Earthquake” doesn’t present anything truly satisfying.

Some time in 1970—or it might have been 1969, details are a little sketchy—a little-known singer walked into De Luxe Studios in Cincinnati, cut one monster of a record, and then disappeared. Marie “Queenie” Lyons, whose album “Soul Fever” is one of the funkiest soul LPs ever to drop, sunk without a trace. She hasn’t recorded since.For a while in the late ‘60s, things seemed to be going Lyons’ way. She was a regular on the Chitlin’ Circuit—a network of venues across the country that catered to black performers and audiences—and was even hired by James Brown to be one of his “Funky Divas.” She released a couple of singles on De Luxe in 1969, a year before “Soul Fever” came out. But like so many talented performers before and since, Lyons couldn’t catch a break, and her incredible brand of hard-rocking R&amp;B has only been appreciated by soul-crazed audiophiles such as myself. That changes now.I could name about 6,000 reasons why I think it is a shame that so few people have heard of Lyons, but for me the most grievous one is that she perfectly captured the feel of the times. By the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, soul music had lost its happy-go-lucky charm and was rapidly evolving into hard-edged funk as the Black Power movement gained mainstream attention. In four short years, “Number 1 Soul Brother” James Brown had gone from singing about his baby’s “Good Good Lovin’” to exclaiming, “Say it Loud—I’m Black and I’m Proud.” Everything about Queenie Lyons, from her badass voice to her Angela Davis-style afro—exuded this sort of newfound confidence and power.“Soul Power” is full of fantastic soul-funk hybrids, but probably the best embodiment of the charisma and resilience of the era is her cover of the jazz standard “Fever.” Lyons’ version starts with breathy, spoken lyrics—an homage to the greats who recorded the song before her, such as Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee. However, about 10 seconds in, the saxophones lay down a funky line that leaves no doubt as to the direction the song is taking. By the the time the second verse rolls around, all pretense of jazz-age restraint is abandoned. Lyons sings, “Listen to me baby / hear every word I say / no one can love I like I do / because they don’t know how to love you my way” with such husky-voiced power and confidence, it seems more like a threat than a plea to a distracted lover. By the sound of it, if Queenie caught her man cheating, he’d be lucky if he got a three-second head start.Lyons’ vocal performance isn’t the only thing going for “Fever.” Her backing band lays down a tight, high-energy groove that perfectly complemented the song’s hard funk sound. The rhythm section chugs along during most of the verse, giving Lyons the space she needs to shine. However, every time the arrangement might start to drag, the saxophones burst in with their signature line—often signaling a key change up a half-step, which further adds to the song’s energy. The song never feels out of control; The band keeps its cool, and the result is a as good as anything recorded by James Brown or Sly and the Family Stone.

I personally don’t know what is worse: the fact that Marie “Queenie” Lyons only recorded one album, or the fact that the album she did record was left cruelly unappreciated for so long. “Soul Fever” should be considered one of the best albums of the early ‘70s, and Lyons should have been rewarded with a long career full of promising releases. But history doesn’t work that way. Due to a combination of small-label politics and a miniscule marketing budget, “Soul Fever” never got the release it deserved, and we are all poorer for it.—Columnist Noah S.

Part II of a two-part series examining how the looming cuts in federal funding could impact research at Harvard. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/25/university-braces-spending-cuts/"">Part I ran on Feb. 25.Anticipating unprecedented cuts in federal funding, researchers and administrators at Harvard are faced with the challenge of making ends meet.The looming cuts, known as sequestration, will be triggered automatically if lawmakers do not reach a budget agreement by March 1 and could cost Harvard millions of dollars in annual revenue.Regardless of what happens on Capitol Hill this week, Harvard will have to contend with decreased revenue from federal agencies by reevaluating its reliance on different sources of income.Marshaling the help of administrative offices, faculty members, and researchers across the University, Harvard is already exploring possible solutions.
“There are different ways in which we are planning for and responding to these changing circumstances,” said University President Drew G. Faust.Harvard’s solutions largely fall into two categories—cost-cutting by maximizing the efficiency of existing operations and revenue-generating by finding ways to stand out in what is an increasingly competitive pool of grant applicants and diversifying sources of sponsorship.Still, researchers worry that Harvard’s cost-cutting efforts may jeopardize their work and fear that Harvard’s revenue generating measures, particularly private sponsorship, may not be worth the attached strings.TIGHTENING THE BELTResearchers are exploring a variety of methods aimed at cutting spending in an effort to preempt the potentially unprecedented cuts to University federal funding. Last fiscal year <a href=""http://vpf-web.harvard.edu/annualfinancial/pdfs/2012fullreport.pdf"">Harvard received over $650 million from Washington.One of these solutions may be hiring fewer researchers in the future, according to Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology professor Jeffrey D. Macklis.“I’m thinking that if this is the trajectory of the federal budget...then perhaps I’m going to be a little less welcoming to that superstar from Germany, or that superstar from California,” Macklis said.According to the Office of Sponsored Programs’ annual report, compensation—including salaries, wages, and fringe benefits—comprised approximately 30 percent of Harvard’s total costs in fiscal year 2012.“If there’s less federal funding, the entire system will be able to support fewer investigators,” said assistant biology and computer science professor David D. Cox ’00.Cost-cutting may also take the form of reductions in significant equipment purchases. Many researchers have already begun to be more frugal in their expenditures.

   After a half-decade hiatus, the Boston chapter of the nonprofit Zigen Fund is again hosting a benefit concert, to take place at Sanders Theatre on March 3. Featuring a mix of international and local talents, the event celebrates the 2013 Lunar New Year. Proceeds will go towards the Zigen Fund’s mission to support the educational and social development of women and children in impoverished areas of rural China.Many artists who have previously performed for Zigen are returning to the stage, including international mezzo-soprano singer Guang Yang. A native of Beijing trained at its Central Conservatory of Music, Yang has extensive experience with Western opera and currently performs at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. She will be performing a wide range of music including, by special audience request, “I Love You, China,” a technically demanding classic in the Chinese canon that Yang previously performed at the 2008 Zigen Benefit Concert. Also returning to the stage is Maxwell Li, a graduate of Boston’s New England Conservatory and winner of the prestigious Luciano Pavarotti International Vocal Competition. Li will be performing a duet from Giacomo Puccini’s “La bohème,” among other pieces.
Other performers include local singer Xiaoyi Duan, who owns the Sichuan Garden restaurant in Brookline; Jing Wei, the winner of the Metropolitan Opera House Vocal Music Contest Prize; and the North American Chorus Association, a Boston music organization. Rounding out the list of performers is Liwen Wang, another returning performer and graduate of the New England Conservatory. Wang will be performing two arias, one by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and the other by Czech composer Antonín Dvořák.This group of performers, as well as the humanitarian mission of the event, make the concert a unique chance to experience the musical talents of the Chinese-American community.  “[This sort of concert is] hard to find among the Chinese community, so I encourage everyone to come and listen,” Wang says.<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> <p style=""font-weight: bold;""> <p style=""font-weight: bold;"">

Junior Gary Power and the Harvard Men’s Squash team clinched the victory in the CSA semifinals on Saturday, earning him the title as Athlete of the Week. Here in Cambridge, however, some other Crimson athletes were able to compete to a level good enough to merit recognition by The Back Page as Athlete of the Week Runners-Up.<a name=""jump"">
 
Adabelle Ekechukwu, Women’s Track and Field 
 
For the first time since 2000, the women’s track and field team was victorious in this year’s Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. Junior co-captain thrower Ekechukwu broke the 2002 record for women’s weight throwing by more than two meters on the first day of competition with a 20.83-meter throw. Additionally, Ekechukwu was awarded the Field Most Outstanding Performer award by the Ivy League this weekend.
Nico Weiler, Men’s Track and Field
Weiler beat his personal best and 2012 meet record of 5.3 meters in Saturday’s meet when the senior pole vaulter cleared the bar with a 5.38 meter jump. Out-vaulting his competition by more than half of a meter, Weiler helped lift the men’s team to third place in the Heptagonal Championships.
Ben Glauser, Men’s Track and Field
The sophomore thrower brought in 16 points for the Crimson this weekend when he came in third in the shot put and first in the weight throw. In the weight throw, he surpassed his competition by nearly a full meter. Though short of the meet record, Glouser’s weight throw topped his 2011-2012 personal best by just under two full meters.
 
Victoria Lippert, Women’s Basketball
 
After scoring 24 points against Brown on Friday to help Harvard to a 77-71 win, the senior forward put up 19 points the following night against Yale. Lippert’s 24 Saturday points were just four points shy of her career-high that she set in her sophomore season against Colombia.
Christine Clark, Women’s Basketball
 
Clark achieved the first double-double of her career Saturday against Yale with 20 points and 13 rebounds. The Crimson defeated the Bulldogs, 69-66, in a sold-out showcase at Lavietes Pavilion. The night prior, the junior guard added 16 points against the Bears. Women’s basketball has won its last eight games played at home, four of which were Ivy League contests.

2012 was not an easy year for the Harvard baseball program.The team went just 12-30 during the regular season, finishing second-to-last in the Ivy League.On July 31, Joe Walsh, who had coached the Crimson for the previous 17 seasons, passed away from a heart attack in his New Hampshire home, leaving the community in mourning.And now, three of Harvard’s four top hitters from a year ago—junior shortstop Jake McGuiggan, senior second baseman Kyle Larrow, and junior outfielder Jack Colton—are no longer on this year’s roster. Their departure has cost the squad a pair of All-Ivy standouts in the former two players—who respectively hit a team-high .352 and .350 last season—while Colton was second on the team with 49 hits.The other of those top four hitters and the Crimson’s only first-team All-Ivy recipient, senior infielder Jeff Reynolds, graduated and was drafted into the New York Mets organization.  Also absent from this season’s squad is junior Steven Dill, who had the fourth-most at bats for Harvard last year.
On the pitching side, things are not much better. The team’s 2012 appearances leader, junior Zack Olson, is no longer on the roster, nor is classmate Joey Novak, who was second in innings pitched and games started a year ago. Senior starter Brent Suter graduated and was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers, while sophomore captain Andrew Ferreira left the squad after being selected by and signing with the Minnesota Twins.“It’s been a rough year for us,” senior Robert Wineski said. “[But] the team has really responded well. I think it really brought us closer together. It’s a very tight-knit group this year, more than any other team since I’ve been here. We’ve got [26] guys and we’re all pulling on the same rope.”Indeed, 2013 marks a fresh start for a squad whose makeup is very different than that of its predecessors.“The team is very excited,” junior infielder Carlton Bailey said. “We have a lot of new guys [and] talent, and with a new coaching staff, we’re really excited to see what we’re capable of.”The changes start at the top, where Bill Decker takes over the program following 22 seasons at the helm of Trinity.It will undoubtedly be a challenge for Decker to win in his first season at the Division I level, as his roster features just three seniors and 10 freshmen amongst its 26 players.But Bailey said that since taking over, the new manager—who won a Division III National Championship with the Bantams in 2008—has instilled a work ethic that the Crimson did not previously have.“We’re held accountable for what we do at a higher level,” Bailey said. “Coach Walsh was great. He was a great guy [and] all of us loved him, but Coach Decker reestablished a disciplinary code that all of us hold ourselves to.”That code will be tested by a daunting non-conference schedule that kicks off this weekend against Bucknell and No. 22 Virginia, the latter of which has started its season 7-0. The calendar also features non-conference games against Ohio State, No. 12 Rice, and Houston, among other opponents, before Harvard moves into league play.“All it does is help us, coming into Ivies, that we’ve seen top-caliber Division I teams,” Bailey said. “It really prepares us for [conference play].”

With blocking form submissions just around the corner, the next week will be a very stressful time for many freshmen. In order to try and help combat the unavoidable blocking anxiety, here are a few dos and don'ts that every freshman should follow.<!--more--> Do: Rank your potential blockmate on a numerical scale from one to ten. Make sure to take into account a variety of components that factor into their overall value as a person. Some factors to consider are their personality, their sleep schedule, their physical appearance, and whether or not blocking with them will increase your street cred. It is also advisable to post these rankings in a public place—such as your entryway's bulletin board or your Facebook status—just to ensure everyone is on the same page. Don't: Be accepting of your possible blockmates' weird living habits. These ""quirks"" such as skyping their dog and speaking to it in a Mickey Mouse voice or having a public appreciation for the band Nickelback may seem tolerable or even charming. But when the sounds of these pastimes transform into the haunting and torturous soundtrack that you fall asleep to at night, you will think differently.
Do: Present your possible blockmates with a series of tasks and critically assess their performance. Ask them to prepare you a meal, give you a back massage, or tell you a joke. Ask them what tricks they can do. The importance of knowing what each blockmate really brings to the table is paramount—you don't want to be surrounded by mediocre comics, subpar chefs, and people who can't properly execute a standard cartwheel for the next three years.Don't: Foster hope that people will change. This concept is a lie that has been told to freshmen for eons in order to pacify them into submission. The flawed creatures you see before you are as good as they will ever be. Lying to yourself will do you no favors and probably result in a slow and painful realization process in the (possibly very near) future.Do: Seriously consider floating. If it feels like your only hope, it probably is.

News about government policy is usually dominated by reports of debt crises, health care bills, or congressional gridlock. Every news story seems to foreshadow inevitable, lurking catastrophe, and every policy decision and government directive is undermined by negative connotations, debate, and future prospects. Government appears broken, dysfunctional, and without any long-term vision.But every now and then, we will hear about an initiative that should transcend petty political complaints and deep-seated differences. In his State of the Union Address on February 12, President Obama announced the <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/19/brain-map-president-obama-proposes-first-detailed-guide-of-human-brain-function/"">Brain Activity Map project, a proposed $3-billion research project to explore the workings of the human brain. Initiatives like BAM are emblematic of the kind of lasting legacies political leaders can leave, with intangible, yet powerful effects. BAM and other scientific endeavors should hold more authority as policy initiatives that could dramatically impact health, social, and political policies for decades to come.The Brain Activity Map is modeled off of the <a href=""http://www.genome.gov/12011238"">Human Genome Project, which <a href=""http://report.nih.gov/nihfactsheets/ViewFactSheet.aspx?csid=45"">revealed new insights into genetic code and yielded valuable research techniques and potentially landmark implications for the treatment of diseases. In a similar manner, BAM seeks to create the first comprehensive map of the human brain and the signals and neural networks that make it function. The project, if successful, would not only bring us closer to understanding some of the most enduring mysteries of human existence, but a brain map could also help us <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/02/three-awesome-tools-scientists-may-use-to-map-your-brain-in-the-future/"">develop new scientific fields like neural nanotechnology and help scientists better understand the circuitry of diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer’s, depression, and schizophrenia.Some remain skeptical that the initiative is a wise investment. The proposed budget is expected to <a href=""http://news.discovery.com/human/project-map-human-brain-130219.htm"">call for $3 billion to be spent over the course of a decade. Many <a href=""http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/02/why-some-scientists-arent-happy-about-obamas-3-billion-brain-research-plan/62258/"">question the economic wisdom of investing so many federal resources in one research project, and some scientists worry it will come at the expense of funding for other valuable scientific endeavors. The project’s goals, they argue, are too lofty, their focus too vague, and their potential yields uncertain.However, a centralized federal effort to understand the brain is the way to unite policy and science and promote human progress beyond the immediate and proximal concerns of most political debates. Beyond helping us satisfy our innate human desire to understand the nature of our thoughts and the secret, mysterious processes of our minds, this research could have <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/opinion/what-our-brains-can-teach-us.html?emc=eta1"">lasting impact on the lives of every citizen. We can develop better treatments and policy measures to help an aging population cope with dementia. We can devise new approaches to mental health care and to how we deal with mental illness. Some have even suggested that BAM could help us form more effective policies to win the war on drugs by exploring the brain of an addict. The possibilities and implications are vast.
Social policy isn’t the only policy realm that would be impacted by BAM. Like the Human Genome Project, BAM also serves as an economic stimulus. The Human Genome Project cost $3.8 billion over 13 years, but it more than compensated for the expense by <a href=""http://battelle.org/docs/default-document-library/economic_impact_of_the_human_genome_project.pdf"">generating $796 billion in returns and 310,000 jobs. Not all scientific studies enjoy the success and economic impact of HGP, but researchers working on BAM believe economic returns are likely, especially considering that research techniques <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-18/roche-alzheimer-s-push-may-gain-from-obama-brain-mapping-plan.html"">could lead to improvements of technology and potentially lower technological costs in the future. Harvard biologist George M. Church, who will be heading the BAM project, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/science/project-seeks-to-build-map-of-human-brain.html?_r=0"">expects the brain map to be as profitable as HGP, if not more so, and the research could jumpstart new, job-creating fields in science and technology.Intrinsically, humans are explorers. It is part of our nature to delve into the unknown, to search for answers and to reach for unseen heights. We should not forsake the future for the present. As President Obama <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50792324/#.USove2f0-ZE"">said in his State of the Union address, “Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.” The social and economic promises of a project like BAM are enormous, and they hold symbolic value, as well. We have cured diseases, traveled to the Moon, worked to unravel the very essence of our genetic makeup, sent a rover to Mars, and seen pictures of a planet surface 130 million miles away. The brain is the next, perhaps most important, frontier, and investment in exploration, scientific understanding, and progress is exactly the kind of legacy our government should seek to leave behind.Riley K. Carney ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, is a government concentrator in Eliot House.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.WHAT IT ISAccording to the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), Vassar College gives new meaning to the term ""liberal"" arts. The religious organization (frequently referred to as a <a href=""https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/legally-recognize-westboro-baptist-church-hate-group/DYf3pH2d"">hate group) has dubbed the private college in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. an ""Ivy League Whorehouse"" and is set to protest there tomorrow (February 28). An <a href=""http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20130210_Vassar-College-NY-Feb-28.pdf"">announcement on the WBC's website, tactfully entitled ""godhatesfags.com,"" proclaims that the group will protest the school for being ""champions of whoredom"" and having partaken in a ""fag agenda."" <!--more-->
WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTIONThe WBC may fight their battles with nasty name-calling and picket lines, but college students have one of the most impervious weapons known to the 21st century: social media. Current students, alumni, and LGBTQ allies worldwide have taken to the internet to defend the liberal arts ""whorehouse,"" referring to it as such themselves in an attempt to lighten the otherwise rather grim situation. Even though the protest isn't set to happen until Thursday, online media outlets took note of the commotion following its announcement earlier this month. <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/lindsey1z/22-reactions-to-westboro-baptist-churchs-plan-to-969f"">Buzzfeed published 22 of the best tweets and statuses made in response to the WBC's announcement. My personal favorite: ""Finally realizing that the Latin on my diploma reads 'Ivy League Whorehouse.'"" Enterprising Vassar alum Josh De Leeuw took the opportunity to <a href=""http://www.crowdrise.com/vcfeb28/fundraiser/joshdeleeuw"">solicit donations for The Trevor Project with a goal of $4,500—$100 for every minute the WBC plans to protest. At time of writing this article, the Crowdrise page had garnered more than $92,000. <a href=""http://www.thetrevorproject.org/"">The Trevor Project, which <a href=""http://www.thetrevorproject.org/HistoryOfTrevor"">draws its title from a 1998 short film, provides crisis intervention services for LGBTQ teens around the country.  Recent instances of intolerance at Vassar, a former women's college that is generally considered to be a very tolerant school, have inspired students to fight back against the WBC's intolerance with a vengeance. In December, incidents of <a href=""http://s149435.gridserver.com/2012/12/21/teach-in-confronts-deconstructs-semesters-bias-incidences/"">overt sexism and racist graffiti shook administrators and students alike, sparking ""Teach-Ins"" and committees to facilitate open conversations about the incidents.  ""Everyone is frankly very excited for this [WBC] event,"" said Vassar sophomore Claire Ashley. ""I actually found out about it as soon as Facebook started going crazy with the news that the WBC had added Vassar to their protest agenda, because a friend of mine busted into my room. In light of recent racist and sexist occurrences on campus, it seems like the Vassar community is especially anxious to unite against a hate group like the WBC."" The WBC also <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/11/29/westboro-church-baptist-harvard/"">protested Harvard Hillel in 2010, prompting a ""Surprise Absurdity Protest,"" a counter-protest in which students made ridiculous signs to signal that they found the WBC's message and actions to be irrelevant and pointless.

It is a modern American truism: College is too expensive. Four years of Harvard College tuition costs roughly <a href=""http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/financial_aid/cost.html"">triple the median American’s 2010 <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/11/news/economy/fed-family-net-worth/index.htm"">net worth. And yet, according to the federal government’s newly <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/remarks-president-state-union-address"">unveiled “College Scorecard,” a Harvard education is comfortably cheap. That conclusion stems from a net-cost analysis (tuition minus grants and scholarships) for students receiving financial aid: an average <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/higher-education/college-score-card"">tally of $18,277. Unfortunately, while that calculation anoints Harvard as the Ivy League’s cheapest school, this case proves one in which popular knowledge (that college is too expensive) outdoes the raw numbers’ suggestion. Harvard’s net cost is one bright but flickering spot, cast against a grimmer backdrop of painful college expenses, a challenge that the federal government should address.Before launching into that discussion, the accomplishment behind the $18,277 number deserves some plaudits. A genuine round of applause for a concerted effort by the College and alumni to make a Harvard education affordable and for a recent <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/harvard-tuition-lowest-league/"">trend of decline in average net price—15.5 percent over 2007-2009. A round of applause for keeping student debt at a minimum, $88.61 per month <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/harvard-tuition-lowest-league/"">versus other Ivy League figures all in the triple digits. And a round of applause for beating Yale.But bear in mind that those numbers miss the makeup of the Harvard student body, one of the nation’s richest. U.S. News <a href=""http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools"">places Harvard sixth among its Top 25 Universities in Pell Grant percentage, a useful proxy for economic diversity. Yet that ranking says little about a school in non-relative terms. Zooming in on Harvard, per the Admissions Office’s <a href=""http://www.fao.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k51861&amp;pageid=icb.page246751"">factsheet, 20 percent of students’ families have incomes below $65,000, an automatic trigger for full financial aid. That means incomes in Harvard’s bottom quintile span the United States’ bottom three (the third <a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=330"">tops out around $62,000), something less than a paragon of equity. Harvard’s Scorecard cost is as much a function of its students’ circumstances as it is of institutional efforts or innate munificence.Not every American college shares those circumstances. Instead, nationwide growth in college costs have consistently <a href=""http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/images/charts/Education/Education_inflation_chart.htm"">outpaced inflation. The typical American student graduates with nearly $27,000 in student loan debt; the typical Harvard aid package contains no loans, with grants in lieu of them. This is not to gush over Harvard’s progress—it is to show that, nationally, something needs to be done. In particular, the U.S. federal government should prioritize investment in education.In pared-down economic terms, that investment makes sense. <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w12984.pdf?new_window=1"">Research here at Harvard has found that in recent years, labor market demand for college graduates has outstripped supply. The historically <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w12984.pdf?new_window=1"">high college wage premium is a sure call for more graduates, which federal funding can engender. Education investment is a key element for long-term economic growth.
Beyond supply and demand curves, however, education funding can also address inequality and opportunity. Specifically, Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, authors of the study above, <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/education-and-technology-supply-demand-and-income-inequality"">attribute 60 percent of the growth in wage equality between 1973 and 2005 to increasing returns for education. Investment, of course, is needed long before college (rich-poor achievement <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/education/education-gap-grows-between-rich-and-poor-studies-show.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">gaps originate much earlier), but it should certainly persist throughout. And as an additional sign of potential, research <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Disadvantaged-Students-May/64895/"">suggests that college’s benefits are strongest for poorer students.Socioeconomic mobility has long stood as a storied American promise. Today, education, not merely legal protections, is the modern bulwark against ossification. Our government’s budget should better reflect that.

With only a few days left for Congress to avert sequestration, University President Drew G. Faust will travel to Capitol Hill this week to sound the alarm about across-the-board budget cuts that would likely <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/25/university-braces-spending-cuts/"">slash millions of dollars in funding for Harvard researchers.“What made the trip feasible and timely was the threat of sequester,” said Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president for public affairs and communications.Congress has until Friday to reach a deal to avoid sequestration, automatic cuts to the budgets of both defense and non-defense federal agencies. Without such a deal, Harvard’s researchers, who received a total of over $650 million in fiscal year 2012 from the federal government, will be forced to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/26/university-tackles-funding-cuts/"">find ways to offset the drastic cuts to their sponsored revenue.Starting on Wednesday morning, Faust will meet with Congressional leaders and freshman representatives from both parties. She will also lobby members of the Obama administration, including military officials.In these conversations, Faust will warn leaders of the harmful effects that she believes research funding cuts have on the nation’s intellectual and innovative vitality, which she has said in the past is closely linked with the health of the economy.
Sequestration threatens to trigger “a 10-year reset of American priorities,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications.Casey said that in addition to arguing against sequestration, Faust will push for a “growth agenda to help innovate our way out of the deficit.”“Research universities might be providing a resource that is part of the solution,” said Casey, who is Harvard’s chief lobbyist. “We like to be a resource to members across both sides of the aisle.”Faust’s research advocacy trip to the Capitol this week will be far from her first. In 2008, after five years of stagnant research funding from government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, Faust <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/11/faust-talks-to-us-senate-university/"">testified on the Senate floor against reduced federal funding for academic research.Faust’s previous visits to D.C. have also included conversations with business leaders and executives from other universities intended to “broaden our work in coalitions,” according to Casey.In addition to her talks with politicians this week, Faust will attend an event at the Library of Congress, an announcement of a Civil War project by the American Repertory Theater and the National Theatre, and a lecture and question-and-answer session at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nikitakansra@college.harvard.edu.

The Cambridge Police Department has released new details about a Saturday morning <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/23/mit-gunman-report-hoax/"">report of a gunman on MIT’s campus that authorities now believe was a hoax.In a Tuesday press release, CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello confirmed that the department received the false report via an internet relay, an instant messaging service usually utilized by people who are unable to communicate by regular telephone.Riviello added that CPD has since been in contact with Sprint, the service provider of the internet relay, which helped CPD to identify a preliminary suspect. According to Riviello, that initial suspect has been cleared of suspicion.CPD is continuing to investigate the origin of the suspected hoax, and is prepared to press charges against the originator of the false report if that person is found, Riviello wrote.Riviello also wrote that CPD has been in communication with the MIT Police Department, the FBI, the United States Secret Service, and the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office as it proceeds with its investigation.
On Saturday, the report of a man with a “long rifle and body armour,” as described in an MIT emergency alert, prompted a campus-wide lockdown. After receiving the report at  7:28 a.m., CPD responded by scouring the building in the Main Group complex on MIT’s campus where the gunman had reportedly been spotted. But after the room-by-room search yielded neither a gun nor a gunman, CPD called off its hunt, and the campus lockdown was lifted at 10:45 a.m.—Staff writer Matthew Q.

As the sun set on Tuesday evening over Soldiers Field Stadium, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team gained an early lead and held on tight, defeating Holy Cross, 16-12, for its first win of the season.Offense won the day for the Crimson (1-1) as it made its biggest mark in the first quarter, with goals scored by senior midfielder Alex White, junior attackman Peter Shwartz, freshmen attackmen Devin Dwyer and Sean McDonagh, and midfielder Brendan Newman, all of which went unanswered until the last minute of the quarter. With 34 seconds left in the frame, Crusaders sophomore attackman Clay Haarmann scored his first of seven goals (1-2), just four fewer than his total goal count last season.Shwartz collected two assists and four goals in the game for Harvard, leading his team in scoring en route to his first collegiate hat trick.White, who had a hat trick against UMass on Saturday, repeated the feat on Tuesday with three goals and two assists.“Offensively, we were spot-on in terms of shooting,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “We rode very hard. We won face-offs, played hard all over, and buried our shots.”
But things didn’t stay positive for Harvard in the second frame. The team’s 10 shots on goal in the first half fell to seven in the second, while Holy Cross jumped from two in the first to 17 in the second. The Crusaders outshot the Crimson for the rest of the game, finishing with 39 shots on goal to Harvard’s 32.“We had trouble defensively slowing them down,” Wojcik said.“We were erratic in our clearing game,” he added, noting the Crimson’s 11 successful clears in 17 attempts.Harvard’s defense also struggled to keep Holy Cross out of the box, as Haarmann, sophomore midfielder Terry McKenna, and senior midfielder Myles Gillespie combined for six goals in the second quarter alone.Haarman totalled three unanswered goals at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second, putting the score at 6-3 with 13 minutes left in the half.While it had fewer turnovers than Holy Cross in the first quarter, Harvard more than doubled the Crusaders in turnovers in the second, finishing the game with 24.“It was definitely a pretty sloppy game,” captain Jason Gonos said. “Offensively, we put goals up, [but] defensively, we didn’t do a good enough job of stopping them.”Gonos added a tally himself at 12:49 in the second quarter when he grabbed a loose ball from the midline and drove up, uncontested, for an unassisted goal, the first of his career.“I just kind of shot and it luckily went in,” Gonos said.Shwartz added an unassisted goal for the Crimson, which was quickly answered by a score from Gillespie with the assist coming from Haarmann, who then went on to score twice more in a four-second span. McKenna finished off the Holy Cross run with an unassisted goal at 0:29 in the half, making the score 9-7.

The No. 7 Harvard women’s ice hockey team closed out its regular season with a fifth straight win over Yale, 3-1, to clinch a share of the Ivy League title on Tuesday night at Bright Hockey Center.The Crimson (21-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC), which last won an Ancient Eight championship in 2009, will split the conference title with Cornell.“You have opportunities to win things throughout the year,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It doesn’t just happen through February—it happens in every game you play. We put ourselves in a position to win an Ivy title and share it with Cornell. That’s a great thing for us. It’s nice to have that for our seniors and everyone else in the program.”The Bulldogs (5-21-4, 4-15-3 ECAC) were held to just 12 shots on goal, the same number that they registered when they hosted the Crimson in a 4-0 Harvard shutout on Nov. 3.Knotted at 1-1 after the first two stanzas, Stone’s team knew the third period would be crucial in determining if it would finish the season on a positive note.
“Everyone was pumped in the locker room going into the third [period],” freshman forward Mary Parker said. “We knew we were tied and it was a big moment. We had 20 minutes left to make a statement and roll into Dartmouth this weekend. We were all excited and wanted to work hard and do our best.”Four and a half minutes into the closing frame, sophomore defenseman Michelle Picard found senior forward Kaitlin Spurling on the left side of Yale’s attack zone. Spurling drilled the puck, off Picard’s assist, past Yale goaltender Jaimie Leonoff for a one-point advantage.Leonoff made 35 saves through a contest during which she found herself under a constant stream of shots from Crimson skaters.“Their goaltender played really well for them, hat's off to her.” Stone said. “We had a lot of pressure and a lot of good looks at the net. There were scrambles in front, so she did a really nice job managing her area.”Nearly 14 minutes later, in front of an empty goal, Parker slapped a fast shot from the neutral zone and found the back of the net to put Harvard up, 3-1, with just 92 seconds left in the contest.“[Parker is] playing hard and she’s earning everything she’s getting and that’s great,” Stone said. “Sometimes you get those empty netters, but for sure she earned her empty netter tonight because she played with a lot of grit. She killed a lot of penalties and she played great d-zone.”The goal was Parker’s second of the night and fifth this month. Almost six minutes into the first period, the rookie sent an unassisted puck flying into the goal past Leonoff from the top of the right circle.“[Before] the first goal, I was coming off the bench,” Parker said. “[Junior] Lyndsey [Fry] and [co-captain] Jillian [Dempsey] were working really hard in the corner and the puck popped out. I just went in and tried to get towards the middle and take a shot. I was pretty lucky there.”The Bulldogs responded about six minutes later with a goal of their own. Senior forward Natalie Wedell tried to slip the puck in past the Crimson’s senior goaltender Laura Bellamy. Bellamy rebuffed her attempt but was unsuccessful at stopping Bulldog forward Patricia McGauley, who was assisted by Wedell and sophomore defenseman Madi Murray.The puck stopped there for Yale, which went scoreless for the rest of the contest. The rest of the team’s play was dominated by an inability to penetrate Harvard’s offensive zone and a rash of penalties.The Bulldogs picked up four penalties, while the Crimson notched five infractions. Neither team was able to convert on its power play opportunities.“It was a hard fought game today,” Stone said. “We had to really dig in at the end and find a way to win. Certainly we’re psyched. Our kids have been earning this all season so it’s nice.”—Staff writer Cordelia F. Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter @CrimsonCordelia.

Last month, a bipartisan group of four senators introduced a bill that, if passed, could impact the lives of many in the Harvard College community.The <a href=""http://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d63fb0be-253c-494f-bc5b-35c2c3694c49/Summary%20of%20the%20Immigration%20Innovation%20Act%20of%202013.pdf"">Immigration Innovation Act of 2013, unveiled on the same day that President Obama proposed a framework for comprehensive immigration reform, aims to increase the number of work visas given to foreign nationals with advanced degrees from 65,000 to 115,000. It also exempts holders of advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from the annual cap on green cards.To start, the bill is plain good economics for the country. It is an indisputable fact that technology and human capital drive long-term economic growth. However, despite the United States’ dominance in high tech industries, the country’s education system <a href=""http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=6aaa7e1f-9586-47be-82e7-326f47658320"">falls behind other nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in STEM graduates. This gap between the supply and demand of highly skilled workers is filled by foreign workers, two-thirds of whom are <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2012/07/18-h1b-visas-labor-immigration"">STEM graduates. Before the education system can satisfy the labor market’s demand, the bill will, as the senators put it in a <a href=""http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=5ce8642d-517a-4637-a39f-2f52c063056c"">press release, “[ensure] the United States can maintain its competitiveness in the global economy” by keeping foreign talent in competitive fields.The bill would also have tremendous effects on the personal lives of international students at Harvard. Under the current immigration laws, international students make large sacrifices in their careers. Since work visas typically <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/i-129instr.pdf"">cost employers more than $5,000 and have a high rate of rejection, only the largest and most resourceful corporations can afford to hire international students. As a result, international students with technical skills that are valuable to the economy often resort to taking offers in finance and consulting rather than with the engineering start-ups that their skills are more suited for. Some advanced degree holders are effectively enslaved by their employers, as their legal residence in the U.S. depends on their employment. Giving foreign advanced degree holders more flexibility in options will free them from this unbalanced employment relation and allow them to fully use their scarce and desired skills in the economy.Despite the great benefits of increasing visas and lifting the green card cap for advanced degree holders, Senate Democrats rejected a bill with <a href=""http://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issues_STEM%20Jobs%20Act.html"">similar intent after it passed the House vote. The disagreement was over another part of the bill that aimed to eliminate a lottery visa program, which randomly selects the same number of visa applicants from countries with low immigration rates to ensure a diversity of new Americans. The bill also drew <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saphr6429r_20121128.pdf"">official opposition from the White House for not meeting the objectives of President Obama’s comprehensive immigration reform plan. Even though there was no opposition from either party to keeping more foreign advanced degree holders in the country, this sensible bill fell apart in the midst of partisan bickering.
The failure of the previous bill showed a lack of commitment to this issue by both parties. This is perhaps because foreign students, with no votes or resources for lobbying, hold no power in national politics. The most vocal champions of immigration reform for skilled workers have been <a href=""http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2012/09/27/strengthening-american-competitiveness-and-creating-opportunity-for-the-next-generation.aspx"">technology companies in dire need of employees. The list of beneficiaries, however, would extend far beyond the giants of Silicon Valley. Harvard is home to no fewer than 4,400 <a href=""http://www.hio.harvard.edu/abouthio/statistics/pdf/MainStudentFileFY13NEW.pdf"">international students, who make up 20 percent of the student population. For many international students, staying in the U.S. after graduation is a viable and often desired choice. However, under current immigration laws, international students will be <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=e34c83453d4a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=e34c83453d4a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD"">denied entry if they declare an interest in staying in the country after graduation. Such schizophrenic bureaucracy can potentially turn away many capable students, who would make Harvard a more diverse place, both academically and culturally. These international students, who leave familiar environments to seek academic opportunities, already possess the intelligence and courage that characterize successful entrepreneurs. If these students stay in the country more often, they will surely contribute to the reputation and success of the University in the long term.The Harvard community has been an advocate of social progress for the least emancipated members of society. It is time that Harvard takes an active stance on immigration policy to ensure a more stable future for its students who do not (yet) have the right to vote. With the support of Harvard and other educational institutions, politicians will hopefully take these issues more seriously. With friendlier policies in Washington and a public reputation as a place that cares for its international students, Harvard could be an even more attractive place for the world’s brightest.Jonathan Z.

Matt Birk ’98 faced long odds to achieve NFL stardom and reach the top of the football world. Harvard had produced just 15 NFL players since 1935, and even after the Minnesota Vikings selected him with the 173rd pick of the 1998 NFL Draft, he faced an uphill road to success in a league nicknamed “Not For Long.”Fifteen years later, Birk beat the odds and went out on top, announcing his retirement on Feb. 22 after making more Pro Bowls—six—than all but four players drafted in 1998 and winning Super Bowl XLVII on Feb. 3 as the starting center for the Baltimore Ravens.The two-time All-Pro is arguably the most successful NFL player to play for the Crimson and is just the second Harvard player to win a Super Bowl.Crimson coach Tim Murphy, who coached Birk during his time at Harvard, saw his success coming.“I’m not surprised at all that Matt made it in the NFL,” Murphy remarked. “What is truly amazing, though, is that he has become one of the best players at his position on the planet.”
JOE MAKES HIM PROHailing from St. Paul, Minn., Birk arrived in Cambridge to a team that had gone 3-7 the previous season. Murphy came to campus the same fall and the pair helped engineer a turnaround that culminated in a 9-1 record and Ivy League title in Birk’s senior season in 1997.“Matt probably improved more as a player and an athlete in his four years than any other kid I’ve ever been around,” Murphy said. “He basically willed himself to become an NFL-caliber player.”The center took his game to the next level entering his senior year, and he credits much of his improvement to a new offensive line coach, Joe Philbin, who is now coach of the Miami Dolphins.“Going into my senior season, I thought it would be the last time I’d ever play football,” Birk said. “So I really rededicated myself that off-season, but the biggest key was that they hired Joe Philbin as the offensive line coach. I learned so much from him.”Birk progressed so far that he began to catch scouts’ eyes.“One day, I asked a scout, ‘Do you really think I have a shot at this?’” Birk recounted. “He said, ‘Yes, you do.’ So that’s when I really decided to go for it and went full speed ahead.”At the season’s end, Birk earned All-Ivy League and All-ECAC first team honors and became the first Crimson offensive lineman to be drafted since Roger Caron ’85 in 1985.HOMETOWN HEROAfter his hometown Vikings selected him, the sixth-round draft pick spent his first two seasons as a backup on the squad’s offensive line, where he learned from the team’s stars.

As extreme weather dominates the headlines, a recent report co-authored by environmental science professor Michael B. McElroy suggests that climate change is a threat to national security.The report, co-authored by McElroy and D. James Baker, a former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, examines the short-term implications of climate change on the existing infrastructure and the impact of a polarized political dialogue on national security overall.“If the richest country in the world regards the climate issue as the matter of a vote, a left-wing or right-wing vote, and is not prepared to talk about the facts, then we are not prepared to provide the leadership this world deserves,” McElroy said about environmental policy disagreements among lawmakers.The other issue highlighted in the report is the government’s lack of preparedness for severe weather conditions.In the report, New York governor Andrew Cuomo emphasized the importance of having reliable infrastructure when Hurricane Sandy left significant damage to the Eastern seaboard last October.
“We have a new reality when it comes to these weather patterns,” Cuomo said in the report. “We have an old infrastructure and we have old systems, and that is not a good combination.”The publication also described the increase in high-impact weather conditions and unusual climate phenomena, saying “their extent is worldwide, affecting people where they live, where they draw upon fresh water resources, and where they grow food.”“In the case of New York City, did anyone really predict that a storm surge of more than 20 feet could envelop lower Manhattan?” McElroy said.Part of the report focuses on the Hadley Circulation, a weather system in which air travels north after losing much of its moisture to precipitation in tropical areas.“What seems to be happening in recent years is that the input of new energy to the climate system due to what we are doing by burning fossil fuels, in particular, is energizing the system,” McElroy said. “It is more energetic than the tropics, so it is going higher and further north than it normally does.”The result of this new energy input is an extension of the desert environment, which could potentially envelop Spain, Italy, Greece, Israel, and the Mid-Western United States.“I’m hoping that by what I do at Harvard—talking about this issue with undergraduates who are going to be policy leaders—we can make a difference,” McElroy said. “Scientific literacy is important for people who are going to be Economics, English, or whatever concentrators. We all need to have an understanding of the world, where it came from, and where we are going.”—Staff writer Indrani G. Das can be reached at idas@college.harvard.edu.

Besides their ages, Philip Roth and Pope Benedict XVI would appear to have little in common. The mischievous, secular, and oft-profane Jewish-American literary provocateur and the sophisticated theologian, the staunchly traditional Bishop of Rome, seem cut from entirely different cloth. But each of these men recently made rather surprising announcements that were remarkably similar: They were retiring, stepping down and away from occupations that have historically been considered lifetime positions. In so doing, they have forced us to reconsider basic assumptions about vocation, career, and the management of a life.Sometime in the late summer or early fall of this year, Philip Roth detached a Sticky Note from its fellows, scrawled a note to himself, and stuck it on his computer. For those responsible enough to utilize such mnemonically responsible props, they can help remind us to send e-mail, or meet a friend for coffee, or start thinking of the first chapter of our thesis. For Roth, it was a different kind of reminder, not to do something, but to stop doing what he had been doing for nearly half a century, nearly better than anyone else: writing fiction. In an <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/books/struggle-over-philip-roth-reflects-on-putting-down-his-pen.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">interview with Charles McGrath of the New York Times, Roth read the note out loud to an America whose fictional sense of itself he helped fashion. It read like this: “The struggle with writing is over.”  Such renunciations of literary activity are more common than they might appear to be. Shakespeare famously retired back to Stratford-upon-Avon after writing “The Tempest” in 1610-11, and Harper Lee has not written a book since “To Kill a Mockingbird” in 1960.  The Pope’s play is a little more unusual, not having happened in 600 years or so.Of course, Roth, like Shakespeare and unlike Lee, was no one-hit wonder. From “Goodbye, Columbus” to the epochal “Portnoy’s Complaint” and through the Zuckerman trilogy and such late masterpieces as “Sabbath’s Theater” and “American Pastoral,” Roth has had an illustrious career. But what interests me is this notion of a “career,” and more specifically what our writers, celebrities, and spiritual leaders owe us.  Most recently and infamously, the NFL quarterback Brett Favre was widely denounced for continuing to play past his prime, for mistiming his exit cue and imposing his eroding skills on a public weary of his waffling career plans. Michael Jordan somehow managed to retire both too early and too late, leaving to play baseball at the peak of his NBA career and then returning to play basketball when he was no longer the same player. Perhaps we react so strongly to these decisions because they are tied to the body’s capacities and failings. We understand that to succeed as a professional athlete requires a breathtaking measure of grace, coordination, and strength, gifts vouchsafed to the young. The decline in those metrics that comes with age can be unseemly and can seem terrifyingly tangent to our own fears of hurried mortality.In some ways, Roth’s decision to “hang up” his computer or Benedict his staff is analogous to the proverbial spikes. Just as much as shooting a basket or throwing a pass, the qualities of inspiration and composition and spiritual fervor tend to favor the youthful. The glories of both Wordsworth and Whitman date to an initial effervescence of creative force. Keats was dead at 25, and John Kennedy Toole wrote “A Confederacy of Dunces” before his 30th birthday. William Butler Yeats and Wallace Stevens both produced substantial poetry late in life, but they are the exceptions that prove the rule. We expect writers to write continually. They owe us their insights and their books at regular intervals, to read and write papers about or maybe just place on our bookshelves.Benedict and Roth thought differently, however, realizing that the profession of immortal truths is contingent on the possession of bodily strength, a perishable commodity. At moments when purpose and ability converge, the world feels commensurate to our aims, and its scale is congruent with our own. Both Roth and Benedict began to feel the balance tipping in the other direction, and the receding overlap between who they were and what they hoped to accomplish. It is fortunate that both of them thrived in fields that were always somewhat adjacent to inactivity; the still of prayer and the solitary isolation of the consumed reader always undergirded their more public iterations. Both faith and art are things you do alone and hope others can share. Finally, they both ask of us a final measure of devotion that is also a valediction.
I vividly remember a visit by the Nobel Prize-winning author V.S. Naipaul to campus last year. Naipaul’s “A House for Mr. Biswas” is among my favorite novels. I asked the 80-year-old writer a question about the experience of writing the book. He refused to answer, a decision I only later understood. For me, the book was powerfully and emphatically in my present, reaching and teaching me with a powerful immediacy. For Naipaul, the book was an artifact 50 years old, a lifetime ago. Great works of art or the spirit can partake in a perpetual contemporaneity. Unfortunately, the men and women who make them adhere to a less leisurely chronology. Sometimes, one, or two, of them might want to step away from it all, leaving us a little in the lurch, but also a little in awe.Ari R.

Panelists Sean Penn, former Haitian Prime Minister Michèle D. Pierre-Louis, and General P. K. Keen headed a discussion Tuesday night about post-earthquake recovery in Haiti at the Harvard Kennedy School JFK Forum. The panelists, moderated by Public Policy Professor Mary Jo Bane, agreed that although Haiti has made much progress in the three years following the disaster, it still needs more time to reach and surpass its former level of economic development.Pierre-Louis started the discussion by remembering Haiti before the earthquake. “If you look at the figures, Haiti was climbing gradually,” she said.Still, all three panelists expressed optimism about the nation moving forward.“The difference between the Haiti I landed in and the Haiti today is extraordinary,” Penn said. “More miraculous is the fortitude of the Haitian people.” J/P Haitian Relief Organization, the non-profit  organization for which Penn serves as CEO, employs over 300 Haitians, runs one of the largest camps for displaced civilians, and works to remove rubble from destroyed areas.“There is not a begging culture—the main thing they’re gonna ask you for is a job,” Penn said, adding that the little money most families spend generally goes toward schooling their children. Monetary investment in education would have the largest impact on economic growth and recovery, Penn said.
Keen commented on the need for the United Nations to establish a national police force that Haitians would respect as a symbol of authority. That said, he and the other panelists admired the recent peaceful transfer of power—something that happened for the first time in Haiti in 1996—even in the midst of such a devastating event.Pierre-Louis also raised the issue of college-educated Haitian citizens leaving the country upon graduation. She insisted that there was social mobility in the country and encouraged expatriates to return to and improve their country.Penn responded to questions that implied his organization is interfering too much with rebuilding affected areas, and that J/P HRO should leave tasks such as the rebuilding of the National Palace to the Haitian people. Several times throughout the discussion, he stressed that the image the media painted of J/P HRO’s work and the lack of progress of the country as a whole was incorrect. The organization’s work, Penn said, is aimed at “sustainable change” to mobilize Haitians to improve their cities, and that first-hand accounts like his own are “the only unequivocal evidence.”Penn closed by saying that three years is still too soon to properly gauge the recovery.“The realist will look at the next 15 years,” he said.

Kicking off its non-conference season at the Florida Atlantic Classic this weekend, the Harvard softball team has big shoes to fill.The reigning back-to-back Ivy League champion made its mark at the end of last season, when it became the first team from the conference to win a game in the NCAA tournament since 2005.But when the Crimson takes the field in Boca Raton on Friday, it will be with a decidedly different—and younger—starting lineup.After graduating pitcher Rachel Brown—who led the Ancient Eight in strikeouts—and infielder Jane Alexander—who started all 50 games and closed out the season with a team-high .381 batting average—Harvard will look to its 13 freshmen and sophomores to fill the void.“That was a really strong senior class,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “There was strong leadership and they had just grown so much. This team is an underclass-heavy team…but probably one of the hardest working and fighting teams I’ve ever had.”
Of the six teams participating in the Classic this weekend, Harvard is the only one that has not yet begun its season. Florida Atlantic University (5-9) has participated in three tournaments since the beginning of February and this will be the third consecutive competition it hosts.Taking the field on Friday morning, the Crimson faces Jacksonville (10-4) and Ball State (6-3) in back-to-back games. The Dolphins jumped out to a strong start at the Panhandle Invitational and have suffered their only losses at the hands of nationally ranked opponents. The Cardinals have participated in two tournaments and hold a winning record, relying on a strong offense that has outscored its opponents, 77-31.“We kind of have an idea of a couple of lineups that we’re going to want to look at this weekend,” Allard said. “We hope to give everyone some experience playing. I think the goal in the first weekend is to get out there and compete and see what we still need to work on.”On Saturday, Harvard will have a more balanced schedule, playing Eastern Michigan (2-3) in the morning and host Florida Atlantic University in the evening. The Crimson’s match-up against the Eagles will be only the second in program history, with the first coming in a 5-1 loss in 2009. Eastern Michigan has looked to seniors Katy Blaharski and Courtney Nicholson—each batting .429—for a majority of its offensive output thus far this season.Despite their losing record, the Owls have been in a number of close games and, along with Michigan State, have the most on-field experience since opening their season in early February. Sophomore pitcher Samantha Messer—fresh off a two-hit complete game last week—leads a strong Florida Atlantic pitching staff that has held its opponents to a .259 batting average.In its first tournament of the year, Harvard will look to explore its pitching options. Coming in without an established rotation, the Crimson has a number of options to replace Brown, including returning sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz, freshmen Morgan Groom and Jamie Halula, as well as senior Jess Ferri—a utility player who pitched as a freshman.“[Ferri has] made some really good adjustments this year,” Allard said. “We’re hoping to get some work out of her. We don’t necessarily have a starting rotation, but we have four pitchers ready to go who can help the team.”Before returning to Cambridge on Sunday, Harvard will face Michigan State (8-6) in the final game of the weekend. The Spartans have come away with winning records in their last two tournaments behind starting pitcher Kelley Smith, who leads the team with a 2.20 ERA.The five-game tournament will be an opportunity for the Crimson’s six freshmen to play at the collegiate level for the first time. In addition to the two pitchers, the class includes catcher Rachel Halperin, outfielder Zoe Galindo, and infielder/outfielders Haley Davis and Alyssa Siegman.“They’re a competitive class,” Allard said. “They came in a little unassuming, but when they were bought into our off-season training program and our conditioning and our lifting program, they had so much improvement and growth.”Traveling south to warmer weather, Harvard will be able to play outside for the first time this season.“I think we want to just work well together as a team and just feel what it feels like to play a game again,” said junior co-captain and outfielder Shelbi Olson. “We’re mostly just excited to get on a real field and play on the dirt and the grass, in the sun.”—Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu.

Students gathered for Harvard Speaks’s first event of the semester on Tuesday night, where undergraduates delivered presentations on topics ranging from disaster in Madagascar to a time management iPhone app. Harvard Speaks—a speaker series that hosts undergraduate students to speak to each other about their passions—was founded last semester.“Every student here is so incredible with a wonderful story to tell,” co-founder Eliza L. Malkin ’13 said. “This is a chance for Harvard students to get an opportunity to be heard, to grow as a community, and get a sense of their fellow students’ passions.”In addition to giving students a platform to speak about issues, Harvard Speaks was also created to spread awareness of charity organizations. Every student speaker chooses a charity to support, and ties their speech into the charity’s mission. The group hopes to have an event each month this semester.Danamona H. Andrianarimanana ’13, the first speaker, talked about her home country of Madagascar. After recent political strife left the formerly flourishing nation in crisis, Andrianarimanana got involved with organizations to help rebuild and rejuvenate her home country.“It is easy to destroy. Rebuilding is harder, whether you’re rebuilding a project, a dream, or a country,” Andrianarimanana said. “No matter what happens, I will never stop trying,” she added.
After Andrianarimanana, speaker Jalem D. Towler ’15 addressed the issue of self-love in a spoken word performance.“We’re all struggling with something. A lot of that for me was love,” Towler said. “Love lifted me, and it can lift everyone else in this room.”Another speaker, Peter G. Machtiger ’14, gave a presentation on Team Rubicon—a veteran service organization that uses disaster response to help reintegrate veterans into society. According to Machtiger, inadequate disaster response and inadequate veteran reintegration are two problems that can solve each other.Former speaker and event attendee Kristina Saffran ’14 said Harvard Speaks brings valuable perspective to participants.“It’s a really great way of getting to know your fellow students and being reminded of how impressive your peers are,” Saffran said.The event ended with group leaders thanking all attendees and encouraging people to apply to be speakers.Every speech that is given is videotaped and uploaded to the Harvard Speaks YouTube channel for others to enjoy. Students can apply to speak themselves or fill out an application for a fellow student they would like to hear speak.

Students can now download an unofficial version of their academic transcript to send to summer internship or graduate school programs.Each student can now access their unofficial transcript under the Campus Resources tab on the my.harvard website, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke. The document, which can be downloaded as a PDF file, looks just like a student’s official transcript, but does not have Burke’s signature. Unlike the online student record that is also available under the Campus Resources tab, the new unofficial transcripts will list full course titles instead of abbreviations.Udai Bothra ’16 said that having access to transcripts online would save students time when going through application processes, especially since most students request one by the end of their sophomore year.“It’s a good idea,” Bothra said. “It will just be a lot more convenient.”Before this change, students seeking transcripts had to order an official copy from the FAS Registrar. The Office of Career Services said that students often resorted to using the online student record file when applying to summer internship or fellowship programs.
“The issue is that [this student record] is not really designed for the outside world,” Burke said. “People wouldn’t see the course titles, and they saw all this code about whether you’re meeting your requirements.”While the online student record contains symbols unrecognizable to individuals outside the University, the unofficial transcript clearly indicates how many courses have been passed.The move to make unofficial transcripts available online was prompted by students from the Undergraduate Council and Graduate Student Council, who suggested the idea to Burke when he was first <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/12/8/burke-registrar-school-kennedy"">appointed as FAS Registrar in Jan. 2011. Since his appointment, Burke has said that improving online services would be a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/6/online-students-burke-registration/?print=1"">priority.“This is a great example of collaboration between the administration and student advocates,” said UC Education Committee Chair Darragh Nolan ’15.Though the new feature was officially released early this month, Burke said that the Registrar did not immediately announce the news to the student body so that they could first ensure its functionality.Though no formal announcement has been made, Burke said 652 students have already accessed their online unofficial transcript since it was launched.—Staff writer Madeline R.

As Congressional lawmakers attempt to hammer out a compromise on federal spending before automatic budget cuts kick in on Friday, Harvard Kennedy School professor Joseph E. Aldy is proposing his own way of reducing the federal budget deficit—eliminating subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.In a research paper published this month, Aldy suggests that abolishing 12 tax provisions subsidizing fossil fuel production could reduce the federal deficit by as much as $41 billion over the next 10 years.According to Aldy, a professor of public policy, over $4 billion of tax expenditures are transferred from taxpayers to fossil fuel producers every year.Aldy’s proposal is one of many papers submitted by experts from the public and private sectors as part of an initiative by the Hamilton Project, a think tank in Washington D.C.Aldy and others were asked to “provide innovative, pragmatic proposals for lowering the deficit by reducing expenditures of raising revenues,” according to the institution’s website.
In addition to reducing the federal budget deficit, Aldy argues in his paper that the absence of subsidies will reduce fossil fuel producers’ relative business advantage and potentially lower global fuel prices.“Implementing this proposal will contribute to a leveling of the playing field among oil and gas companies...and will promote the efficiency in allocating capital across the U.S. economy,” wrote Aldy in his paper.“Removal [of the subsidies] will not materially increase retail fuel prices, reduce employment, or weaken U.S. energy security,” he added.According to Kennedy School professor and environmental economist Robert N. Stavins, interest groups such as owners of coal and natural gas companies have upheld the subsidies, despite their widely known distortionary effects.“Subsidies in general are a problem,” Stavins said.In addition to increasing economic efficiency in the U.S., Aldy said he believes the policy can encourage other countries to phase out their own fossil fuel consumption subsidies—a move that would in turn lower U.S. oil prices.Stavins affirmed the policy’s global relevance, saying that the largest subsidies are in the world’s large, developing countries such as China and India.“Developing countries want to keep fuels at low price for the population and direct transfers to low-income people,” Stavins said. “They want to spread the use of energy in the economy.”—Staff writer Michelle S.

Ivy League basketball will get some decent exposure this weekend, with two games set to air on national television. The players will receive the vast majority of the attention, and rightly so, but I’d like to take a moment to give it up for those other Ivy students ready for their moment in the spotlight: the fans.It’s one of the things that makes college basketball different from the pro game—a condensed atmosphere filled with (sometimes) well-lubricated college students looking to burn off a little stress. Our own columnist, Catherine E. Coppinger, captured “the racket” that was the decidedly unfriendly atmosphere at Payne Whitney Gymnasium on Saturday, complete with angry bros and naughty chants. Princeton and Penn, the traditional powers of the conference, can always be counted on to create raucous home atmospheres, and Harvard is starting to approach their level. Take a gander at a few “I Believe” YouTube videos from Lavietes Pavilion if you’re not convinced.Even lowly Brown, sitting at sixth place in the Ivy standings, can get rowdy on occasion. The Bears lost to Harvard on Friday despite the best efforts of their rabid student section, which I had the privilege of witnessing in person. Though held silent for much of the first 30 minutes by the miserable product on display—going 1-for-14 from three with 19 turnovers can do that to a crowd—the Brown faithful was quickly whipped into a frenzy by an on-court t-shirt giveaway. A mini-hoop dunk contest featuring three local eight-year-olds further emboldened the Bear Den, until its members felt confident enough to lob a series of taunts at a follically challenged member of Harvard’s squad: “RO-GAINE, RO-GAINE,” and “A-A-R-P!” among them. Inspiring stuff.Oh, the wonderful freedom granted by diffusion of responsibility, allowing us to feel morally indifferent to loudly and rudely criticizing the manner in which someone pursues his or her passion. Would I ever belt out a “You’re terrible!” during a chemist’s struggles with a stubborn strand of messenger RNA? If I was in the midst of a crowd of other screaming apes, I just might.YALE at COLUMBIA
You’ve got to give Yale forward Brandon Sherrod a lot of credit for not quitting the game of basketball after Harvard sophomore Wesley Saunders’ posterizing thunder dunk nearly killed him. It takes quite a bit of strength to internalize and come to grips with that sequence of events: “I was a victim of the most mortifying play my sport has to offer in front of friends and family at the hands of my archrival. It was then viewed across the country on an immensely popular television program. And I’m okay with that.” Sherrod’s mental resilience was further on display later in the game when he picked up a technical foul for clapping in the face of Crimson point guard Siyani Chambers after blocking his shot.Pick: YaleBROWN at CORNELLIt’s a two-game road trip for the Bears, which generally portends two disastrous losses. Brown is 3-10 on the road this year, as compared to a surprisingly decent 7-4 home record. Perhaps the Bears owe their relative success at the Pizzitola Sports Center to those aforementioned students. Unfortunately, no self-respecting human would dare venture too deep into Ithaca without a compelling reason, and spectating at an insignificant basketball game just fails to qualify.Pick: CornellDARTMOUTH at PENNThe Palestra has hosted prouder matchups than this one. Show some respect, Dartmouth. At least take your boots off before you come on the floor.Pick: PennHARVARD at PRINCETONI don’t think I’ll get much resistance when I say this is the most important game of the Ivy season. The game will be televised on ESPNU, which is a bad omen, if you’re into that sort of thing. Harvard has yet to break the “Curse of ESPN,” losing every game it has ever played on the Worldwide Leader’s family of television networks. Maybe that’s because ESPN will only air Ivy games it knows will be extremely competitive. Or maybe it’s witchcraft.

My political background seems pretty typical of a Harvard student. I grew up in a household full of liberals. In high school, I joined the Young Democrats club and volunteered for the campaigns of several local Democratic politicians. And when it came time for me to vote this past year, I proudly cast my ballot for President Obama. I have always considered myself a Democrat, and a liberal one at that. That is, until I got to Harvard. Here, I have somehow been made to feel like a conservative.It is not something that happened right away. I stepped onto campus in the fall excited to get involved in what I expected would be a vibrant liberal political environment. I attended a few meetings of the Harvard College Democrats and often engaged in political discussions with my peers in informal settings. When a friend chided me for being unaware of the concept of <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/5/preferred-gender-pronouns/"">Preferred Gender Pronouns, however, I began to realize that the liberals of Harvard were much further to the left than I had ever imagined.  Now more than a semester into my time here, it seems clear to me that the political left at Harvard operates almost exclusively on the fringes of liberalism.Rather than focusing on the ongoing budget negations and the economic health of our nation, the liberals of Harvard spend their political capital vilifying oil companies through the divestment movement and obsessing over political correctness. With much of the Harvard community, let alone the general population, still unaware of the existence of PGPs, liberal student groups here are pushing for their institutionalization. The focus on these far-left issues has left me, and other mainstream Democrats, feeling disillusioned about the state of Democratic politics at Harvard.Furthermore, this radical approach is damaging to the very causes these students are trying to promote. Fixating on PGPs, for example, detracts from the broader push for transgender acceptance and equality. It trivializes the important issues at stake. We should work towards making substantive gains in areas such as marriage equality and combatting discrimination before focusing on issues of semantics. To say we need a shift in focus is not to belittle the ideas behind the concept of PGPs; it is only to suggest that taking such radical stances on these issues is not a winning strategy.Besides losing the support and participation of moderates, the ruling liberals of this campus are missing an opportunity by moving so far to the left. At a time when the Republican Party has moved so far to the right that some pundits, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/opinion/sunday/dowd-a-lost-civilization.html?_r=0"">such as the New York Times’ Maureen Dowd, believe it is on the verge of extinction, we have the chance to show the rationality of Democratic politics. We need to buck the “idealistic liberal” stereotype and bring common sense to the political arena by presenting reasonable solutions to the core economic and social problems of the average American. In this way, we can keep the far right from even coming close to implementing its reckless economic policies and intolerant social agenda.
While college is undoubtedly the time to push the boundaries of our political ideologies, the expressions of radical leftism on this campus hinder the achievement of the mainstream democratic agenda.  If we continue to move further and further left, we bring the radical right back into play. So long as we are as far to the left as they are to the right, the American people, who are <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/152021/conservatives-remain-largest-ideological-group.aspx"">on average moderately conservative, are left with no clear choice.And while Harvard students obviously do not dictate the current platform of the Democratic Party or even the platform of the national liberal movement, we will assuredly play a role in forming such platforms in the future. Outside observers rightfully regard Harvard as a bastion of liberalism, and the behavior of our students gets more than its fair share of media attention. We cannot dismiss the fact that the focus and tone of our discourse matter.Harvard students have long been known for their liberalism—and perhaps I should have been less surprised than I was by the extremity of it—but that does not mean we cannot also be known for our pragmatism. There is nothing wrong with having lofty progressive goals and passion about social justice, but it is important to understand the current political atmosphere. As liberals, we need to return our focus to the issues that people outside the walls of Harvard care about—the issues we can push while the Republican Party remains weak. We need to leave the radicalism to the right and work to win on the mainstream issues before we contemplate the frontiers of liberalism.Carson J. Scott ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Grays Hall.

The signs started appearing in 2009, at the height of the recession: Bright blue letters on yellow corrugated plastic, nearly indistinguishable from the thousands of others offering liquidity solutions to the desperate. They were stapled to telephone poles and planted upright in lawns. But these signs weren’t soliciting the sale of junk cars or forclosed homes. Instead, they offered “CA$H for your WARHOL.”At first, the 617 phone number listed as a “24-hr message service” was just a cell phone number belonging to Geoff L. Hargadon ’76. When calls started pouring in, however, Hargadon began using a Google Voice account to record the messages.Responses ranged from the apparently sincere (“I don’t have a Warhol, but I have…a [Alexander] Calder and a Peter Alexander I want to get rid of”) to the outraged (“You’re vandalizing the Back Bay…. You don’t really want my Warhols! Do you really want my Warhols?”). One caller even dubbed Hargadon’s work “The best propaganda I’ve seen in years.” Another left a message describing the three “beautiful” warthogs he had for sale, including one with an eye problem. The Philadelphia Police called to complain about the placement of a sign. Some of the calls even came from art galleries and “people who should know better,” in Hargadon’s words.The posters, however, were intended as a joke. “I thought it would be a good send up to the one percent. At that point in the financial crisis, everybody was in it, and even people who had Warhols were looking for bailout money,” says Hargadon.Hargadon was surprised, however, by the immediate and overwhelming reactions to his signs. “I thought it would be sort of an obvious prank,” he says. “But it was amazing how many people would call me offering Warhols.” Some people even sent in photographs, using an online form on the project’s website, of Warhols of varying quality and authenticity: cheap posters, unsigned multiples, and even a painting that Hargadon estimates to be worth $500,000.
Today, Hargadon has compiled over 2,000 phone responses to his signs into a digital archive. He plays them from a widescreen iMac in the lofted studio space he calls “the laboratory” on the top floor of his Somerville home. Hargadon, who works in wealth management, calls art his “jeans-and-sneakers avocation.” When he shows me around his studio, however, he is wearing an immaculate button-up shirt, slacks, and shiny leather Oxfords.Hargadon is tall and thin, with neatly cropped grey hair and blue eyes. At Harvard, he was an economics concentrator and lived in Kirkland House. Art “wasn’t even on the radar screen” for him in college, he says. Around 20 years ago, though, he had a “eureka moment” at an exhibition of work by Minimalist master Sol LeWitt. Hargadon subsequently fell in love with street art, and began collecting work by artists like PIXNIT, Swoon, Bäst, and the Brooklyn-based duo FAILE.In 2005, Hargadon caught the attention of the art world with a parody of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s “The Gates,” a temporary installation of bright orange nylon arches that lined the pathways of New York’s Central Park in winter 2005. Hargadon’s “The Somerville Gates” was a miniaturized version that snaked through the doorways of his home and past his cat, Edie. “The Somerville Gates,” which was originally promoted solely via email to 30 friends, went viral and wound up three days later on the front page of The New York Times Arts Section.Hargadon’s work, from doll-sized gates to Warholian sale signs, always picks fun at the overlap of art and commerce. The “Ca$h For Your Warhol” signs themselves, most of which are manufactured by Bandit Signs in Oklahoma, now sell for up to nearly $1,000. “I’m not really a skilled artist,” Hargadon readily admits. “I’m more of a conceptual artist—which sounds really pretentious, but I mean it literally: I’m dealing with concepts.” He continues, “I’m kind of relying on the skills of other people, but that’s okay because everyone’s doing that these days.”Hargadon’s project caught the attention of other artists, like Jenny Holzer, whose conceptual work also deals heavily with text, and Shepard Fairey, best known for his iconic tri-tone Obama poster, whom Hargadon considers a friend. The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, an organization that promotes the arts in accordance with Warhol’s will, even commissioned a set of signs for its board members—photographer Cindy Sherman was among them.But Hargadon pays close attention not only to his admirers but also to his critics. One street artist, Hargadon remembers, called him a “yuppie rich boy douchebag.” Hargadon’s response? “I may be a yuppie, and I may be a douchebag, but I’m definitely not rich,” he says, laughing.In general, though, Hargadon says he gets along with street artists, despite differences in artistic project and public persona. “I visit with them, and I have good friendships with a lot of them and I think there’s mutual respect,” Hargadon explains.Hargadon’s art is about provocation, not gratification. “I think art that tries to please all people ends up failing,” he says. “Some of them probably think it’s ridiculous, what I do, and that’s okay.”

“I made a promise that when I hit college, I wasn’t going to worry about labels and what other people thought. The beginning of senior year was when I began identifying as transgender,” says John, a student at the college who has been granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want his gender identity known to his family, which still considers him female. “Junior year was when I really started thinking about it.”Charlie, another transgender student who has been granted anonymity by The Crimson because he wanted his gender identity to stay private, relates a similar experience. “I knew that I was a gay man at a pretty young age, and was feeling like I was an impostor,” he says. Yet having been born biologically female in rural Virginia, there were no places where Charlie felt comfortable discussing both his sexuality and gender identity, neither of which matched what was expected of him. “I had no access to resources and didn’t know anyone who was trans.”He continues, “I felt like I would be alone for the rest of my life.”Misunderstood identitiesAs perhaps the least-recognized group in the BGLTQ acronym, Ariel C. Churchill ’15 explains, there exist a lot of misconceptions about trans individuals—people whose gender identities don’t align with the gender assigned to them at birth. These identities may fall within or outside of the male/female binary, or may include aspects of both male and female.
Churchill, who does not identify as trans, is cochair of the Trans Task Force, a student group promoting awareness of trans issues and advocacy on campus. She says that the concept can be a difficult one for people to understand.“There’s a lot of weight to the idea of being trans. It implies a lot of historical oppression,” Churchill says. First, says Churchill, is “the idea that someone who is transgender is a man trapped in a woman’s body, or vice versa.” In fact, says Churchill, many trans-identified people don’t feel that way.Another misconception is that all trans people seek to alter their bodies. “For some people, there is a level of body dysphoria,” or intense bodily discomfort, she says. While some who feel that way do seek surgery, continues Churchill, this doesn’t account for all people who identify as trans. “For many people, they are perfectly happy with their bodies, and to them, transgender means a different kind of gender expression.”“When you meet a new person, the first thing that you will code into your mind is gender. Before race, before whether they are good looking or not, you will decide whether that person is male or female,” says Churchill. She adds that this can make it difficult for some people to accept a more nuanced view of gender. “If you tell people that there is more than male or female, they will disagree, because then they have no security in what they think.”Finding a CommunityJohn says that he first came out to members of the Harvard community during Visitas. After the experience, John says, he realized that he wasn’t ready to come out to others.“When I got here, there was the LGBTQ meet and greet, and I didn’t really know anyone in the room,” he says. “That’s when I fully said my gender identity out loud in front of basically strangers.” Though he was excited in the moment, John says, “Afterwards, I felt I wasn’t actually ready to come out.”For Charlie, Harvard was immediately more comfortable than the community in which he had grown up. “I found that there were resources if I looked hard enough,” Charlie says.This sense of personal comfort was a stark difference from the sense of danger he had faced elsewhere. “I was in a lot of danger at home. Physical danger when people began to notice that I was queer,” Charlie says. Yet life at Harvard was different. “When I came here, I didn’t feel unsafe,” he continues. “I wasn’t worried about sleeping at night.”John and Charlie, who are both members of the Trans Task Force, allude to the organization as a safe space among people who understand their concerns.John emphasizes the benefit of being in a community where he doesn’t have to constantly educate others about his identity. “It’s nice having a space where you don’t have to preface everything with an explanation,” John says.

With messages written in bold characters on their arms and faces and a host of diverse stories to recount, students and faculty members gathered at Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday to partake in the photographic project “Dear World” of artist Robert X. Fogarty.Throughout the day, Fogarty took photographs of dozens of Harvard community members, which he then showcased in the evening in a keynote address and slideshow at the John F. Kennedy Forum.“I take people’s portraits, but they are not just any portraits,” said Fogarty, whose art consists of photographic snapshots of subjects with messages written on their skin.“I ask people to share one message about someone or something that matters to them,” he said.Fogarty’s project began in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as “Dear New Orleans.” In Louisiana, Fogarty took portraits of hurricane victims, firefighters, and volunteers. The project eventually expanded to become “Dear World.”
Scott J. Yim ’13, whose message read “You can’t always tell,” explained how people sometimes go through difficulties that are not immediately noticeable by others.Yim recounted his experience coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community at the end of his sophomore year.“It was quite a struggle, but I was fortunate enough to find amazing teammates, roommates, and friends,” said Yim, who has since spearheaded the production and distribution of “It Gets Better,” a video meant to provide encouragement to those who may be undergoing similar difficulties.Kennedy School students Federico E. Cuadra Del Carmen and Pinar A. De Neve came to the forum in the afternoon to have the message “Help us, help others” photographed. The phrase is the motto of a global health non-governmental organization that both students work for.“Our organization started off by fundraising for other NGOs—hence the motto,” De Neve said.Harvard Divinity School student Jane L. Wolfe, who is 47 years old, teared up as she narrated the story behind her message, “GED to Harvard: Here I am. Yes you can.”“I waited 32 years to get an education,” said Wolfe, who is the mother of two children and survived Hurricane Katrina. “The way you are going to make an impact is to go out in the world, and serve, and share your education with others. You can wait 32 years and still make an impact.”Kennedy School student Jenny L. Mallamo said that she was happy to hear of her classmates’ stories “through a few simple words about where they want to go, what they have done, or what they do right now.”“You, the people I photograph, have the ability to inspire and to lead us,” Fogarty said in conclusion to his address. “I hope we recognize that we all have voices and stories to tell.”—Staff writer Antonio Coppola can be reached at acoppola@college.harvard.edu.

If you think Harvard is a <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/02/ted-cruz-sees-red-not-crimson-at-harvard.html"">revolutionary communist <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/02/ted-cruz-responds-harvard-law-was-full-of-communists.html"">hotbed, don’t apply. If you think Harvard is full of “<a href=""http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=3274"">pinheaded” professors, don’t enroll. And if you think Harvard <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election-2012/harvard-educated-mitt-romney-rips-president-obama-spending-time-harvard-article-1.1057223?localLinksEnabled=false"">pollutes the minds of its students, don’t walk out of here with a degree—and certainly don’t get two.You see, lately, there seems to be a pernicious trend of public figures—especially those on the right—falling in love with Harvard just long enough to benefit from its educational resources and, yes, its social prestige, before turning against our school. Just recently, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas affirmed his belief that Harvard Law School was, during his years as a student there, home to a cohort of “Marxists who believed in…overthrowing the United States government.” In November, Fox News pundit and Harvard Kennedy School graduate Bill O’Reilly glibly referred to Harvard professors as “pinheaded” while implying that the Harvard community is morally suspect for its <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/29/bdsm-new-club-approved/"">acceptance of Harvard College Munch, a group for students who share an interest in kinky sex. And last April, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who holds a J.D. and MBA from our fine institution, lambasted President Obama for having spent “too much time at Harvard.”Such episodes of treachery are apparently attempts to curry favor with the more anti-intellectual members of our body politic. Yet it is finally time that we say enough is enough. We at The Crimson urge anyone who plans on one day scoring political points by maligning Harvard to neither apply, enroll, nor graduate from this fine institution.If only we could have spoken to a young, wide-eyed Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, or Bill O’Reilly. We would have assured them that it was okay to be anti-intellectual, and that millions of people around the world do it every day. Although we didn’t share their dread of academia, we would have tried to make them feel comfortable with the lifestyle they were preparing to lead. We would have attempted either to disabuse them of whatever cognitively dissonant impulses gave them the urge to attend Harvard or, at the very least, try to prepare them for the potentially scary environment that awaited them. For one, we would warn them that Harvard has a few liberals. While they may seem strange and foreign to a young conservative, they are almost certainly not secret communists and probably actually less of a threat to the integrity of the United States government than some people back <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/us/politics/texas-secession-movement-unbowed-by-white-house-rejection.html?_r=0"">home. Second, we would warn them that education gives people new ideas that they might not have otherwise had. This may make them seem “pinheaded,” or it may even change them a bit, as Mr. Romney suggested about President Obama. But it probably doesn’t make them stupid.If we could have spoken to these three young men, we could have spared them from the fear and anguish that must come part-and-parcel with seeing oneself as instructed by insurrectionists or buffoons. If we could have spoken to these three men, we would have told them never to come to Cambridge.

On February 20. British comedian and self identified executive transvestite Eddie Izzard spoke at Harvard’s Memorial Church to accept the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism presented by The HSS Cultural Humanism committee at Harvard. Dressed in his signature drag as he sits with me after the event, Izzard sips a glass of wine and cracks open pistachios with long fingernails painted a bright shade of red. A couple of designs on his nails stand out.1. Fifteen Minutes: I see that two of your nails aren’t red. What’s the story behind those?  Eddie Izzard: That’s the British flag, and that’s the European flag. So I’m a British-European transvestite. 2. FM: That’s a lot of European pride.
EI: Yeah. That’s a political statement. It displays my sexuality and political alignment, and I like it because it’s girly, but it’s also political. So it’s tough-edged, girly, and very shiny and sparkly.3. FM: Do you have any big future plans? I hear the papacy is vacant.EI: I’m running for mayor of London, so that’s a big enough plan.4. FM: What made you decide to run?EI: I felt like I could be political, and if I wasn’t doing entertainment, I would do politics. Which is slightly bonkers, since I like the entertainment industry and politics looks tougher. But, I thought because the Nazis and fascists keep coming back and keep bringing racism and xenophobia and putting that forward, I felt I should go in. I have a certain amount of energy and new ideas, and I think I should put that into the mix. I should do at least one election and see what happens to see what I can do. Sometimes you have to stand up and be counted.5. FM: Do you think being a comedian prepared you in any way for politics? EI:  Politics can be very dry, so if you could make a serious speech and make it a little lighthearted, I’m sure people will be thankful for that. And it gives you a certain confidence when talking to people. Just like Al Franken’s gone in, I’m going in. I think Al’s one of the first comedians in the world to go in like this. But I planned it for some time, and I realized Al was doing it. Hopefully I will get to a place where Al is.6. FM: George Carlin once said that the role of the comedian is to find where the line is drawn and then cross it. In your mind, what is the role?EI: I think that’s fine for George—I can totally understand what George is saying. I think it’s to entertain in the most beautiful way you know how—to juxtapose ideas in a new way. If you can inform at the same time, then it’s a bonus, but it’s just entertainment. Find the line, and then crossing it that’s interesting. I don’t see that as my main thing. I’m not necessarily trying to cross lines—I do, but it’s not my main drive.  If I can point out something without crossing a line, like: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” I was reading about that and saw it was the Golden Rule, and it’s in Christianity, and it’s in Judaism, and it’s in Islam, and it’s in Hindu faith. It’s in all of them, fucking hell. That’s not crossing the line, that’s just saying treat other people as you’d like to be treated yourself. I think that’s the only thing in religion you need. You don’t need the prayers, the fig, the body of Christ, the thing with the hammer—any of that shit, forget it all. Just treat people as you’d like to be treated. Now that gets rid of a whole load of religious paraphernalia, but I think it’s true. That’s all you bloody need.7. FM: I’m also aware that you were in some hot water a few years ago for recycling jokes. Do you think there’s an unfair expectation of comedians to come up with new material?

UPDATED: April 23, 2013, at 7:54 p.m.On a Thursday night in the spring of 2012, students huddled in study groups in Lamont Café, racing against the clock to finish an assignment due the next day. Notes and textbooks were shared, suggestions passed back and forth. There were dozens of students there, or at least enough that voices echoed to amplify the buzz of discussion.The task’s guidelines for completion were hazy, and the fact that the course had many section leaders with varying expectations heightened the confusion. It was easy for members in the crowd to help each other out. For those who didn’t understand, didn’t have time, or just didn’t care, group work turned into copying.That summer, after Lamont had emptied out for the semester, the accusations came. The cheating was “unprecedented in anyone's living memory,” according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.But the students who had collaborated in Lamont that spring evening faced no accusations. They had not been enrolled in Government 1310.
***The students in Lamont, who were described by a fellow classmate, had been working on a problem set for Economics 10. It was Government 1310, though, that received national attention after Harris announced in August that the Administrative Board was investigating approximately 125 students for inappropriate collaboration on a take-home final in a spring course.The scandal was followed by months of discussion and closed-door deliberations, ending this February 1 with an announcement from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith that left the results hushed and inconclusive. Over half of the students were forced to withdraw; about half of the remaining cases resulted in disciplinary probation.Government 1310 has been treated by some administrators as the unfortunate exception, an isolated incident whose case has now been closed. But as academic integrity dances uncertainly through a campus whose gates and walls are engraved with a motto of truth, Veritas is at stake.The scandal speaks to a more systemic problem with the value Harvard places on its undergraduate education. The institution and the community condones, if not promotes, academic dishonesty, emphasizing prestige over intellectual growth. Academics are no longer the priority of the students or teachers at Harvard College. No SurprisesDays before the August announcement of the Government 1310 investigations, Brett Flehinger filled a newly created position, associate secretary of the Administrative Board, aimed at promoting awareness of policies surrounding the issue of academic integrity.His appointment seemed to signal an acknowledgement from the University that academic dishonesty is a widespread issue in need of address, and yet a reluctance to acknowledge a culture of cheating beyond Government 1310 persists.“I think to say that there is a particular culture here that causes [academic dishonesty]—I don’t even know how we would measure that culture in the first place, but even if we could—I don’t think that would be accurate,” Flehinger says, when asked whether there are underlying factors that promote academic dishonesty at the College.Flehinger’s statement casts Government 1310 as an example of the extreme: 125 students taking advantage of one class’s unclear collaboration policy.

Kholoud Al-Faqih, the first female judge in a Palestinian Shari’a court, spoke of struggle and success as a part of the Harvard Divinity School’s “Women’s Rights in a Man’s World” panel on Wednesday.The panelists—including Al-Faqih, her translator, and fellow female leaders and Divinity School affiliates Nidal Al-Azraq, Hauwa Ibrahim, Leila Ahmed, and moderator Gloria White-Hammond—discussed barriers for opportunities for women hoping to work within Shari’a law courts.Al-Faqih was ranked the world’s tenth most powerful Arab woman by Arab Business in 2012 and was named one of the world’s most influential Muslims in 2012.Al-Faqih told the room that in Palestine, “one of the hardest obstacles that we faced was the society. The society did not accept us because the society believed the idea that this position was only for religious males.”Ibrahim, a Nigerian defense attorney and visiting professor at the Divinity School, said that “where one sex dominates—in this case maybe the male sex in Shari'a courts—progress, freedom, peace and sustainable development will be slowed.”
Though the process may be difficult, Al-Faquih said that women have the capability to create change and must change their perspective on themselves in order to succeed.“As women, we have to look at ourselves from all directions, from all mirrors, not from a broken mirror,” Al-Faqih said. “If we look at ourselves, as women, through a broken mirror, we will see ourselves as parts, broken parts, and parts doesn’t mean anything. If we look at ourselves, as women, from a complete mirror, we will see a complete human being with full rights.”Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton said that this “inaugural conversation” was the first of many talks about the boundaries and divisions of religion and social justice, funded by the recent Susan Shallcross Swartz Endowment for Christian Studies.Social and environmental activist Susan Shallcross Swartz, who attended the panel, said the talk fulfilled her hopes for the endowment.“Our hope and vision is that these conversations will invigorate our understanding of Christian studies by exploring ethics and cross-cultural understanding,” Swartz said.—Staff writer Zohra H.

UPDATED: February 28, 2013, at 4:23 a.m.Fung Wah, the low-budget Chinatown bus service, has been ordered by federal and state officials to suspend service indefinitely following reports that the company’s fleet posed serious safety risk.The Boston-based bus company, which offered services on the half-hour between South Station and Manhattan, voluntarily complied with the order Saturday evening, taking almost the entirety of its fleet off the road.The effect the suspension will have on Harvard students remains unclear.“I’m rattled,” said Matthew W. G. Walker ’16, who said he loved the bus. “I’d pay $15 for the cultural experience alone—last time I rode there were two elderly ladies sitting across the aisle who were performing some sort of ritualistic chant for all four hours of the overnight trip to New York. It was thrilling.”
“But actually, I dabbled with Greyhound, Bolt Bus, and Peter Pan, but found Fung Wah the most reliable,” Walker added.This suspension is not the first time the bus service has attracted negative attention. In August 2005, a bus caught fire on Interstate 91. In September 2006, a bus rolled over, causing minor injury to 34 passengers. Recently, one of its fleet hit two pedestrians in Manhattan. Fung Wah’s drivers have also been found to be in the bottom three percent amongst their peers nationwide based on qualification, and the company has been cited for 159 maintenance violations since 2011.Some students said they have always opted for other bus lines.“I would never take Fung Wah, said Lexis B. Ross ’13. “I take Megabus.”Other students, however, said they were disappointed that Fung Wah would cease operations indefinitely.“It was nice to know that it was an option,” said Reshma A. Lutfeali ’13, who is an inactive Crimson news editor. “It’s also kind of sad that this institution of college life is being shut down.”—Staff writer Yen H.

At Harvard, it can be difficult to tell history from myth. Archives, legends, and centuries-old student organizations all do their part in keeping both truth and stories alive. Harvard’s chairs sit at the heart of this process. The grand oak thrones that populate the sanctums, houses, and castles in Cambridge are all bulky reminders of the weight of the past on Harvard’s present.Not much is known of these relics. Harvard’s grand chairs have historically been located on Mount Auburn Street, which once spilled over with the fine luxury clubs and private dorms that earned it the title of Harvard’s ""Gold Coast."" In the murky early years of the 20th century, the student organizations near Mount Auburn—the Crimson, the Lampoon, and the Advocate—began to commission their own seats of scrolling arms and heavy feet.The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, had one such grand seat reserved for its president in its early years. But the original dark and stately chair went missing, as objects of status are wont to do, and was never recovered. In 1967, alumni donors gifted an unknown amount of money for the construction of a new chair made of Honduran mahogany.The Lampoon has a strict no-picture policy inside the castle. Lampoon President Eric R. Brewster ’14 and and his roommate Tyler M. Richard ’14, a member of the Lampoon’s business board, both report that the chair was constructed on-site since it was too big to fit through the tiny blue-and-yellow door of the organization. The farcical size serves a practical function as well—it is insurance against theft. If the Lampoon Chair ever vanishes in the middle of an event, it will have left the building in pieces.The Advocate’s humble, human-sized throne, which easily fits out the door, fell victim to real theft in 1995. Harvard Police suspected a harmless student prank and investigated no further. While the oldest publications on campus often make these chairs the subject of light-hearted pranking, it is easy to forget that these artifacts hold real historical and monetary value.  A Harvard parent happened to salvage the throne only a year later at an antiques fair in Malden, MA—but how it got there remains a mystery.
The solid and humble arts-and-crafts style chair now rests in its rightful home on the second-floor sanctum of the Advocate building at 21 South Street. The chair dates back to 1919, when the Advocate ordered a stately chair built for their house, then sandwiched between the Crimson and the Lampoon at 53 Mount Auburn Street. When the Advocate moved locations in 1957, the chair was paraded through the streets of Cambridge behind a white horse with white cardboard wings, a representation of the Pegasus, an Advocate motif.Unlike other chairs, the Harvard University Band’s ""Throne"" has clear provenance—and has never been stolen. The Throne stems from the flourishing tradition of grand chairs created nearly 40 years ago by student publications, but was loaned to the Band by the University. In 1953, the Band received a notice, according to a letter that hangs on a wall next to the Band Manager’s office, that the Dean’s Office would like ""to loan a chair to the Band on a permanent basis if it would be acceptable"" to be used as the Manager’s chair. The Band’s Throne is nearly eight feet tall, edged with molding in the egg-and-dart style, and is topped with a brass plate inscribed with the Band’s motto, Illegitimum non Carborundum, which is bad Latin loosely translated as ""don’t let the bastards grind you down."" The chair is in terrible condition, its dark wood scratched and discolored.The equally tall, blonde-colored Crimson chair sits chained in the center of The Crimson’s second-floor sanctum on Plympton Street. It has been stolen many times throughout its history, and the chains and locks securing the chair to the warped wooden floor have grown thick and tangled. On the front of the chair is the organization’s name couched in simple carved scrollwork. On the back are plaques engraved with the names of Crimson presidents since 1903 (as well as Franklin D. Roosevelt ’04, retroactively added). Some of the brass plaques have fallen off in repeated pranks by the Lampoon. In 2011, the chair was flown across the country and made a surprise appearance on the Jimmy Fallon show. Later that year, it was stolen during a Lampoon parade honoring the Boston Bruins as ""The Best Sports Team Ever.""Despite Lampoon-sponsored jaunts across the country, The Crimson’s chair has changed very little over the years. More names of Crimson presidents, engraved on plaques, have been added, but a picture of the chair in 1910 could have been taken yesterday.Today, Richard, the Advocate’s current President, does not worry about his throne being pranked—even after being legitimately stolen, the throne is neither chained nor locked in the smoky sanctum at 21 South Street. Rather, Richard worries more about how little institutional memory exists at the Advocate.And indeed, in all Harvard’s student organizations, members file in and out within the space of four years, leaving little documentation of their time or impact. In some ways, then, the marks or memories they leave on these chairs reify them as relics. The chairs become more real than the fleeting presence of the organizations they represent.Richard recognizes this in his inability to pin down much of the history surrounding its artifacts. He finds the disconnect ""very problematic and a little unsettling."" For Richard, the chairs play some part in rectifying this disconnect. As he says, ""These chairs function as a totem through time.""

One culinary question you'll never hear debated is where in the United States to go for a bagel. The supremacy of the New York bagel is a closed case—an accepted tenet of foodie-ism that is about as up for discussion as Avogadro's number.After I decided to come to Harvard, my mom bought me an enormous winter coat. But I was less concerned about Cambridge winters than I was about the prospect of being out of reach of a decent bagel. I went my entire first semester at college without attempting to fill the void. But positive experiences with Cambridge sushi and Cambridge pizza gave me a ray of hope. This week, Connie and I attempted to do the impossible: find a bagel worth eating within walking distance of Harvard Yard.<!--more-->JP Licks:   Let's get one thing straight—thank God JP Licks makes ice cream. After the first bite of our cinnamon raisin bagel, it was all we could do not to demand we be given back each of our 109 cents. Why? A near twin to the stiff, rounded bread they're serving up is available for free at Annenberg. Actually, it is an insult to d-hall bagels to claim that this attempt was d-hall quality. It wasn't. Sinking our teeth into the dryness of the bagel was an experience so devoid of poetry it doesn't deserve a simile. Happily, our suffering was short-lived: we shuffled out the door, careful to avoid making eye contact with the cashier who had eyed us suspiciously as we made faces at our food.VERDICT: It goes without saying, we crowned no bagel baron at this establishment.Gato Rojo:  We asked the barista where they got their bagels (Danish Pastry Company). Maybe we should have asked where they bought their toaster. The plain bagel we were served was a little on the dry side, and very thin by bagel standards, but oh my, what a toast! For a moment we were almost fooled into believing we had uncovered a superior product.
VERDICT: Maybe one's best option is horizontal integration: buy your bagel at a worthier venue (to be revealed); migrate to Gato for the toast. Otherwise, save your dollar—or invest in a pot of Gato tea!Annenberg:  Early Wednesday morning, we went back to our roots and sampled an Annenberg bagel. We like to call it a stomach filler: the breakfast equivalent of the plain pasta that has taken up permanent residence on the ""Love Your Heart"" menu. And unlike at Gato Rojo, there is no magical toaster to redeem the sub-par product. But hey, if you jockey for a slot in the Annenberg toaster, you can at least say you had a hot breakfast. Not to mention a free one.VERDICT: Just ok.Panera/ABP:   We took a stab at the age-old question: what actually differentiates Panera from ABP? Well, we're stumped. Other than the fact that one plays elevator music at a significantly louder volume (Panera, this is not a club, turn it down), the chain cafés appear to be one and the same, particularly when it comes to bagels.VERDICT: That's right. The bagels we sampled at both establishments tasted exactly the same. The asiago cheese bagel we picked up at Panera ($2.25 with cream cheese) was just more expensive than the $1.27 investment we made in the ABP jalapeno and cheese bagel.Crema Café:   Crema Café, an eatery better known for its pastries, took the proverbial cake. At $2.80 a pop (cream cheese included), this is the priciest option.  However, for those stricken with a case of the bagel blues, it is a worthy investment. This bagel is as close an approximation of the classic New York bagel you're going to get on this side of the Hudson. It boasts a fluffy texture, and just the right level of chewiness. The morning we stopped by, the bagel-of-the-day was of the ""everything"" persuasion. (You might say it meant ""everything"" to us). Fair play, maybe not, but the oniony accouterments lent this particular contender an aroma and an added flavor which ensured that, when we returned the remnants to our brown bagel bag, it was the most decrepit among the survivors.VERDICT: The best in the Square.

Last year, more than <a href=""http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/lung-cancer/resources/facts-figures/lung-cancer-fact-sheet.html"">160,000 Americans died from lung cancer. It was the leading cause of cancerous deaths, and is expected to only increase in both prevalence and incidence over the coming years. Yet ask the average American what he thinks the most common type of cancer is, and lung cancer does not immediately cross his mind. Especially in recent years, propaganda surrounding lung cancer awareness has been stingy; I only learned that November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month—or that lung cancer even had an awareness month—this past year, after a friend’s recommendation to read a New York Times <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/when-treating-cancer-is-not-an-option/"">blog on the subject. What’s most ironic is that when lung cancer began to exceed breast cancer as the leading cancerous killer amongst women, awareness of the disease started to steadily decrease.Why do we forget such a dangerously persistent killer? Or perhaps a better question would be, is our ignorance by choice? These questions are difficult to answer because they force us to question our moral standing. There’s no denying that given its startling <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/"">statistics, lung cancer should be recognized first and foremost as an extremely deadly medical disease. But instead of objectively seeing lung cancer for what it is, we form prejudices against the patients of lung cancer and blame them for their circumstances. Thus, we do not sympathize with them as much as we do with victims of the more “attractive” cancers. This in turn affects how much we are willing to help raise awareness to find a cure.A few decades back, smoking (and thus lung cancer) used to be on everyone’s minds. The 1970s <a href=""http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/1/4.full"">coalitions against cigarette smoking helped increase lung cancer awareness. But since then, the flame has burned out—almost leaving the impression that lung cancer was conquered, and it was time to tackle the next leading cancerous killer. The stigma associated with lung cancer, perhaps generated from media depictions of it as an unattractive disease, could account for why people prefer not to talk about it. Breast cancer, which has the highest <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-funding"">funding amongst cancers, generates an image of solidarity and a “<a href=""http://breastcancersisterhood.com/"">sisterhood” amongst survivors—a stark contrast from the imagery associated with lung cancer. Asking for donations for lung cancer research is much more difficult when lung cancer is considered an “ugly” disease.These donations play on a person’s ethics: How likely is someone to donate to a cause that helps treat people who might be responsible for their own predicament? Inheritance accounts for only <a href=""http://lungcancer.about.com/od/causesoflungcance1/a/famhxlungca.htm"">1.7 percent of lung cancers; the rest of the diagnoses result from smoking (which alone accounts for a staggering <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/"">80 percent of lung cancer deaths), second-hand smoke, or work conditions. Even government spending on lung cancer is <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/cancer-funding-does-it-add-up/"">conservative—in 2008, the National Cancer Institute granted almost $13.5 thousand per breast cancer death and only $1.5 thousand per death for lung cancer.There are other issues working against coalitions to save lung cancer patients besides this subtle “holier than thou” perspective. One such issue is how hopelessly deadly the disease is. While more “popular” cancers like breast cancer can rely on survivors to inspire hope, lung cancer is so deadly that survival is scarce. It has a 16 percent five-year survival rate as opposed to breast cancer’s 90 <a href=""http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/lung-cancer/resources/facts-figures/lung-cancer-fact-sheet.html#Survival_Rates"">percent. Trying to find a sustainable cure for such a lethal disease seems futile. Why not donate to causes that might actually make a difference, the reasoning goes. This attitude solidifies the pessimistic image surrounding lung cancer, which in turn affects how media chooses to depict lung cancer and prolongs the never-ending cycle of continuous ignorance against the disease.
Focusing on why people are diagnosed with lung cancer deters people from realizing the sheer severity of this disease. Instead, we need to focus our attention on the facts: Lung cancer is the leading cancerous death in America, its prevalence has steadily <a href=""http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/lung-cancer/resources/facts-figures/lung-cancer-fact-sheet.html#Survival_Rates"">increased and is estimated to increase even more in the coming years, and it receives much less government funding than would be expected for such a dangerous disease. After absorbing these facts, we need to take action. More money needs to go into researching early detection strategies, <a href=""http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-02-screening-avert-lung-cancer-deaths.html"">many of which have already proven to be very promising.Considering how far science has come in understanding cancer and potentially finding a cure, one would hope our attitudes towards lung cancer would also advance to a less critical perspective. But our prejudices against the disease are still alarmingly backwards. This might not necessarily be our fault—the way media depicts the disease tends to influence how we view it—but that does not mean we should continue what is clearly morally wrong discrimination against people with lung cancer. Let’s make the effort to “race for a cure” for this deadly disease so we can finally breath a sigh of relief that its on its way towards eradication.Gina Yu ’13, a Crimson editorial writer, is a biomedical engineering concentrator in Dunster House.

The last time the Harvard men’s basketball team won a game in Jadwin Gymnasium, Tommy Amaker—who had finished college eight months earlier—was a graduate assistant for Mike Krzyzewski at Duke, and none of the players he currently coaches had been born.So it has certainly been a while since February 3, 1989—the last time the Crimson left Princeton victorious.On Friday, Harvard is faced with that daunting test once again, and the stakes have almost never been higher.With four games remaining on its schedule, the Crimson (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) sits 1.5 games ahead of the Tigers (14-9, 7-2) in the Ivy League standings.If Harvard can win on ESPNU, it would move within one victory of clinching at least a share of its third consecutive Ivy League title and two wins within clinching the championship outright.
Because the Crimson will be a significant favorite in its final three games—at Penn and home against Cornell and Columbia—a victory against Princeton would mark a giant step towards a second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance for the squad. But if the Tigers win, they too will control their own destiny for a title share, setting up the possibility of the second one-game playoff between the two teams in the last three years.“I’m really excited, and I know our team’s excited,” sophomore wing Wesley Saunders said. “Whenever we play Princeton, it’s a great atmosphere. It’s always going to be a great game.”The last time the two teams met, on Feb. 16 at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard—which saw five players score in double-digits—knocked off the Tigers, 69-57. But earning a victory on the road will be an entirely different animal.“The excitement, the energy I’m sure is going to be as high as we’ve seen all year, and it should be,” Amaker said. “We’ll be confident, but we know it’s going to be a tremendous challenge.”If Harvard is going to conquer that challenge, it will need to find a way to contain Princeton forward Ian Hummer, who ranks second in the conference with 16.1 points and fifth with 6.3 rebounds per game.He, along with Saunders, is one of the two contenders for Ivy League Player of the Year. And for the second straight meeting, Hummer will be defended by the sophomore, on whom he has two inches and often tried to post up in their last matchup.“Hummer is as good of a player as we’ll face all season,” Amaker said. “We’ve got to make it hard for him, see if we can not give him easy baskets in the post.... I think that’s the key—you’re not bailing him out. You’ve got to really compete against him.”“He does have a height advantage, but it’s a good challenge,” added Saunders, who averages a league-high 16.7 points per game. “I think it should be fun.”Another point of emphasis will be three-point defense against Princeton’s bevy of shooters, led by 6’10” forward Will Barrett, who has hit a league-high 52.1 percent of his long balls. Sophomore guard Denton Koon, who has scored in double figures in 12 of his last 14 games, is also a dangerous perimeter threat.“They have some really good shooters,” Saunders said. “We really need to focus on trying to limit their attempts at threes.”

It’s tucked on the corner of Dunster and Winthrop Streets, bright and inviting. Plush couches surround a TV, and a re-run of Family Guy provides background noise for bantering guests. Round tables encourage dinnertime conversation, and computer carrels serve as pockets of privacy. The building is clean, spacious, and (most importantly) it welcomes them with open arms.“We try to make the shelter feel like home, and that involves getting to know the guests. Some guests are more receptive to that than others. Some people just want a place to stay and food to eat, and some guests want a personal connection,” Kelly A. Sullivan ’14, co-director of the Harvard Square Homeless shelter, says, describing her experience working at the shelter. Yet, the word “guest” echoes in her carefully articulate responses, never settling comfortably into place. Guest, visitor, boarder: No descriptor adequately encompasses the ambiguous status of those who frequent the shelter.Their program functions on three levels: the shelter itself, the resource advocates, and the street team. The staff runs a lottery to determine which potential guests will spend the night at the shelter, and the two dozen chosen are provided with meals cooked by Harvard students, toiletries, laundry, and the invaluable aid of the resource advocates.Three advocates chat with guests over dinner, offering both advice and company. Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14, director of the Resource Advocates Program, explains, “We try to meet the guests wherever they are coming from. If they are coming to us saying they want help applying for jobs, getting food stamps, or finding housing, we will work with them to achieve what they want.... If a guest doesn’t really want help, we will just talk to them.”Sometimes, conversation itself is the most valuable resource that can be offered. Rosenkrantz remembers one guest in particular. “He was at a very low place, and he was struggling,” she recalls. “I gave him a blanket and I did some research on his behalf. It wasn’t much, and it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary that a director or supervisor would not usually do. He was so grateful, and he made it very clear that an individual just taking time out of the day to even think about him was something that didn’t happen on a regular basis.”
Sullivan’s voice grows quiet when she describes the harrowing solitude that plagues the homeless. “When I was working at St. James Shelter [the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter’s summer incarnation] over the summer, we had a guest who panhandled in Harvard Square. When he first started staying with us he was very motivated and optimistic about his outlook,” she recalls.“Over the course of the summer you could see him get more despondent over his situation. Someone stole his guitar that he would bring into the shelter, and then someone stole his laptop so he didn’t know how to get a job. One night he didn’t come to the shelter, so I went out looking for him. He was just panhandling in front of The Coop. He was in a really low place. I was sitting with him as he was panhandling, and it put me in his position,” Sullivan says.“What is most devastating about this condition isn’t that people don’t give you whatever change is in their pocket, but that people just treat you as an object–they don’t make eye contact, they ignore you when you reach out to them,” Sullivan explains. “I can’t generalize for everyone who panhandles, but a lot of it is just wanting any form of acknowledgement.”Rosenkrantz explains that many students view homelessness as an inevitable part of the campus landscape, contending, “We can walk past the homeless and not even look down or anything. That is very much human nature to try to shut other people’s suffering out. We would never fault anyone for doing that, but I think that the people I work with are very passionate about fighting that mentality.”The shelter’s “Street Team” embodies this passion, traversing the Square on a nightly basis. Charles A. Hobbs ’13, co-director of the shelter, explains, “Every night, we have a group of three volunteers go out around the Square with food, blankets, hand warmers, and give them out to people who aren’t in the shelter that night but who might want a sandwich or someone to talk to.”These conversations grow into valuable relationships that exist both inside and outside of the shelter. “The fact that they come up to chat and want to engage with me make, even in the Square, me feel like I’m doing something right,” admits Charles. The barriers between volunteer and guests are broken down and replaced by an overpowering feeling of mutual respect and genuine care. Sullivan describes her first experience closing this fissure, remembering a guest that “would have intense philosophical discussions with the other guests. I could very well see him just as easily as a student. Going into Harvard, you think if you work hard, you get places... the shelter can be a very stressful place as you deal with poverty head on. You have to accept the fact that the world is not a meritocracy.”Acceptance becomes key in this line of work; volunteers must grapple with the unsettling truth that many of their guests will continue to struggle for years despite the students’ efforts. “Homelessness can be not only a temporary transition, but a long-term trap,” admits Hobbs. Sullivan acknowledges the unavoidable limits of their work, admitting, “We are an emergency shelter. We recognize that we aren’t providing a stable environment for the guests. It is something we have come to accept within the bounds.”However, the good memories can provide fuel when tougher scenarios emerge. “We try to hold onto successes,” confides Rosenkrantz. “They don’t come very frequently, because it is a cycle where we see the same people over and over again.”These energizing victories are found in successful transitions as well as small gestures between guests. Speaking with playful candor, Rosenkrantz’s stories of her relationships at the shelter mimic those of any normal friendship. She confides, “There is a guest at the shelter now who knows that I really like Fruit Roll-Ups, and so whenever he has some he’ll give one to me. Those little moments mean a lot.” Fumbling with her pen, she starts to laugh as she loses herself in another memory, recounting, “There was another guest who was an artist, and he would always be drawing in the shelter. I helped him get into a transitional program, and he gave me a piece of his art that is now hanging on my wall.”The success and longevity of the shelter is rooted in these stories. As the students flurry around the kitchen, the scene feels more like family dinner than charity or service. Before our interview comes to a close, Sullivan makes a point to add one more thing. “I want to emphasize the feel of the community,” she smiles. “It is definitely, besides my blocking group, the closest community I have at Harvard.”

One down, two to go.Before the start of the 2012-13 season, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (21-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) set its sights on bringing home the program’s first national title since 1999. The Crimson took a big step toward achieving its ultimate goal Tuesday, earning a share of the Ivy League championship with a 3-1 win over Yale. It was the team’s first title share since 2009.“It’s awesome,” said freshman Mary Parker, who scored two goals Tuesday. “The seniors have been…explaining how much it means to us, so even though I haven’t been able to experience it before, it was just as exciting.”Next up on Harvard’s checklist is claiming its first ECAC title since 2008. The Crimson will start navigating the eight-team field with a best-of-three series against Dartmouth on Friday.“Now it’s on to the postseason, where everybody starts 0-0 and works their way from there,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Our kids have had a tremendous season, and hopefully we can do some damage in the postseason.”
To date, the Crimson has played two wildly different games against the Big Green.At the Bright Hockey Center in November, the Crimson crushed Dartmouth, 6-0. Three Harvard players scored three points each, and co-captain goaltender Laura Bellamy recorded 26 saves in the shutout win.In the February rematch, Bellamy saw 26 shots again, but was only able to stop 24 of them as the two teams skated to a 2-2 draw on Dartmouth’s home ice.“In the first game, everything just sort of went our way,” Stone said. “The second game was just a great hockey game. We had lots of chances, they had good chances, goaltenders played well on both sides. I like the matchup a lot—two good teams trying to score goals, that makes for exciting hockey.”Since that second Big Green matchup, Harvard has struggled through the toughest stretch of its schedule, going 4-3-1 against competition that included three teams currently ranked in the top five.“We’ve played a lot of hockey,” Stone said. “We’re resilient, we’ve been able to focus and stay in the moment, and hopefully we can keep doing that this weekend.”During that stretch, the Crimson has dealt with a lack of scoring from co-captain Jillian Dempsey, who still leads the team with 23 goals. Dempsey has not found the back of the net in the last eight games. Her longest previous goal drought this season was two games.“She’s working hard, she’s doing the things for us off the puck that we really need, she just has a tremendous work ethic,” Stone said. “She just has to keep doing all the other things, and when she gets good looks at the net, I’m sure things will happen.”Harvard was also forced to play three games without junior first-line forward Kalley Armstrong, who missed a week of action while trying to get healthy before the playoffs before returning to the ice Tuesday.With Armstrong out and Dempsey struggling, several Crimson players took advantage of their extra responsibilities. Parker and sophomore Hillary Crowe each have accrued four goals in the last month of play, as many as either of them had to that point in the season. Sophomore Samantha Reber and freshmen Dylanne Crugnale and Jessica Harvey have also upped their levels of contribution.

Occasionally, faculty members ask students to draft a recommendation letter that they will then sign on. FM imagines one of these letters.[Name], or as I like to call her, best friend, is a fantastic student to work with. She reminds me so much of myself. We are so alike that sometimes I wonder if we’re the same person. For example, sometimes she finishes my sentences, or starts them, or does both.I just love advising [Name]. She doesn’t know this, but I specifically requested to be her mentor because I felt like she didn’t need very much advising—she already knows everything I can teach her.I think [Name] is a natural leader. I know I’m older and taller than she is, but I still look up to her and want to be just like her. She’s also great at empathizing with others. I feel like she really understands me personally, almost as if she can channel my spirit when she writes.And then don’t get me started about her skills. Look no further than [Name]’s writing abilities. Her main strength is fiction writing. She can make up stories from nothing at all. She can also use Word. I’ve seen her type; she’s fast!
She also has many, many friends. She’s great at laughing loudly when I walk by. I’ve totally noticed how funny she is because of that. Also, I completely don’t mind the parties that she has—if anything, I’m only upset that I’m not invited to them. I go to them all anyway.I have no hesitation in recommending [Name] for this position. That is why I wrote this recommendation myself. Personally, with no help whatsoever.[Faculty, Advisor, TF, Drew Faust]

Kirkland House roommates Kathleen J. Koenigs ’15 and Nosipho D. “Dichaba” McGinty ’15 met across their freshman fire door. Their friendship is a testament to the fact that, though mostly utilized for eavesdropping, a thin fire door occasionally provides more than just fodder for resentment—it can be the key to finding a best friend.KATHLEEN:“My friends from home and I made videos of our first week at college, and I was holding my laptop out walking around my room giving a tour. I have a super loud and bubbly voice. And so I guess I was super loud and I said, “Oh, look at this—we have a window and this is our bathroom and this is our sink!” I didn’t realize that the people next door could hear me the entire time. Later we had a Straus mixer where we got to meet people in the dorm. Apparently the people next door recognized my voice. We went down the line and said ‘Hi’ and they said to each other ‘Oh, that’s that girl!’ and apparently they thought I was super obnoxious and they were really put off. But then we met and we clicked right away. It was an immediate thing. From then on I basically stopped living in my own room. We actually tried to petition to get the fire door opened so I could just go straight across, but they said that wasn’t allowed. So instead I would go down all four flights of stairs across and up four flights of stairs. I probably spent about 75 percent of my time there.I remember it was my birthday, which is in October, so we were already really close at that point. It was midnight and they blindfolded me and sang happy birthday. I was so happy because no one had ever done that for me before. So I just came out with it and said ‘You know what? I think we should block together.’ It’s been great living with her. We get to share clothes, we get to share makeup and jewelry. We just live very well together, which is very lucky. We have similar ideals, but beyond that we are not very similar. We don’t have very similar interests, very similar backgrounds. She’s from Botswana, raised there for seven years. I’m from Colorado and have lived in the same house my whole life. But we somehow just sort of complete the other person. It’s funny because if I hadn’t met my fire door neighbors, then I would have had a completely different experience at Harvard, which is weird to think about. I don’t even know what the alternative would be because we are so close.”DICHABA:“We met maybe the third day of school, only a few days after we moved in. The first two days, my roommate and I had been hearing Kathleen’s voice through the fire door. I remember the first time I ever heard her she was giving a tour of her room to someone and she was like, “and this is my bathroom!” And my roommate and I thought. ‘Oh my God—we’re going to have to listen to this person for a whole year.’I think the next day was the first dorm-wide study break so that everyone could meet. And that’s how we met. We met her roommate and we said, ‘We can hear you through the fire door,’ and her roommate said, ‘Oh, that’s Kathleen,’ and then she pointed her out and we met her. Kathleen’s birthday is in October and I remember we were in Lamont that night: Kathleen, my other roommate, and myself. We surprised her by buying her a slice of cake and presenting it to her at midnight. And Kathleen freaked out and said, ‘Let’s block together!’ Though we didn’t talk about blocking officially until the next semester, we knew we’d be friends for a long time. We’re very different. She’s very loud and vivacious, which is definitely what my freshman roommate and I first noticed about her. It could have been something that was annoying if we didn’t know her, but because we know her that’s a huge part of what we love about her. I’m more quiet, but I think we kinda balance each other out in that way. We both like to dance and go out together. Our academic interests are very different and extracurriculars as well, but we’re very considerate of each other’s lives. She’s been a huge part of my Harvard experience.”

On Sunday evening, a team of faculty, staff, and students from across the University will gather in Lowell House to present their field research on a Hindu festival that is widely purported to be the largest gathering of humans in the world.Last month, more than 50 Harvard researchers traveled to Allahabad, India, to study the Kumbh Mela, a two-month-long religious affair that attracts tens of millions of visitors to a rotating location in India every three years.At the festival, teams composed of members from Harvard’s various schools conducted research on urbanization, public health, economics, religious performance, poverty, and crowd management as part of a yearlong coordinated by the South Asia Institute and the Harvard Global Health Institute,Now, a month after finishing their fieldwork, they are currently reflecting on their trip and drawing up plans to consolidate their research in palpable ways.LAYING THE GROUNDWORK
For most researchers who journeyed to India for the Kumbh Mela project, work began long before the festival started in January.Last summer, Graduate School of Design professor Rahul J. Mehrotra, principal investigator of his School’s team, began working with his researchers to monitor the construction of the festival. For each Kumbh Mela, organizers build a tent-city in a matter of weeks to accommodate the millions of pilgrims who attend.“We have been following the emergence of the city from its inception to its establishment and operation,” Mehrotra wrote in an email.Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies Diana L. Eck, who specializes in the sacred geography of India, taught a course in the South Asian Studies department this past fall centered on the Kumbh Mela in preparation for the research project.“We did as much reading and study of the Kumbh Mela as possible,” said Eck, who was one of the main leaders of the Harvard trip. “The course in the fall was a way of attracting students who might be interested.”Eck said the sheer size and complexity of the festival necessitated such advance planning.THINKING ACROSS DISCIPLINESThough the focus of each researcher’s work differed based on individual interests, students and faculty alike said that interdisciplinary collaboration enhanced their work at the Kumbh Mela.“One of the things that this [project] has really exemplified is that there are many things that you can study that are going to be better studied if you are looking at it with people from other disciplines and other schools,” Eck said.For many undergraduates who went on the trip, the opportunity to work with researchers across many disciplines was the main highlight of their experience at the festival.

To the editor:The editorial “An Unexploited Union” misrepresents the contract negotiations between the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and the University, and it unfairly blames the union for the stall in negotiations.The editorial misleads readers about the dispute over wages. While HUCTW workers are paid above-average rates for their industry, considering that the Harvard University library system is one of the<a href=""http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22""> largest and most prestigious in the world, and considering that many librarians have master’s degrees and Ph.D’s, HUCTW’s pay scales are hardly laudable. In 2011, the lowest pay grade began at only<a href=""http://www.huctw.org/economy/salary_table_2011.pdf""> $15.09 an hour, barely above the<a href=""http://www.cambridgema.gov/personnel/livingwagefactsheetandlivingwageordinance.aspx""> living wage for the city of Cambridge.The editorial also fails to mention the largest conflict in the negotiations so far—healthcare. HUCTW has proposed a<a href=""http://huctw-org.unionsrus.org/negotiations/2012/fact_sheet_hc.pdf""> cost-neutral progressive health care plan, yet the University continues to argue against these<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/5/union-letter-health-care/""> practices even though they benefit both workers and the financial health of the university.It is true that these negotiations have gone on for far too long; months after the previous contract expired,<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/1/18/huctw-negotiation-contract-mediators/""> three mediators have had to assist in the contract negotiations. Yet Harvard, not HUCTW, ought to be blamed for this impasse, for it has been unwilling to compromise on wages and healthcare.
Last week, the Cambridge City Council passed a<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/19/city-council-back-union/""> resolution in support of HUCTW stating, “Negotiations that ensure a consistent salary increase program and affordable healthcare solutions for union employees are essential for the sustenance of Cambridge’s local economy, community, and employees therein.” Indeed, even the Crimson<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/3/harvard-huctw-contract-wages/""> supported higher wages for HUCTW just this past October.

Capuano—will <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/events/144467479052111/?fref=ts"">rally at 5 p.m. in Memorial Church for a fair contract.The Crimson’s editorial presents an uncritical perspective on the contract negotiation process and needlessly maligns a union that is fighting for decent wages, affordable healthcare, and workplace dignity for its over 4,600 members.Gabriel H.

I graduated from Harvard College in December, just in time to start work at a state psychiatric hospital in my home state of South Carolina. South Carolina has endured the <a href=""http://www.nami.org/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm?ContentFileID=147763"">deepest budget cuts to mental health of any state in the United States over the past four years, and the hospital where I work has more empty beds than filled ones. We have three psychiatrists for the whole hospital—and one of them is quitting next week. There is a long waiting list of severely mentally ill people who need treatment we may not be able to provide, simply because we do not have the resources to do so.It is in the context of my new job that I have been hearing about the surging interest among Harvard students in demanding reform of University Mental Health Services. As someone who received a significant amount of mental health treatment at University Health Services and as someone who spent much time advocating for mental health during my time at Harvard, I want to offer my brief perspective.As anyone who knows me can confirm, I am beyond thrilled at the attention mental health is receiving around the country, despite the etiology of that attention. While at Harvard, I was deeply involved in bringing attention to the mental health services available on campus. I am glad to see that Harvard students have turned their energies to mental health in a new and forceful way. Yet, I believe that students at Harvard need a reality check on the relative quality of services to which they have access.According to a clinician at UHS, there is so much demand for mental health on Harvard’s campus, that even if UHS doubled the size of MHS tomorrow, there still would not be enough resources to go around. This is absolutely unacceptable. This should simply not be the case at one of the best universities in the country. It is especially worrisome because Harvard College is a residential community, and many students expect to have all their healthcare needs met within that community. Of course, this sets Harvard apart from many other colleges in the country, where students must look outside the university setting and navigate the local community in finding the healthcare resources they need.There are also, as has been mentioned numerous times, undue complexities in the relationship between the College and UHS for students who want to receive mental health services on campus without interrupting their studies. I encountered these problems repeatedly in my time at Harvard.  I didn’t know whether I should consider my resident dean a confidante or an agent of the Ad Board. At one point, after taking a medical leave, I was notified two days before I had been planning to return to campus that the Ad Board had denied my application for readmission. I could go on. The bureaucratic complexities of Harvard make things harder than they have to be on students dealing with major mental health issues. This is something that certainly needs to be addressed.
At the end of the day, though, I am thankful that UHS was there for me when I needed it. I was able to receive extended treatment at McLean Hospital, a Harvard affiliate that is consistently ranked one of the <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings/psychiatry"">best psychiatric hospital in the country. Although the first therapist I saw at UHS seemed to be falling asleep on me, I found other clinicians who gave the highest quality care I can imagine. It is impossible to know, of course, but I am not sure I would still be alive today if it hadn’t for the mental health treatment I received at Harvard.This level of care is not available in most locations: It wasn’t for me when I was away from the College. A two-day hospitalization in South Carolina cost me many thousands of dollars and provided me with nothing but memories of unsympathetic and unprofessional staff members cursing at annoying patients. I was lucky even to get in. At this moment, there are people waiting for beds, many in local emergency rooms, to free up in the hospital where I work, even though over half the beds are empty due to a dual lack of funds and psychiatrists. In total contrast, a Harvard student can walk in to UHS at any time, 24/7, and see someone immediately. If the issue is one of suicidality or psychosis, or is immediately dangerous, then that student can be admitted quickly and efficiently to a nearby hospital, most likely McLean.I realize many have different perspectives on this issue. I know that there is much that can be improved at Harvard on the mental health front. But when protesting and criticizing Harvard mental health services, we should remember simultaneously that, believe it or not, we have access to some of the highest quality mental health services in the world.Seth A. Riddley ’12, a History and Science concentrator, lived in Mather House. This is part of a semester-long series organized by SMHL (Student Mental Health Liaisons) to encourage conversation around mental health.

Several researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have penned their names to a petition that calls for the Food and Drug Administration to evaluate and act upon the health effects of climbing sugar levels in soda and sweetened beverages.Created by the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington D.C., the petition suggests new policy measures such as limiting soda serving sizes or requiring warning labels on soda products to avert some of the health risks associated with soda consumption.According to the Center’s recent press release, the 15 teaspoons of sugar in an average 20-ounce cola are well over the recommended daily intake for men—nine teaspoons—and more than twice that of the six teaspoons recommended for women.Because soda contains high levels of sugar and no additional nutritional value, researchers have concluded that soda contributes to health issues such as obesity, and cardiovascular disease.However, the impact of soda on health goes largely unnoticed by consumers. It is easy to over-consume soda products because despite their high sugar content, they do not satisfy hunger the way food does, said Walter C. Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at HSPH.
Willett, who signed the petition, said that the policy changes proposed may take time to go into effect, since a number of organizations with close connections to the soda industry may use their lobbying power to influence the FDA’s opinion.This is not the first time that researchers at the HSPH have called the FDA to action. In the 1990s, HSPH affiliates submitted a petition to the FDA to look into the health effects of trans fats, and in 2006, the FDA mandated the inclusion of trans-fat warning labels on food packages.Willett said he thinks ignoring petition on soda consumption would be a grave mistake by the FDA—one that could affect youth health especially.“What’s really happening on the ground is that a whole generation of children are being barraged by promotion to drink these beverages and consumption has gone way up,” said Willett.Clarifying or imposing restrictions on sugar quantities will not impinge upon the public’s right to make their own nutritional choices, added Willett. Instead, he said, it will give members of society the “choice of living a healthy life.”

When I call my brother to say that I’m thinking of writing about him in the magazine, he tells me he’s in Vail for the weekend with his new girlfriend. They rented skis and are staying in a small cabin; it’s cold, really cold. I explain to him how this Endpaper thing works—that I have a page to write just about anything—and that I’m thinking he might feature prominently.“So it’s gonna be a page all about me?” Owen asks. “Sounds pretty sweet.” Then he promptly drops his phone in the snow. After a few muffled seconds: “Baxter, you there?”*****To my brother, I am no longer Rebecca. She left a handful of years ago (neither one of us remembers precisely when) to be replaced with Baxter: her slightly more eccentric, playful counterpart. It happened over a dinner conversation—one of those weeknight family affairs in our yellow-walled Manhattan apartment. Maybe we had just returned home sweaty and mud-stained from soccer practice, or else had been working on homework through the early evening. It may have been fajita night. Most of the details aren’t important, though. Except for these: Owen called me Baxter, I told him no—that it sounded more like a dog’s name than a person’s—he laughed, and the name stuck.It began like just like that, as a way for Owen to annoy his older sister. To get back at her for all the years when her three-years-older self was able to pin him to the living room carpet and tickle him ’till he begged for mercy. But the title soon grew more serious. The nickname was catchy; even I didn’t deny that. My dad began to adopt it, and within a few months Owen had ceased calling me anything else. Baxter has a certain ring to it.
However, I generally stayed away from broadcasting the name. I suppose I viewed it in a similar way as I viewed the baby photos sprinkled around my house: mostly embarrassing, and somewhat endearing in the right context. Baxter was alright for family, but that was about it. As its usage became more commonplace, though, I would occasionally tell my friends about Baxter—bring it up as an entertaining family anecdote over dinner—and a silly grin would break out over their faces as they promised that they would never be able to keep a straight face if they ever actually heard me called Baxter.I’ve asked my brother to explain the name’s origins to me a few times before, a request that always makes him smile. He eagerly obliges. The evolution went like this: Rebecca—Becca—Bec—Bax—Baxt—Baxter. “It makes total sense,” he always explains. “Also, it just sounds so much better. Baxt-er,” he will say slowly, emphasizing the twang in the first syllable.For Owen, Baxter has moved from the realm of nickname to that of name. It is the identity he created for me, and it is one that I have grown into over the years.Owen graduated last June, and it was an extravagant outdoor affair on the dew-damp grass of his Bronx high school’s football field. There were speeches and roses pinned to lapels, boys looking uncomfortable when their grandmothers kissed them on the head, girls beaming as their too-tall heels sunk into the mud.I was on camera duty at the time, entrusted to obediently follow Owen around and take photos of him alongside friends and teachers. As we wandered, classmate after classmate approached us, gave Owen a congratulatory hug, and then turned to me with small upturned smiles. Their eyes lit up: “Is this Baxter?”The first few times this happened, I reached out for a handshake and said, “Hi, I’m Rebecca.” I wished to correct them as unobtrusively as possible. But eventually I realized that in Owen’s world, Rebecca no longer exists. So I gave up and just began saying, “Yep, nice to meet you.”It was my way of saying: Okay Owen, you won.*****“Anything else you want me to add?” I ask. Owen tells me no, so I ask how Vail is going, if he’s gotten to the double black diamonds yet. He chuckles as he describes more questionably accurate details of his whereabouts. (Owen cannot afford to fly himself to Vail, and has never introduced me to a girlfriend.) The snow does crunch around him though, and Owen’s gloved hand continues to struggle maintaining its grip on the phone.“Call back any time if there’s a need for an interview,” he notes before I hang up. “I’m here all day.”—Rebecca F. Elliott ’14, a Crimson magazine chair, is a literature concentrator in Winthrop House. She is not a dog, but sometimes she laughs like one.

Photographers surrounded the stage, wielding cameras like semi-automatics.  The occasional campus cop made rounds through the crowd. I was sandwiched between two strangers in the back of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. Trapped in my folding chair, I was an easy target. If the large and bulky-dressed man next to me had a gun, exit would be impossible.Luckily, I was not the target. During last Wednesday’s forum at the Institute of Politics, all of the photographers’ guns were pointed at NRA President David Keene.I can’t say that I support the NRA; guns (even water guns) give me nightmares. But I’m starting to see why Keene supports the Bill of Rights. He probably could have used a gun to defend himself, or the right to remain silent.Throughout his conversation with John King and subsequent Q&amp;A session with Harvard students, Keene was attacked from every angle. Students fired questions like snipers strategically placed around the stage, on the stairs of the forum room, and balconies. I’m pretty sure some students were hiding out under the stage, just to make sure all bases were covered.Students used public opinion statistics, past inconsistencies, and words like “propaganda” and “completely inappropriate.” They appealed to our founding fathers; would they still support an unrestrained Second Amendment in a world of assault rifles? Keene tried to defend himself by referencing problems with mental illness and the occasional deer-hunting anecdote. Those defenses did little to dismantle the palpable fury.
When moderator John King asked the audience who supported the idea that no one should be able to own a gun, hundreds of hands shot into the air. In another state, Keene might have been crowned a hero, a man protecting our fundamental rights. Not here. To us, he was the man responsible for promoting armed guards in schools, hassling Congress, and making it easier for gun-related violence to continue.When I told my dad that I was going to see the president of the National Rifle Association, he asked me to go easy on him—to say something nice, compliment his glasses.  “He is going to face a lot of flack,” my dad said, and I thought, rightfully so.As I sat in the JFK forum room that was filled with animosity, I was comforted by the fact that my classmates were unarmed. They could do enough damage with their words alone.

Last Wednesday at the Cantab Lounge’s weekly poetry slam open mic, no one snapped and hardly anyone wore black. The doors opened at 7:15 p.m., and when I arrived 15 minutes later, the only space  that remained was a particularly sticky square foot of the floor. The black-walled basement was somehow more divey than the upper floor and smelled like illicit smoke.The patrons holding plastic cups of water and beer and wilted slices of pizza were all, from an unscientific poll, repeat visitors. Everyone’s features were unspecific in the reddish light and no one took off their puffy jackets even in the packed room. Tonight we would hear from poets who had conscienciously signed-up in advance, waitlisted ones who hadn’t been as diligent, the headliner, Wes Hazard, and the eight competitors in the elimination-round “speed slam.” I could spot the competitors around the room, still scrawling into legal pads and Moleskines, all nerves, oblivious to the emcee.The first, sacrificial entrant finally got up around 8:00 p.m. He read off a poem from an iPhone, his voice lapsing, more than once, into a Southie accent. Will Hunting was mentioned. The second read uncannily like T.S. Eliot circa “Prufrock.” The next few poets were likewise dissimilar: a father in a bowling shirt, a man in a sweater he admitted was accidentally bought without reading the “3” in “3XL,” a young woman in a beanie and plastic glasses. Once, the emcee accidentally subbed “poetaster” for (I think) “poet-master.” It was a slip, but not a Freudian one.Some dozen poets in, I convinced myself that I had found the reason that people write metered plays. Spoken word, close as it is to unfiltered speech, is nevertheless strongly patterned, metered, rhymed, alliterated—not just by the virtuosos, but also by the absolute novices. It is not so far a cry from this, I thought, to five acts in iambic pentameter.And then—the testicle poem: “Testicle Pain is Only Fun If It’s Not Yours.” This for the full, allotted 180 seconds. If a poem is, in fact, the best words in the best order, then an awful lot of said words were: “testicle.”
I had to duck out before the speed slam, rustling a dozen puffy coats on the way. The Cantab, I learned while leaving, is this year’s home of the National Poetry Slam. But just before I turned the doorknob, a sudden hush in the crowd gave me pause. The very recently outgrown teenager at the mic held neither iPhone nor laptop nor legal pad, which was immediately promising. He launched into “This Might Hurt a Little but It’s Ok Because You’re a Bitch,” a vicious aubade (two words I’ve never had to combine). It was perhaps the most aurally pleasing diatribe I’ve ever heard, and between his refusal to pause for breath and the crowd’s adoration, I was quite sad to leave.

After two years of revamping its virtual presence, the Institute of Politics will launch its latest social media initiative next week to better connect undergraduate members with students beyond the Institute.Under the student-run “Digital Brigade” campaign, a group of Harvard undergraduates will use various social media outlets, including Twitter and Facebook, to publicize IOP events.About 15 students have pledged to man the Digital Brigade, but IOP Student Communications Director Kathryn G. Walsh ’14, who is managing the group, hopes to soon double that number.The Digital Brigade is the most recent of a series of social and digital media upgrades implemented by the IOP to modernize its mission of inspiring “undergraduates to consider careers in politics and public service.”Improvements began two years ago when the IOP’s governing body—the Senior Advisory Committee, chaired by Caroline B. Kennedy ’80—requested an audit of the IOP’s internal operations.
The strategic audit revealed flaws in the IOP’s communications strategy that staff have since attempted to remedy, according to IOP Director of Communications and Marketing Esten Perez. When Walsh joined the IOP her freshman spring, for example, the Institute’s use of social media was largely under the radar.“I couldn’t have told you if we had a Twitter,” she said.Twitter now plays a noticeable role in IOP Forums, an improvement championed by Kellie A. Ryan, the IOP’s first social media coordinator.Since Ryan joined the IOP in October, subscriptions to the IOP’s YouTube channel have more than tripled. Last month, Ryan also oversaw the launch of the IOP’s blog, which currently has 5,600 views.The IOP is using its digital campaign as a mechanism for reaching out to students “beyond the IOP, beyond Harvard,” Ryan said.Social media also gives more students access to the Institute, said IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, calling the initiative “an attempt to address the reality that people have short attention spans.”“People aren’t likely to sit at a computer for 90 minutes to watch a Forum,” Grayson said.This realization inspired the “3 With IOP” series that now airs on YouTube. Each segment is three minutes long and poses three questions to IOP fellows and visitors.“[Social media] amplifies the ability to share my expertise and my experiences with a broader group of students,” said current IOP Fellow Karen Hughes, a communications expert and one of former President George W. Bush’s top advisors.The IOP plans to continue elevating the quality and quantity of its virtual presence, Perez said.As the initiative moves forward, Walsh said that she hopes to see the IOP use online strategies to clarify its mission and program offerings for students.—Staff writer Steven R.

As parents of students in the Class of 2014 pack their bags and finalize travel arrangements for Junior Parents Weekend this coming Friday and Saturday, Harvard Square establishments are preparing for a flood of visitors by hiring extra staff and hiking up prices.General Manager of The Charles Hotel Alex Attia said that the hotel will be approximately 90 percent full this weekend with rooms costing at least $300, which is $100 higher than prices later in March.Other hotels in the Cambridge area are also close to capacity. The Courtyard by Marriott is nearly sold out, and the Sheraton Commander Hotel had only one room with a king-size bed as of Wednesday night.According to Attia, the number of parents staying in The Charles over Junior Parents Weekend has remained relatively constant over the years.“We usually do very well,” Attia said.
Only Harvard’s Commencement weekend attracts higher numbers of family members to the area, according to Attia. During that time, The Charles functions at full occupancy, and the cost of a room increases to over $800 per night, he added.Attia said that The Charles will stock up on towels and increase the number of waiters in the hotel’s restaurants to accommodate the higher volume of guests. He hopes to ensure that patrons receive their food as quickly and efficiently as possible.“Parents want to spend time with their children instead of waiting for their food to arrive,” he said.Unlike last year, the Harvard Square Business Association did not encourage restaurants in Harvard Square to come up with a special menu for the weekend, according to Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson. Nevertheless, restaurants are anticipating an influx of guests as students leave the dining halls to enjoy a meal on their parents’ dime.Managers and event coordinators from Sandrine’s Bistro and UpStairs on the Square confirmed that they are expecting more customers, and staff at First Printer Restaurant Bar &amp; Grill said they will tailor their live band and Sunday brunch schedule to accommodate students and their parents.“The restaurants love having families here,” Jillson said.Just like the establishments they will soon patronize, parents of many juniors have been planning their time in Cambridge in advance.“My parents booked the hotel rooms in November because they anticipated a lot of demand,” said Jordan A. Feyko ’14.The parents of Kevin F. Hernandez ’14 booked their flights in January when he was home for winter break and will be staying at The Charles this weekend.“They’ll never miss a chance to see me,” he said.—Laya Anasu contributed to the reporting of this story.—Staff writer Julia K.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.February 28, 1928: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1928/2/28/new-memorial-chapel-to-rise-in/"">New Memorial Chapel to Rise in Honor of Harvard's War HeroesThat the proposed University war memorial will definitely take the form of a new chapel to be erected in the Yard on the site of the present Appleton Chapel was made known officially last night. The announcement comes as a result of the passing of a resolution by the President and Fellows of Harvard College yesterday morning. The resolve was then submitted by the Corporation to the Board of Overseers at their meeting yesterday afternoon. It was voted upon, accepted, and placed on file. A committee will be designated to draw up plans and make the necessary investigations.The adoption of the resolution to build a war memorial chapel culminates a movement for a University memorial which began early in the World War, as soon as the deaths of Harvard men were reported. It will require the demolition of the present chapel, but inside the new memorial there will be a small chapel which will be called Appleton Chapel.<!--more-->
February 26, 1940: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1940/2/26/crimson-mob-swamps-folies-queen-in/"">Crimson Mob Swamps Folies Queen in Mad Publicity StuntFifty Harvard men, Stan Brown's Crimsonians, the head of the Yardling Dating Bureau and his assistants, the Bachelors' Club, and a box of roses turned out yesterday afternoon at the South Station to greet the New Haven Express, which bore Mademoiselle Paris of the Folies Bergeres and 60 beautiful girls 60.This ""spontaneous"" reception originated in the fertile brain of Ruben Rabinovitz, press agent for the Folies, and everybody connected with the University who wanted a little publicity joined the mad procession.February 27, 1953: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1953/2/27/furry-denies-all-present-ties-with/"">Furry Denies All Present Ties with Any Red GroupsAssociate Professor of Physics Wendell H. Furry, who early yesterday refused to tell the House Un-American Activities Committee whether he is or ever has been a Communist, declared last night, ""I am not a member of the Communist Party, I have no personal knowledge as to whether or not there is any Communist Party activity at Harvard of anywhere else.""Furry, who has been named by three earlier witness before the House Committee as a member of a Harvard ""Red cell"" in the 1930's, did not say whether he had belonged to the Communist Party in the past.He refused to answer all questions pertaining to Communism or Communist activities under the provisions of the first and fifth amendments of the Constitution.February 24, 1961: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1961/2/24/exams-final-papers-or-revise-the-system/"">Exams, Final Papers—Or Revise The SystemAn ancient (and perhaps apocryphal) College rule once entitled students taking final or midyear examinations to receive a mug of ale at the end of the first hour. This sympathetic gesture seems rather anomalous for the strait-laced old Puritans who supposedly made it. Perhaps even they, despite their conviction that ""all work and no play sends Jack to Heaven,"" had some unconscious qualms about the examination system.Progress has eliminated beer-quaffing in Memorial Hall, but it has also done away with universal agreement among Faculty members that examinations are a Good Thing. A few have gone so far as to suggest that examinations be abolished entirely, while many have ceased to regard formal testing as the only way to evaluate students' performance. These attitudes have produced a notable increase in the number of courses using term papers as a substitute for the once-ubiquitous ""finals.""February 24, 1971: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1971/2/24/the-great-pre-med-boom-pthe-desire/"">The Great Pre-Med BoomThe desire to be a doctor is suddenly grabbing hold of more and more Harvard and Radcliffe students.Although official statistics are still unavailable, premedical advisors at three Harvard Houses estimated independently that the number of Harvard seniors applying to medical school this year exceeded last year's figure by 20 per cent.At Radcliffe the number of applicants has risen from 30 two years ago to about 50 this year.—Compiled by Nikita Kansra and Amy L.

Beginning this September, visitors to the Radcliffe Yard will be greeted by the usual  flowers and park benches—and a newly installed exhibit of original student art.In October, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study launched an annual University-wide art competition allowing students to solicit proposals and designs for an installation to be displayed in the garden bordering Brattle Street in the Radcliffe Yard.The winning entry will win a $5,000 prize, as well as funding to install the design.“Our mission as the Radcliffe Institute is to advance work beyond the classroom, beyond the usual curriculum, and so I see the garden as a way of doing that for the arts,” Radcliffe Dean Lizabeth Cohen said.Cohen said she was excited about the student response to the new competition. Several College students and many from the Graduate School of Design entered the contest.
After hearing about the competition through an email list, Madelynne A. Hays ’13 and Oliver Luo ’13 decided to work together to create a design to enter in the competition. Their entry features a multifaceted dome with two-way mirrors intended to allow visitors to see multiple reflections of themselves when they view the display.“Our common idea is to sort of make a work in response to the current situation with the creation of multiple personalities, like the multiple profiles a person could have on the Internet,” Luo said. “We wanted to make a work that would be interactive and bring the people who are visiting this site a greater awareness of that sense of exposure, sort of self-reflection.”Avery W. Williamson ’13 submitted a plan for a light installation using warm, white LED lights. Her interest in the project stemmed from a history research seminar for which she researched Harvard’s past relationship with slave labor. The focus of her design is for visitors to think of “labor, light, and the fluidity of space,” she said.“If chosen, my hope is that people can walk through the installation space and consider the different hands that constructed Harvard,” she said.According to Radcliffe Institute spokesperson Alison Franklin, the winning design will be announced in either April or May.The selected installation will be constructed during July and August before going on display in September. The exhibit will remain until June 2014.—Staff writer Madeline R. Conway can be reached at mconway@college.harvard.edu.

While the Harvard men’s basketball team looks to clinch a share of the Ivy League title with two wins at Princeton and Penn, March Madness has already started for other Crimson winter squads. Women’s hockey hosts Dartmouth tonight for Game 1 of the ECAC quarterfinals while women’s swimming and diving has already begun its three-day defense of its Ivy League title at Princeton. In addition, men’s hockey looks to wrap-up its regular season at the Bright with contests against No. 1 Quinnipiac and Princeton while women’s basketball hopes to make some noise against the Ancient Eight’s top two teams as it hosts Princeton and Penn. Here’s a look at some of the big numbers heading into the weekend.
<a name=""jump"">
Men’s Basketball
2003: The last year in which the Harvard men’s basketball has beaten Princeton on the road. A visiting Crimson squad defeated the Tigers, 67-61, on January 31, 2003.
1985: The last year in which a Harvard team has beaten both Princeton and Penn on the road. The 1984- 85 Crimson beat the Tigers, 60-50, on January 11, 1985, before traveling to Philadelphia the next day to edge the Quakers, 77-75.
Women’s Hockey
399: Career wins for Harvard women’s hockey coach Katey Stone, an NCAA Division I record.
1998: The last year in which the Crimson failed to advance past the first round of the ECAC tournament.
Women’s Swimming and Diving
3: Number of times that freshman Kendall Crawford has lowered Harvard’s 100-yard backstroke record. She enters the Ivy League Swimming and Diving Championship Meet as the Ancient Eight’s top seed in both the 100 and 200 backstrokes.
10: Number of events at the Ivy League Championships in which Crimson swimmers hold the top seeds. The meet comprises 19 swimming events and two diving events.
Men’s Hockey
0: Number of times in which the Harvard men’s hockey team has finished the regular season last in the ECAC. With two games left, the Crimson currently sits at the bottom of the conference, three points behind next-closest Colgate.
2004: The last year in which Harvard has defeated a No. 1-ranked team. The Crimson topped No. 1 Boston College, 3-1, at the Bright Hockey Center on Nov. 17, 2004.
Women’s Basketball
8: Ivy League Rookie of the Week nods for sophomore Temi Fagbenle. The British national teamer has also collected two Ivy League Player of the Week honors over the course of the season.
7: Victoria Lippert’s position on Harvard’s all-time scorers list. The senior is 44 points behind former teammate Brogan Berry ’12 for the sixth spot.

UPDATED: March 1, 2013, at 8:26 a.m.Members of Harvard College Queer Students and Allies and the Harvard Libertarian Forum gathered Thursday evening to seal and send off a box filled with 1,624 letters for the Food and Drug Administration.The letters, signed by approximately a quarter of Harvard undergraduates, protested a government policy that universally bans men who have had sex with other men from donating blood.Over a six-week period last semester, the campaigners visited every dining hall to collect signatures and raise awareness among students.The policy, a holdover from the era of the AIDS epidemic, effects a lifetime ban on blood donation for males who have had sex with another male since 1977.
The members of both organizations decided to start the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/11/movement-gay-men-blood-donating/"">campaign when they noticed that despite frequent blood drives at Harvard, there was little dialogue on campus about the ban, which they called “archaic,” “judgmental,” and “ineffective.”“Students were extremely receptive, and [for] others that weren’t, we had a chance to engage with the issue, which is really valuable, too,” said Benjamin L. DeVore ’15, a former political co-chair of the QSA.Though they acknowledged that theirs was an unusual partnership, both groups said that their interests aligned perfectly on the issue.“We come from the standpoint that the government shouldn’t be intervening in medical affairs,” said Corinne H. Curcie ’15, president of the Libertarian Forum.Every unit of donated blood gets tested for HIV, said Curcie, who also referred to a study by the American Medical Association that called the policy “ethically inconsistent” with the FDA’s other regulations.The American Red Cross and the American Association of Blood Banks have also supported a repeal of the ban.The letter Harvard students sent to the FDA cited the United Kingdom as an example, where replacing a similar lifetime ban with a one-year ban for men who are sexually active with other men increased blood donations by an estimated two percent.“We just want to make it a smart policy,” De Vore said about the FDA rules.—Staff writer Yen H.

During a trip to Washington this week, University President Drew G. Faust met with prominent lawmakers, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, to argue against cuts to federal research funding that will take effect if Congress does not pass a budget deal sometime on Friday.The cuts, collectively known as sequestration, are designed to slash 8.2 percent of most non-defense discretionary programs and will <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/25/university-braces-spending-cuts/"">impact Harvard’s sponsored research funding streams from Washington, which totaled over $650 million in fiscal year 2012.Faust, who called scientific research “a foundation of our success as a nation for the past 60 years,” said her trip had three primary purposes. The first was to greet new members of Congress, particularly Harvard alumni. The second was to explain the negative consequences of cuts to research funding, which she said propels both international competitiveness and economic prosperity. Finally, Faust said she sought to understand different viewpoints on sequestration and hone her own arguments against austerity measures by meeting with members from both parties as well as members of the executive branch.In addition to McConnell, Kennedy, and Kaine, Faust met with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, U.S. Representative David E. Price of North Carolina, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, and Secretary of the Navy Ray E. Mabus. She also attended a lunch with several other representatives with varying levels of seniority at the Capitol.“Everybody has been engaged in the conversation,” Faust said, adding that she received “a lot of advice” on how to argue for robust support of scientific research as persuasively as possible.
Faust said that <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/13/harvard-delegation-congress-lobbying/"">Harvard alumni can be especially helpful for the University’s outreach in Washington because they understand Harvard’s mission and the importance of research.Members of the “Harvard family,” she said, “can be very effective spokespeople.”Faust has previously traveled to Washington to lobby on behalf of Harvard and its researchers.During debates over the allocation of <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/11/faust-talks-to-us-senate-university/"">stimulus funds in 2008 and 2009, she pushed for funding for research as a source of economic growth.Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president for public affairs and communications, said before Faust’s visit that whether or not sequestration occurs, Faust’s visit to the Capitol can help to encourage focus on research funding in the long term.“Policy dialogue is ongoing in Washington, even as deadlines loom,” Heenan said.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nikitakansra@college.harvard.edu.

This weekend marks the last road stint for Harvard of the 2012-13 season. With games at Princeton and Penn on deck for this weekend, the Crimson has the chance to seal its place at the top of the Ivy League standings with back-to-back wins. The Crimson’s basketball beat writers answer five questions about this weekend’s match-ups.

1) Riding a four game win-streak, what kind of momentum does the Crimson have going into this weekend?
JSG: After last Saturday's win over Yale, I feel like Harvard has finally shaken off some of its hesitancy and is hungry for two more wins this weekend. The Bulldog match-up tested Harvard—the home team fought back against the Crimson, even taking the lead at one point, forcing Harvard to continually seek new ways of scoring and regain the advantage. After a huge first half from sophomore Wesley Saunders, the Crimson was able to turn to others for its offensive output in the second period, an option that was less available earlier in the season. The fact that this game was against perennial-rival Yale made a difference, too—the squad got the big win in front of an even bigger crowd, and was even able to land Saunders' first-half dunk on SportsCenter. All of this, I believe, will add to both the team's confidence level and momentum going into this weekend's dates with the Killer P's. If you had asked me this question after last Friday's game against Brown, where the Crimson temporarily fumbled away a large advantage in the second period due to an uncharacteristically poor shooting night, my answer would have been radically different. But wins help. SportsCenter helps. And, of course, beating Yale will always augment a team's momentum going forward.
2) What were the main keys to Harvard's success in its 69-57 win over Princeton at Lavietes two weeks ago?
HS: The keys to Harvard's win over the Tigers were being efficient on offense, limiting Ian Hummer, and defending the perimeter. The Crimson shot 48 percent from the field to Princeton's 40 percent, and had five players in the double digits. Sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith led the way with 14 points on five-for-five shooting from the field, and Harvard outshot the Tigers across the board. With top scoring sophomore Wes Saunders given the task of guarding Princeton's Ian Hummer, the Crimson had to find its offensive spark elsewhere. Saunders stayed tough on Hummer, who put up 18 points but was limited to 7-for-14 shooting. Smith's six blocks and seven rebounds were huge in breaking up Hummer and the Tigers' offensive rhythm. Finally, Harvard focused on limiting Princeton from deep. The Tigers--the second best three point shooting team in the Ivy League after Harvard--sunk four of their 11 shots, while the Crimson hit 7.
3) What should Harvard look out for this time around in its away match-up against the Tigers?
DF: If the Crimson is going to break its two-decade drought at Jadwin Gym on Friday, it will need to play its best game of the season. Since Harvard last defeated the Tigers, Princeton posted its two most impressive performances of the year in double-digit road victories over Cornell and Columbia. The Tigers posted a +34 point margin on the same trip the Crimson posted a -18 on just two weeks ago. In that same time span, Tiger star forward Ian Hummer has been on fire. Hummer made 17 of his 23 shots taken during the trip, compiling eight assists against just three turnovers and scoring 40 points on the weekend. In Lavietes, the strong interior defense of Kenyatta Smith and Moundou Missi—who rejected Hummer three times—helped Harvard force the Tigers to the perimeter, where they shot only four for 11 from behind the arc. Playing at home, the Crimson should expect Princeton to come out firing. Against both Cornell and Columbia, the Tigers asserted themselves early and entered halftime with double-digit leads. It will be Hummer’s last weekend at Jadwin Gym to cap off an illustrious career for the forward, who leads his team in points, rebounds, assists, and blocks. The crowd will be ready and with the Tigers will be looking to seize their opportunity to get back into the Ivy race, the Crimson has to play forty minutes of its best basketball.
4) How can Harvard make sure to easily handle the Quakers after a sure-fight against Princeton the night before?
MK: Perimeter defense will be the key to a Harvard victory over Penn this Saturday. When the teams last met, the Crimson clamped down on the Quakers' talented guards Tony Hicks and Miles Cartwright, holding the duo to 15 points on 5 of 21 shooting. If the Crimson can come up with a similar performance this weekend, Harvard should earn a season sweep of Penn for the first time since the 2010-11 season.
5) If Harvard wins out this weekend, what can Crimson fans expect for the rest of the season?
CEC: As is probably obvious by now, this is a huge weekend for the Crimson.
With two wins, Harvard would clinch at least a share of its third-straight league crown, improving to 11-1 in conference play while handing Princeton a key third tally in the Ivy League loss column. If that happens, it would be tough for anyone to catch the Crimson in the Ivy standings. If they lose to Harvard this weekend, the Tigers would need to win out and hope the Crimson drops both of its final two conference games at Lavietes Pavilion, in which case they would also earn a share of the title--and force a playoff for the league's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
But if history is any indication, getting two wins on the road against the Killer P's is easier said than done. Although the Crimson is the favorite heading into both of this weekend's contests, Harvard hasn't won at Jadwin Gymnasium since Feb. 3, 1989--before anyone on the current Crimson roster was even born. And the last time Harvard swept this road trip was during the 1984-85 campaign. At this point, the Ivy League's automatic bid to the Big Dance--along with the Ancient Eight title--is still very much up in the air.

The History of Science department unveiled a revamped sophomore tutorial this semester featuring virtual interviews, student-driven lectures, and a chance for students to engage in independent research.Designed and taught by History of Science professor and department chair Anne Harrington, the class aims to challenge students by blurring the line between learning and teaching.Harrington’s project was funded by a grant from the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/18/hauser-teaching-learning-initiative-harvard-faust/"">Founded in 2011 by a $40 million gift from Rita E. and Gustave M. Hauser, the Initiative provides resources for faculty such as Harrington looking to develop new ways of pedagogy.To offer a more engaging and innovative learning experience, Harrington’s sophomore tutorial features original videotaped interviews as part of the weekly course material.The department hired six junior concentrators to conduct interviews with experts on the topics discussed in class, according to Daniel Z. Wilson ’14, one of the students chosen for the job.
“I think readings, especially in the humanities and in the social sciences, can feel sort of anonymous,” Wilson said.“It’s hard to put faces to the names and really have a feel for what it’s like for a scholar to do his work.”According to Nathan Greenslit, a teaching assistant in social studies who oversees the logistics of the interviewing process, the recordings will become a permanent component of the tutorial in future years.Greenslit said that history of science scholars have responded enthusiastically to the project.“Behind the theory or scholarship is a human being who is really excited by the material,” Greenslit said.In addition to the multimedia component, Harrington’s new tutorial divides the traditional lecture into sections and plenaries—sessions that consist of presentations led by student groups and discussions facilitated by Harrington.“I’m not expecting people to be teachers, I’m not expecting them to do my job,” Harrington said. “I’m inviting them to take ownership of their materials.”Finally, after the course concludes, students will have the opportunity to go on a two-week trip to conduct independent research through a grant program.“We envision it as an opportunity for sophomores to have the kind of experience that [is] normally reserved for juniors and seniors—which is to say, research,” said Christopher J. Phillips, a history of science lecturer who oversees the program with Harrington.Although the program is currently only funded for this year, Phillips and Harrington say they want the experience to become a permanent part of the tutorial.“Our hope is that this will become a model across the social sciences—that concentrations and programs can use it to really show how sophomores can be involved in an in-depth research project even in that early stage,” Phillips said.Enrollee Edwin L. Whitman ’15 put it another way: “[This model] should be replicated because it’s very much in line with what the college learning experience is about.”—Staff writer Francesca Annicchiarico can be reached at fannicchiarico01@college.harvard.edu.

In the first union rally to ever take place in Memorial Church, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers gathered with supporters on Thursday afternoon to bring attention to its ongoing contract negotiations.Harvard and HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty staff, have been in contract negotiations since the old contract between the two sides expired July 1 of last year.HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger estimated that 750 people were in attendance at Thursday’s rally. At the gathering, he called for partnership between HUCTW and the University, saying that while the two parties have had a strong relationship since the union’s conception 25 years ago, he believes recently the University has been less willing to compromise.“True partnership has to be a two-way street,” Jaeger said. “and it’s time for us to cross over to the sunny side of the street for a little while.”A University spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard remains committed to resolving the issues through the negotiation process.
“We have had positive and constructive discussions as part of the mediation process and will continue to work toward an agreement that is fair to employees represented by the HUCTW and to employees across the University as a whole,” the spokesperson wrote.Thursday’s rally featured a variety of speakers, a conscious decision intended to demonstrate the union’s broad base of support, Jaeger said.Jonathan L. Walton, minister of Memorial Church, wrote in an emailed statement that HUCTW members are “valuable and cherished members of the Harvard community.”He added, “If there is any location on this campus where persons should feel comfortable expressing and debating ideas, particularly those of a moral and ethical nature, I would hope it would be the Memorial Church.”For their part, speakers made a point of emphasizing their gratitude to Memorial Church for hosting the rally.The union also thanked the student groups in attendance and Harvard’s other unions, which were all represented at the rally, for their continued support.Jaeger said that the rally does not signal that the negotiations process is stalled. Instead, he said, it is an expression of the current sentiment within the union and among its supporters.“When there’s a whole community of people who have an urgent concern, it’s a healthy and constructive thing to come together and share ideas and learn from each other and express that concern,” Jaeger said.—Staff writer Christine Y.

The mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing of the students at Harvard and all of our patients has always been the top priority for Harvard University Health Services. We are continuously working with students and the entire Harvard community to improve the services we offer and increase the quality of care that we provide.Over the last decade, mental health has been a main focus for HUHS, administrative leaders, and students at the University. In 2000, the Provost’s Committee on Student Mental Health Services established a University-wide Student Health Coordinating Board to encourage collaboration, review standards and goals, and help educate the University community about available resources for students dealing with mental health issues. In 2004, a student mental health task force was created to examine the common and sometimes serious mental health problems faced by students. Undergraduate Council representatives and other students were members of both of these groups. These efforts resulted in the restructuring of our mental health and academic counseling areas to provide an overarching strategic view of these services for students at the University.The student mental health task force had several other recommendations for the University, many of which have already been implemented, such as the addition of wellness tutors in the Houses, focused specifically on emotional wellbeing. Since that time, HUHS has continued to improve the mental health resources available to students. Some of these efforts include hiring more full-time psychiatrists, increasing the number of visits for mental health treatment through the Student Health Insurance Plan from 12 to 24, and working with over 200 students in the peer counseling and peer education programs. Students, including UC representatives, currently serve on the College/HUHS committee, the Student Health Planning Committee, and the Student Patient Advocate Workgroup.Harvard has more full-time mental health staff than most other colleges. The national college average counselor to student ratio is 1:1600, and for private universities of our size it is 1:937. Harvard’s ratio is 1:750, not including the counselors at the Bureau of Study Counsel. The national college average of students seen for mental health concerns is 8.6 percent. In contrast, HUHS Student Mental Health Services cares for 15 percent of College students each semester.In the spring of 2012, we invited three national leaders in student mental health to conduct a comprehensive external review of SMHS. During their visit they met with students, SMHS staff, residential life staff, and College administrators.
They concluded: SMHS is a well-run clinic that maintains health-related confidentiality as a top priority. According to the reviewers, there is a perception that SMHS is not working solely for the administration, so it is not perceived by students, faculty, and staff as having a political agenda. Instead, they continued, the University community trusts that SMHS is there for the care of the students. The review also found that SMHS is well resourced relative to similarly sized institutions and to other Ivy League schools, especially if one includes the BSC’s licensed psychologists and social workers, and that SMHS provides comprehensive individual and group counseling services, which have above average utilization numbers. Many students reported that once they were in the system they felt that they received great care, though it could be hard to get an initial appointment. Students, faculty, and staff all praised SMHS crisis services, and agreed that students were always seen in an emergency.The external review helped us identify areas to focus on, and in response, SMHS initiated changes to improve access to first appointments for routine visits, and now has two full-time staff positions dedicated to access management and urgent care services. Anyone with an urgent need can usually be seen within 24 hours, and anyone with an emergency can be seen almost immediately.In addition to these areas that we are working to improve, HUHS already has many well-established services and is accustomed to dealing with the different medical and mental issues that students face. HUHS currently provides a wide range of support and treatment options; in addition to these services, we also offer group and peer counseling and assistance with finding outside providers.The mental health resources at HUHS are available to all students. All registered students are required to pay the Student Health Fee, which covers mental health and a wide range of other services at HUHS.Students are also automatically enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan, which covers prescription drugs and inpatient and outpatient services outside of HUHS. Students with their own, comparable health insurance may waive enrollment in the Student Health Insurance Plan. However, insurance provided by other carriers may not provide the same level of benefits or access to area providers. We encourage students to carefully review their health plan coverage before deciding to waive enrollment in the Student Health Insurance Plan. Detailed information about coverage and waiving the plan can be found on our website, <a href=""http://hushp.harvard.edu/"">hushp.harvard.edu.At HUHS our mission is to ensure that every student receives the care that he or she needs to succeed both personally and academically. As a community, we must work together to create an environment where this is possible through open communication. My door has always been open to discuss students’ concerns and suggestions for improving services, and I encourage students to contact their representatives on the various committees mentioned above or our Patient Advocate when they have concerns about our care.Paul J. Barreira, M.D., is the Director of Harvard University Health Services.

No one knew exactly when the martini glass first suction-cupped itself to the common room table. Or, for that matter, how so much mold started growing in a half-empty bottle of acidic Coke. But with Junior Parents Weekend only a week away and a roommate’s mom set to visit before then, Kelsey M. Muller ’14 said it became clear that both had to go.“We were like ‘Oh my God, we need to clean,’” Muller said. So she and a roommate spent last Friday night doing just that, working for several hours to purge, pitch, and organize months of accumulated trash. By the time they finished at midnight, in time to celebrate the roommate’s 21st birthday, the duo had filled roughly six bags of trash from their four-person suite in Mather. They even produced a top 10 list enumerating the grossest items they had uncovered.To varying degrees, juniors across the College have followed suit this week, hiding unwanted messes and unflattering alcohol containers in advance of their parents’ arrival.“It’s impeccable,” Muller said of the freshly cleaned common room. “Our shoes are all lined up neatly in a corner in a line.”“We’re not sure if we should dirty it a little before [our families] come because they might be suspicious that it is too clean,” Muller added.
For many, the annual weekend will be the first time their families have been back on campus since move-in day last fall. And though much of the weekend will be spent in uncomfortable togetherness at Boston hotels, dinners out, and House Master’s receptions, the unavoidable and much-dreaded room tour will set the tenor of the whole visit.“Usually we clean it pretty regularly, but you know how it gets with midterms week and extracurriculars,” said Madhavi V. S. V. Duvvuri ’14 of Adams House. Usually, she said, her family is understanding of a small mess, but on Parents Weekend, the stakes are higher.“This is a little bit different. All of our parents are coming, and I think that they expect that this is special and we will clean up for them,” she said.Ayo A. Matory ’14 said that while her room is relatively tidy, her dad “has very high standards.”While she always takes care to close drawers and hide any spare beverage bottles, Matory said that last time her father visited her Leverett single, not even scuffs on the floor evaded his eye.Others preparing for weekend drop-ins said that while their own parents might not mind a mess or the other trappings of collegiate life, they have chosen to clean out of deference to roommates’ parents who have different standards.“My dad appreciates a very clean room, but there’s just some stuff I have to put away,” said David R. Grieder ’14 of Eliot House.  “I have some trophies in my room that my dad would better appreciate not seeing, and my roommate’s parents would really appreciate not seeing.”—Staff writer Nicholas P.

“I agree with you, I want to do it, now make me do it,” Franklin D. Roosevelt told leftists during his presidency. As he understood, politicians respond to those who are best able to pressure them. And while climate activists can’t write out big checks in Manhattan and Houston, they can field whopping crowds on the National Mall—something they <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/feb/17/keystone-xl-pipeline-protest-dc"">proved last Saturday at a protest against the Keystone XL pipeline. The recent Keystone protests should motivate the president to take real action on climate change, which could quite reasonably be called the greatest and most pressing crisis of our generation. The Keystone XL pipelines would <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/k/keystone_pipeline/index.html"">bring oil extracted from the Alberta tar sands to the Gulf Coast for refinement and export. Climate activists see its construction as an existential threat to anti-global warming efforts. Many in the Great Plains are also concerned, for if ruptured, the pipeline could leak into the Ogallala Aquifer, the breadbasket region’s main source of water. Menaced by an end-of-days situation, climate activists, led by Bill E. McKibben ’82, a former Crimson president, and James E. Hansen, have rallied their energies, staging the biggest environmental protests seen since the movement’s 1970s heyday and the nation’s largest-ever climate change protest.  This brand of activism, drawing its participants from college campuses including our own, is just as necessary now as it was during the New Deal. During the 2008 presidential campaign, President Obama <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/us/politics/19climate.html"">pledged that by 2050 he would lower carbon emissions by 80 percent and invest $150 billion in green energy. But those promises never materialized. The president expended precious political capital on health care reform and an overhaul of financial regulation, making it easier for coal-state Democrats to kill cap-and-trade legislation. If anything, his first term saw a retreat on environmental issues, with the president <a href=""http://www.kansascity.com/2012/10/02/3844012/offshore-drilling-in-atlantic.html"">caving to the oil industry’s demands for more off-shore drilling and <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/02/news/economy/regulations/index.htm"">overruling the Environmental Protection Agency’s ozone directives.  These recent protests were seen as part of a craven political calculus, and thankfully they seem to have been only that. The high levels of participation from Harvard and other students are not only enormously inspiring, but they also point to the growing impatience of the American public with the president’s failure to take real action on the urgent problem of climate change and should create the political will for the federal government to do so. At his second inauguration, the president <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/obamas-second-inaugural-speech.html?pagewanted=all"">focused on the “the fierce urgency of now,” a theme into which climate action, cast as a moral and political imperative, figured significantly. But given Republican control of the House, chances of a congressional deal are nil.  Yet the president is not powerless. He has <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/obama-climate-change_n_2131419.html"">signaled a willingness to use executive orders to advance the environmentalist cause. Now, we have to make him do it.

A Shortage of Listening
Experiences with mental health difficulties are inherently, intensely personal. To make sweeping claims about mental health is very dangerous. There is a danger of isolating people on all sides of the discussion—those who work hard to provide care to our community can feel attacked by blanket criticism, and those who endure a very real struggle with mental health challenges can feel invalidated and uncared for.As a Student Mental Health Liaison, the privilege I have had of working with students and administrators has left me knowing quite confidently that there are by no means “serious” deficiencies with Harvard’s mental health services. I make such a strong claim not to undermine the voices of those who disagree with me, but because it is a reality that whenever we need it, and to whatever degree we need it, we have support available to us. There are 24-hour emergency services, all manner of counseling options, psychiatric treatments, caring tutors and proctors, peer counselors, peer educators and much more. It is essential that our discussion about mental health not leave members of our community reluctant to seek help or to suffer alone.Last week’s events showed us, however, that a lot of students feel like mental health services need improvement. Those feelings and opinions are, of course, valid. They are founded on real experiences and real concerns. There must, then, be some deficiencies—to me, those deficiencies are primarily in the listening and understanding in this dialogue.  Again, my experience tells me there is certainly a will to listen and understand. The “liaison” in Student Mental Health Liaisons exists to do this. Somewhere, voices have not been heard and concerns have not been understood. Students and the administration alike should listen actively and take each other’s concerns seriously. Only by understanding both sides can we come to understand the realities of the mental health experience at Harvard.Rishab Mehan ’14 is a social studies concentrator in Eliot House. He is a Student Mental Health Liaison and a former co-director of Room13. Mental Health: Awareness, Community, and ChangeAre there serious deficiencies with Harvard's mental health services? Absolutely.  Anyone who has sought help knows about the agonizing delays.  In frustration, many look outside the Harvard system for treatment and help, and even then they face weeks-long waiting lists.  These delays put lives at risk, and the University must make changes.  But while we push for change, we, the students, must find ways to help ourselves.Mental health awareness is one of the worst problems at the world’s best university.  Except when a tragedy occurs, mental health is never discussed in a positive manner.  These conversations are not easy, but the administration seems paralyzed by the difficulties involved with dispelling myths, providing access to support and treatment, and eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health issues.When we discovered that neither the Harvard Kennedy School nor the School of Public Health offered any classes on mental health initiatives, a group of concerned graduate students created a movement that we are calling the Harvard Students’ Mental Health Initiative.  At the same time, the College’s recent rally on mental health and ensuing dialogue ignited a vitally important campus dialogue.  As a unified student body, it is time to start working together to create change that meets our needs rather than waiting for the University to force a solution on us.Our initiative is open to every student—graduates and undergraduates alike.  We all know someone who needs our support.  The HSMHI seeks to initiate and develop innovative solutions for positive change and to create a network where we can rely on each other for fundamental support.  Together, we can insist on a positive, supportive, community-based approach that brings together supportive networks and pro-social connectedness to our student body.The time to act is now.  We hope you will join us.

Odd-number years are often painfully unsatisfying to devoted political junkies, the type that fervently read Nate Silver and make sure not to schedule any plans on Election Day. This off year, those interested can only turn to gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, in addition to the soporific qua Senate special election closer to home. Yet February was an unexpectedly uplifting month for fans of palace intrigue, and not just because of Netflix’s single-day release of “House of Cards.” Rather, world watchers have been provided the chance to witness the most interesting exercise in international politics—the selection of the successor to pontifex emeritus Benedict XVI.When Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation earlier this month, American liberal commentators began conjuring fatuous scenarios in which the Roman Catholic Church would quadrate with their progressive ideal of a crusader for social justice that is permissive of changing social norms. Former Crimson editor E.J. Dionne ’73 penned a provocative <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-best-choice-for-pope-a-nun/2013/02/15/83c8be2e-76c6-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story_1.html"">editorial calling on the College of Cardinals to forego two millennia of tradition and elect a nun. Others have chimerically proffered the suggestion of a Bishop of Rome in favor of same-sex marriage or abortion rights.Regardless of the merits of these liberal pipedreams, such fabulous thinking serves little purpose when it comes to prognosticating the next pope. This is because each of the papabili was appointed by either conservative Pope Benedict XVI or his conservative predecessor, John Paul II. As such, the papal statecraft of the upcoming weeks will not fall on the left-right spectrum familiar to modern American pundits. Rather, those with their eyes on the Catholic Church will witness an old-fashioned display of regional politics, with the majoritarian faction of the Italian old-guard pitted against the new world stewards of growing global Catholicism. If the cardinals are mindful of the issues guaranteed to plague the 286th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, they will select a papabile from outside of Europe’s boot.Italian cardinals are likely to make a strong play for the pontificate, which has been on a 35-year hiatus from Mediterranean control. The election of Polish John Paul II in 1978 put the first foreigner in the Vatican in 455 years, and recent reports of the inner workings of the world’s smallest nation suggest that the Italian delegation is itching again for control.Like in all countries, the responsibilities of the Vatican’s chief executive are geminate—the leader has to manage both domestic affairs and foreign policy. The latter might be especially important to the Holy See, insofar as the number of believers it maintains the world over is directly correlated with its legitimacy and moral authority. Unfortunately, the most recent papacy has succumbed to imbroglios in both realms, and it will be up to Benedict XVI’s replacement to right an increasingly tremulous ship. The next pope needs character such as that manifest in John Paul II, who was able to successfully toe the line between proselytism and diplomacy.
On the domestic side, Vatican City is currently in utter disarray. The shambolic condition of the apparently venal curia led Benedict’s butler, who was tried for stealing important papers from the desk of the pope, to <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9594192/Popes-butler-was-trying-to-protect-Benedict-XVI-from-wolves.html"">describe his former boss as “a pure man in the midst of wolves.” Documents have been unearthed demonstrating how officials have been <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/27/world/europe/archbishop-viganos-transfer-hints-at-vatican-power-struggle.html"">exiled for attempting to expose corruption within the city-state’s administration, and there is ongoing controversy surrounding the cozy <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9323288/Prosecutors-investigate-Vatican-Bank-mafia-link.html"">relationship between the Vatican Bank and the Italian Mafia. All of this has been humiliatingly augmented by rumors of a secret <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/world/europe/shadows-accompany-gathering-to-pick-pope.html?pagewanted=all"">dossier adumbrating claims of gay orgies and blackmail among high-ranking clergy. The Vatican has ascribed to the code of omertà in these instances, but even a grain of truth signifies the antithesis of good governance.While it is easy to blame the cerebral ex-pope for a failure in executive leadership, it is also important to consider the identity of the power brokers in the Holy See. The Italian lobby is by far the <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/International/pope-benedict-xvi-resignation-meet-papal-contenders/story?id=18466161"">largest interest group in the College of Cardinals, and their dominant position has reportedly been the source of pronounced infighting over which of them would eventually accede to the cathedra following Benedict’s departure. The election of any of them will inevitably lead to more internecine tumult, which is the last thing the Church needs as it continues to hemorrhage devoted followers.This is the other crucial issue the next pontiff must address. Western Europe is now rife with secularism, and many nominal Catholics have become shaky, if not completely lapsed, in their beliefs. It would be difficult for a pope to come from a nation where even his own congregation has doubts about his spiritual primacy. For this reason, those who can circumnavigate their own ambition long enough to think about the future of the Church should look toward the developing world, where faith is both strong and growing. The College of Cardinals is lucky to have a host of compelling candidates from Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. While it would be naïve to suggest that cardinals from outside of the Italian peninsula are immune to political maneuvering, there is no doubt that a cardinal change in the Vatican’s personnel could only lead to a more catholic and apostolic future for the Roman Catholic Church.John F.

It may seem paradoxical to use words to describe the experience of stripping words of their meaning. This is the premise behind “Uncanny Val- ley,” a multimedia spoken word perfor- mance that took place on Thursday at Paine Hall. Jon Woodward, author of the poem “Uncanny Valley,” was joined onstage by his wife, Oni Buchanan, who is a pianist, and accompanied by the music of composer John Gibson and a wide range of pre-recorded digital sounds. Words played only a supporting role in this intense and unusual performance, which was meant to shock like the car crash it describes.Woodward, who works as a curato rial assistant at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, is known for his eclectic poetic projects, which include a 40-foot-long poem written by typewriter on a single roll of paper. Buchanan, herself a poet, is a graduate of the New England School of Music and the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop. Gibson is a well-respected composer and has written pieces for a variety of ensembles.The event was a joint production of Harvard’s Woodberry Poetry Room and Ariel Artists, a classical music management organization that aims to connect talented artists with concert presenters and audiences appreciative of innovative music.Woodward said his poem had two influences: a nightmare that he had in which he may or may not have caused a car crash that killed innocent people, and the phrase “uncanny valley.” This expression, coined in 1970 by roboticist Masahiro Mori, describes the drop in empathy that humans have when interacting with robots that look and act increasingly human.To toy with this idea, Woodward said illogical statements and inverted and repeated them until they lost all meaning. Phrases such as, “What thoughts wreck thoughts / Could I rubberneck those?” were collapsed and ran together like bumper cars. Rather than narrate the story linearly, Woodward wanted to make the audience undergo their own dizzying experience with a distorted reality.
The performance consisted of 16 poetic components, read through continuously. The more the words were repeated and sustained, the faster their meaning slipped away. This phenomenon is known as “semantic satiation.” In this common psychological experience, a word that is repeated loses all meaning and becomes nothing more than sound.Since he was reading his own poem, Woodward was at liberty to repeat words and whole phrases as much as he wanted. “I might repeat this from 0 to 225 times,” he said at the beginning, half in jest. Woodward has delivered the work 10 times, altering it each performance, since the work debuted at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in September 2012.Woodward commissioned Gibson to compose an original concert-length score to accompany his words, although the piece does not deliberately illustrate the poem. “I wanted there to be enough variety of sounds to sustain the audience for the full hour,” Woodward says.The combination of meaning- less words, piano music, and digital sound—all playing at once—was overwhelming.According to Woodward, the rhythmic pace of the performance was intended to make it difficult to process and rationalize. Buchanan’s jazzy play- ing ran over the words with anxious trills, eerie chords, and loud bangs, recreating the drama of a car crash. To traverse the range of human and robotic noises, Buchanan moved while at the piano, plucking and scratching its strings, playing up and down in dynamics. In contrast, Woodward delivered his equally jarring sentences in a calm and soft-spoken voice.As divergent and free-spirited as their individual performances might have seemed, they were closely synchronized with Gibson’s digital soundtrack—composed of mashed-up recordings of robots, music by com- poser Robert Schumann, and Wood- ward’s own poetry—which Woodward controlled from his laptop. The words and music at once amplified each other and clashed, creating a sonic house of mirrors.The structure of the performance encouraged audience members to linger over what Woodward calls the“visible fissile ribbons” of the poem’s language. Yet, the performance left no time for reflection. It combined several common elements—poetry, electronic and live music, and a commonly ob- served psychological phenomenon—to produce an original and disconcerting artistic experience.—Staff writer Katya Johns can be reached at kjohns@college.harvard.edu.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarification:CORRECTION: March 21, 2013An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that composer John Gibson is Irish.CLARIFICATION: March 24, 2013An earlier version of this article stated that classical musician managing organization Ariel Artists connects virtuosic pianists with visionary composers. To clarify, the group aims to bring together artists with concert presenters and audiences appreciative of innovative music.

Scene Recital by the Hyperion Shakespeare CompanyMarch 1-2, 8 p.m.Adams Pool TheatreDirected by Olivia L Ball ’14, Matthew B. Barrieau ’16, Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16, Emilie G.C. Thompson ’16Produced by Alice F. Berenson ’16, Bethany L. Donovan ’16. 
At 8 p.m. on Friday in Adams Pool Theatre, Hyperion Shakespeare Company will present a series of student-directed scenes, each from a different Shakespeare play. This year, the theme of the scene recital is dysfunctional families. “We [got] to pick scenes that we’re really excited about…that we want to dive into and have fun with,” director and actress Olivia L. Ball ’14 says. The aptly titled “Family Feud” will play through Saturday.Hyperion is a student-led acting group on campus dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to act, direct, and share a love of Shakespeare. Each semester, members of the Hyperion company’s board, called The Bench, select a theme for a scene recital and then choose segments from different plays which relate to that theme. This year, the plays include “Hamlet,” “King Lear,” “The Comedy of Errors,” “Coriolanus,” “Measure for Measure,” “Richard III,” and “As You Like It.”“Family Feud” is a more digestible dose of Shakespeare because the short snippets are distillations of the members’ favorite Shakespearean moments. It is different from most other plays on campus in that “Family Feud” does not have one plot; the production is a medley of bite-sized pieces brought to life by the enthusiasm of its directors and actors. Each member of the Company brings a professed love of Shakespeare to their scenes.“They get all of my nerdy Shakespeare jokes,” Ball says. “I’m directing a scene from Hamlet that I love, so it’s been really fun to see that come to life.”—Staff writer Nzuekoh N.

Recent <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/28/fall-of-harvard-academics/"">discussions have detailed all too well how undergraduate education has failed. For too many, it has become a means to an end. Easy courses provide the means for a good grade. The right course titles will help in recruiting. Classes, and the work that they entail, have lost their value amidst the benefits that prestige may entail.But there are still those of us who care about our education, the ones who take courses on the basis of personal interest. Many of us understand the opportunities provided here and the value of each class for our personal education.There’s a problem, though. Most of us are miserable.We face a relentless grind of midterms and papers. We intentionally place ourselves in a position of sleep deprivation. And we even compete with others about who has the worst workload at any given time.Our culture has received a lot of needed attention recently, from inadequate mental health services to the inherent competition created by over 6,000 of the most ambitious and gifted students in the country. But the academic environment has failed to enter these discussions.
Both Harvard and Oxford draw similar students, place the same high bars for admission, and impose similar workloads. Logically, students should share similar experiences at both schools. Yet their experiences, on average, are completely different. And it stems from the academic environment.Sure, Oxford students are stressed during final exams and other important points of their course, but they never endure the same weariness that pervades our campus. And there are never discussions about the Oxford system as a failure.Oxford courses occur as individualized tutorials. Each week, the professor provides a reading list for a particular topic. The student then reads the sources and writes a paper typically between 2,000 and 3,000 words long. The student then meets the tutor, discusses the paper, and repeats the cycle for every week throughout the term.The system is impractical, inefficient, and can sometimes feel outdated. But it also emphasizes the deeply individual nature of learning. Students bear the responsibility for every reading and every topic. They have complete control over their education.And at its core, education remains a fundamentally personal experience. While discussions and evaluations are a necessary part of academic life, learning is a process that occurs internally. Tutorials, for all of their practical disadvantages, provide a nearly ideal means to structure and pursue that experience.Harvard classes have lost that individual component. Even our smallest courses involve a performative aspect during seminar discussions. No matter our motivation for taking a particular course, whether personal interest or concentration requirement, we all must demonstrate our knowledge in some way to both teaching fellows and peers.That element of our education comes through most clearly, though, during sections. Participation grades have transformed these discussions from a stage of collaboration into a stage of competition. The vast majority of students speak for the grade and not the material. And that is why we hate section. It has destroyed the purpose of itself.Furthermore, these aspects of our education occur in the context of a failed academic culture. When many students only care about the grade and many professors do not care about the teaching, those who care about the material are left on their own. The will to learn erodes under the need to compete. Academic inquiry erodes in the face of apathy.We desire to learn, but in this academic desert, courses lose their intrinsic value. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the spirit of inquiry against an environment that reduces learning to a means for a good grade or a successful career.Our culture needs to change. But it will be a slow and arduous process. In the meantime, all we can do is evaluate our intentions and ourselves. The irony of our current culture is that, in a way, it actually enhances the personal nature of education.Isolated from the other students by our motivations and our professors by our priorities, we are left alone, both with our thoughts and the others who commiserate with us. And it is in these contexts that we truly learn.This is the last bastion of education at Harvard. It occurs in our readings, not our lectures. It occurs in our conversations, not our sections. It occurs in the late night common room discussions and dining hall debates. But mostly it occurs alone, late at night, as you block out everything around you and silently continue to think.Raul Quintana ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Leverett House.

The Allston neighborhood is the newest hub of authentic Swiss treats.After months of community <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/9/22/allston-residents-harvard-bakery/"">anticipation, Swiss Bakers, a family-owned bakery and café, celebrated its grand opening during a packed ceremony Thursday night.The café represents the newest small business Harvard has brought in to revitalize Barry’s Corner, the area surrounding the intersection of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street in North Allston.The grand opening drew as many as a thousand people over the span of the evening. Prize baskets were raffled off, and the conversation paused every 10 minutes as the drone of a 10-foot alpenhorn—a traditional Swiss instrument played by a man in traditional Swiss dress—boomed through the crowded café.Throughout the evening, a staff of co-entrepreneurs—Swiss Bakers does not use the term ‘employee’—offered heaping platters of baked croissants, rolls, and sweets to the guests—who in turn are not called customers.
“We’re all about food-loving and guest-hugging,” said Thomas Stohr, who owns the bakery with his wife Helene.From the iconic red cow symbolizing Switzerland on the roof of the building to the designated guest-greeter at the door, Stohr said that his priority is to convey Swiss culture to the public.“Everything you get from us is Swiss,” Stohr said. “We want people to say, ‘I just visited Switzerland without leaving Massachusetts.’”Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that he believes Swiss Bakers will “contribute to the vibrancy of <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/10/5/residents-allston-barrys-harvard/"">Barry’s Corner.”Two years ago, Harvard approached Swiss Bakers about the possibility of the bakery renting the Western Avenue location. The new site is 14,000 square feet, 35 times larger than the company’s flagship location in the Reading train station. To date, Harvard has worked to lease 900,000 square feet of space in Allston to commercial tenants, according to Lisa Hogarty, Harvard’s vice president of campus services.Hogarty also said that the new Swiss Bakers—which is located in what was once a Volkswagen dealership—along with the recently opened <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/27/allston-hearth-pizza-company/"">Stone Hearth Pizza Co. represent an attempt by the University to bring pedestrian, rather than automotive, traffic to Barry’s Corner.Allston Civic Association President Paul Berkeley said that he was looking forward to seeing a diverse array of new businesses open in the area.In addition to serving the North Allston community, Swiss Bakers food will also stretch across the river to the College campus. According to Hogarty, Crimson Catering will begin to incorporate Swiss Bakers products into its menu.“Look for it in a dining hall near you,” she said.—Staff writer Marco Barber Grossi can be reached at mbarbergrossi@college.harvard.edu.

PHILADELPHIA—The Harvard men’s basketball team left Cambridge on Thursday as a heavy favorite to three-peat as Ivy League champion, boasting a 1.5-game lead over Princeton in the conference standings.The Crimson returns to Cambridge needing a prayer to extend its season.Following Friday night’s loss at Princeton, Harvard couldn’t keep up with Penn, falling, 75-72, at the Palestra.The Quakers’ relentless defensive pressure stalled Harvard’s offense in the opening frame, as the Crimson was held to 26.1 percent shooting and went into halftime trailing, 38-26.Harvard found an offensive rhythm in the second frame, but the Crimson was unable to pull even with the Quakers (8-20, 5-6 Ivy), who grabbed timely offensive rebounds and hit eight of 12 free throws in the final two minutes.
“We got [the win] because we are a relatively young team and the effort and intensity and attention to detail on the defensive end tonight was fantastic,” said Penn coach Jerome Allen, whose team forced 16 turnovers and held the Crimson to 40.4 percent shooting on the night.Despite trailing throughout the second half, the Crimson had a chance to send the game into overtime at the buzzer. With 2.4 seconds remaining, sophomore Jonah Travis sent a full-court pass to classmate Wesley Saunders, who tapped it out to co-captain Christian Webster on the perimeter. But Webster’s attempt fell short, and the Crimson walked off the court with its Ivy title hopes greatly diminished.Coupled with the Tigers’ victory over Dartmouth on Saturday night, Harvard (17-9, 9-3) now trails by a game in the loss column with two contests remaining.For the Crimson to extend its season, Harvard will need to sweep next weekend’s contests against Cornell and Columbia, and the Tigers (19-9, 9-2) will need to drop one of their three remaining road contests at Brown, Yale, or Penn.“As I mentioned to our kids, we have seen a lot of interesting things happen in our league already,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We have two games to play, and we are going home. No matter what happened here [Saturday night] or [Friday] night, it’s the same: We are going home to finish out our regular-season schedule.”The Quakers received stellar performances from two of its rookies—freshmen Tony Hicks and Darien Nelson-Henry—who combined for 42 points, 15 rebounds, and six steals.Coming off a 23-point effort in the Quakers’ 69-64 loss to Dartmouth on Friday night, Hicks continued to fill the basket on Saturday. The guard posted a game-high 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting and added five assists and three steals.“I thought he was the difference,” Amaker said.In the post, the Crimson couldn’t find an answer for the 6’11” Nelson-Henry who posted a double-double with 18 points (8-of-13 shooting) and 11 rebounds.Harvard center Kenyatta Smith—whose near triple-double was critical to the Crimson’s victory over the Quakers earlier this season—was neutralized on the offensive end, posting seven points on just two-of-seven shooting.

PRINCETON, N.J.—After a layup by sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi brought the score to a tie for the first time on Friday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team had a chance to break its 24-year losing streak at Jadwin Gymnasium.And after senior forward Ian Hummer and Moundou-Missi traded free throws, Moundou-Missi came down with a rebound and drew the foul on the other end, converting the three-point play and giving the Crimson its first lead of the night.But the Tigers (16-9, 9-2 Ivy) would not go down without a fight, and fouls down the stretch doomed Harvard (17-9, 9-3) to another road loss, 58-53, tying the two teams in the defeat column.“Our focus was to see if we could play well enough to come here and win, and we came close again,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The big stat for me is just five assists for us as a team and the rebounding margin that they put up. It’s not a big mystery that we came up short after that.”After junior forward Will Barrett went to the line and hit two with 2:30 left to play, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers—looking to find senior guard Christian Webster—threw the ball away on a long cross-court pass, and a Hummer put-back handed Princeton a one-point lead.
Following the next timeout, Chambers rolled in a reverse layup to put the Crimson up again, 53-52. After Hummer knocked down two more free throws—part of a 7-for-7 effort from the stripe on the night—the Moundou-Missi missed a layup on the other end and failed to convert off his offensive board, handing the ball back to the Tigers.Harvard would not score again, as Moundou-Missi grabbed the ball after a Crimson miss but came down out of bounds in the ensuing scramble, resulting in a turnover. The Tigers added their final six points from the charity stripe.Down by three with 2.7 seconds to play, sophomore forward Jonah Travis inbounded the ball as the Crimson looked to tie the game. But the pass was knocked away by Hummer into Tigers guard TJ Bray’s hands, and he was fouled by junior co-captain Laurent Rivard—his fifth of the night—and made two free throws, securing the Tigers’ win.“Certainly a tough loss for us,” Amaker said. “Both teams really gave incredible effort.... We were not very good offensively or efficiently, making shots and doing what we normally do. That was because of how hard they play and how tough they played [Friday night].”In the first half, Princeton jumped out to a quick lead after Harvard failed to score on its first four possessions, but sophomore Wesley Saunders put the Crimson on the board with a short jumper two minutes in.The Tigers opened up an eight-point lead—their biggest of the half—after five minutes. Princeton relied on a strong half-court press to limit the Crimson to 28.6 percent shooting in the first half and finished the period up by six.“All week in practice we just focused on closing out on the guys,” Bray said. “Rivard got fouled on two threes, but we did a good job in making sure nobody got a lead.”Princeton continued its hot streak in the second half, going up by 10 when senior forward Mack Darrow hit the first three of the night after Hummer came down with an offensive board. Hummer led the Tigers with 23 points and 14 rebounds, including nine in the first half, and jumped into second place on Princeton’s all-time scoring list.“It means nothing if we didn’t get the win,” Hummer said. “It’s icing on the cake. First and foremost, we are competing for an Ivy League playoff, and we came to win.”Bray’s three—the only shot made from deep on the night—came halfway through the second period. The Crimson went 0-for-8 from behind the arc, with half of its shots coming from Webster.Coming off the bench with 31 minutes of playing time, Moundou-Missi led Harvard with 15 points and eight rebounds. The sophomore relied on efficient shooting, going 7-for-7 from the line and 4-for-6 from the field.Saunders added 11 points—but only four in the second half—and Chambers chipped in 10. The Crimson was out-rebounded, 37-24.“I thought Saunders did a decent job,” Amaker said. “His shooting percentage was low, but we need other guys to step forward. Saunders and Chambers, they are our playmakers and the focus of the other team’s scouting report.”—Staff writer Hope Schwartz can be reached at hschwartz@college.harvard.edu.

PRINCETON, N.J.—Princeton senior Ian Hummer sat for just three minutes in Friday night’s contest against Harvard.“[What] else can you say about the kid?” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said about Hummer. “He made every big play down the stretch for that team, whether it was a tip-in, free throws, intercepting the last pass, whatever he had to do. He was a monster.”On the defensive end, Hummer’s main assignment was Harvard co-captain Christian Webster, who was held scoreless for only the second time this season. Hummer finished with numbers above his season averages, scoring 23 points and grabbing 14 rebounds.With the night’s performance, Hummer moved into second all-time on the Tigers’ scoring charts—a feat that he says would not have mattered to him if Princeton had lost the game. The only Princeton player currently ahead of him is William Bradley, who ended his Tiger career with 2,503 points 48 years ago.“[It’s] fun to watch him play,” Princeton coach Mitch Henderson said. “I’m proud that he wears the orange and black. He does everything for us. He’s really worked hard, especially at free throw shooting. He’s constantly improving.”
EARNING HIS [CHARITY] STRIPESThree possessions after a long-distance shot extended Princeton’s lead to a game-high 10 points, the Tigers squad did exactly what almost any other team does when sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi receives a pass on the low block. They intentionally fouled him, choosing to give the traditionally shaky free-throw shooter a chance to prove himself at the line rather than score two easy-points. Mondou-Missi, who shoots just 66.7 percent from the charity stripe on the season, sunk each shot, avoiding the rim for a perfect swish on each.After he grabbed three consecutive defensive rebounds and put in a layup at the 7:29 mark of the second period, Moundou-Missi caught the ball at the left elbow, hesitated, took several dribbles to reach the baseline, and splashed in a short-corner baby-hook. The game, for the first time since the opening tip, was tied with 4:02 remaining.A number of Moundou-Missi’s openings were made possible by his screen-and-roll play with freshman Siyani Chambers, which Amaker said the two ran well late in the game.“[The pick-and-rolls] pushed us and got us in the lead” Amaker added.After Hummer made two free throws on the other end to regain the Princeton advantage, Mondou-Missi did his best impression of the Tiger senior as he sank both of his ensuing free throw attempts. And, after Tigers senior center Brendan Connolly missed a jumper on one side of the court, Moundou-Missi received the ball once again at the left short-corner position, drove hard to the basket, and knocked in the layup while drawing a foul. With the score and the foul shot, his seventh free throw of the day, the Crimson gained a three-point lead—its first advantage on the night.While turnovers would go on to doom Harvard’s chances to win the contest, Mondou-Missi finished the game with team-highs in points, 15, and rebounds, eight.“Steve did a terrific job,” Amaker said. “[With] his numbers, being seven-for-seven from the foul line, and [leading] us in rebounds…We are having him to do a heck of a lot there.”THREES [DRAW] A CROWDIn a contest billed as a matchup between two sharp-shooting three-point teams who average a combined 39.15 percent from beyond the arc, misses were abundant, closeouts were consistent, and swishes were close to nil on Friday night. Harvard and Princeton, who lead the Ivy League in three-point percentage, went a combined 1-for-18 from downtown, forcing the already-close contest to be played close to the basket.When the squads last faced off, the Crimson shot treys at a clip of 38.9 percent. On Friday, after a poor shooting first half, a shot from deep with seconds remaining on the clock was ironically exactly what Harvard needed to extend the game into overtime. But an interception prevented any last-chance attempt, and the contest was officially marked as the first of the season in which Harvard did not make a single three-pointer.As the scouting reports on both teams coming into the game emphasized long-range shooting, each side’s defensive scheme relied heavily on closing-out around the arc, increasing the difficulty of each attempt.Perhaps as a result of the augmented pressure outside, a majority of the Tigers’ offense was shifted inside, and the squad attempted 19 layups for the game—seven more than the Crimson put up. While Harvard made a total of nine lay-ins, Princeton converted on 12—a difference of six points in a game with a final spread of only five.The only made three of the night was one converted by 6’9” Tiger senior Mack Darrow at the 9:57 mark of the second period. With the shot, Princeton continued its streak of making at least one three-pointer in every game since the three-point line was brought to collegiate play.—Staff writer Juliet Spies-Gans can be reached at jspiesgans@college.harvard.edu.

PHILADELPHIA—Heading into its key Ivy matchup Saturday night against Penn, the Harvard men’s basketball team was in possession of the largest winning streak at the Palestra of any Ivy team.But for the first time in four years, the Quakers (8-20, 5-6 Ivy) emerged from their home contest against the Crimson (17-9, 9-3) on top, 75-72, narrowly avoiding being swept on the weekend at home and handing Harvard its second loss in as many days.“Congratulate Penn on a terrific effort,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The opening of the game and their intensity and defensive pressure was terrific, and I’m sure [Quakers’ coach Jerome Allen] is really excited and proud of his kids.”The last time the Crimson dropped both of its games at the Killer P’s was during the 2007-08 campaign—a season in which Harvard tallied just three wins in league play.But though the contest closed out an especially tough weekend for the Crimson—Harvard lost to Princeton by a slim margin Friday night—it was not the first time in recent memory that Penn spoiled a Crimson streak. In the two teams’ contest at Lavietes Pavilion last season, Penn walked away with a one-point victory, ending what was then the second-longest home winning streak in the country (27 games).
THREES COMPANYAfter going 0 of 8 from deep against Princeton, the Crimson—a team that averaged a .401 three-point percentage entering the weekend—appeared to be destined for another ineffective night from beyond the arc.“Our numbers have not been what we need them to be to win the last few games,” Amaker said.In the first half of its contest against the Quakers, Harvard made just two of its 10 attempts from three, as co-captain Christian Webster knocked down a pair of shots with 15:18 and 9:44 remaining in the half, respectively.But in the second frame, clutch three-pointers were largely responsible for keeping the Crimson in the game. Co-captain Laurent Rivard, who was kept off the scoreboard in the first despite attempting four shots from deep, made four three-pointers in the final 9:39, including a bomb from NBA range that narrowed the score to four with 1:38 left to play.Webster added three more treys in the second half on the way to a 5-for-10 effort, as the co-captains combined for 30 points on the night.Chambers also contributed a make from deep in the waning minutes of the contest, as the Crimson shot an impressive 72.7 percent from long range while also contributing a 13-for-24 (54.2 percent) effort from the field in the period.But despite increased shooting prowess in the latter frame of Saturday evening’s contest, Webster’s final attempt from three—a rushed shot from the corner in the final seconds of play that would have sent the game into overtime—missed the basket entirely, and the Crimson ended up suffering its second defeat of the weekend.NOBODY FRESH-ERWhile Harvard’s eldest players—Webster and Rivard—led a late offensive surge that nearly evened the contest, consistent play from two Penn freshman helped secure a win for the home team.

The Bobcats (24-5-5, 17-2-3 ECAC) were undefeated  in 18 games after leading after two periods (16-0-2) and had not dropped an ECAC contest since October.That all changed off a tip from Alex Fallstrom.The senior forward’s overtime goal with 18.6 seconds left in the extra frame lifted Harvard to a 2-1 upset at the Bright Hockey Center Friday evening. In its penultimate game of the season, the last-place Crimson (9-17-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) found a way to knock off a top-ranked team for the first time since 2004.“We’ve been facing a lot of adversity. We haven’t been winning as much as we’d like [with] a lot of injuries,” Fallstrom said. “But the one thing that’s really cool is that we never stop believing in ourselves. We just kept working, came down to the rink every day, battling, and today that pays off, so it feels really good.”With less than 30 seconds left in overtime, it appeared that Harvard would leave the ice with a moral victory. For the Crimson, which entered the game poised to become the first squad in program history to finish at the bottom of the ECAC, a 1-1 tie against the No. 1 team in the county wouldn’t have been too shabby.
But Greg Gozzo had other plans. The freshman forward forced a turnover at the Quinnipiac blueline knocking the puck onto the stick of classmate Jimmy Vesey. With just under 20 ticks left, Vesey connected with Fallstrom on a tape-to-tape, backdoor feed for the game winner.“Vesey made a beautiful pass to Fallstrom, and I think the unsung hero there was Gozzo,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Our guys, they battled to the last second, and I’m happy for the guys because we’ve worked real hard. We’ve been close to making some plays at key times in the game, and tonight we were able to make them.”After a scoreless opening frame, Bobcat senior foreward Ben Arnt emerged from a scramble in front of the net to push a rebound past junior Harvard goaltender Raphael Girard with just over five minutes left in the second period. Quinnipiac continued to challenge Girard, who finished the night with 33 saves, in the final minutes of the second frame but settled for a 1-0 lead after 40 minutes.The tide turned in the third period as the Crimson outshot the Bobcats, 12-5, in the final frame of regulation. Quinnipiac had outshot Harvard, 26-18, in the first two frames.Less than six minutes into the third, senior forward Marshall Everson found freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo open along the left wing. The freshman forward threatened a cross-ice pass to classmate Brian Hart before launching a wrister from within the faceoff circle. The shot sailed past the glove Quinnipiac goaltender Eric Hartzell (33 saves) for Criscuolo’s sixth of the season and third in the last two games.“I knew that [Hartzell] would be thinking I might pass it, so I pulled the puck back, made sure that he knew that I would have the opportunity to pass it if I wanted to, and went short-side,” Criscuolo said.The final minutes saw close calls on both sides. Hartzell poke-checked away a point-blank attempt by Criscuolo midway through the third. In overtime, Girard was forced to make a couple of close leg saves to keep the Crimson in the game. Fallstrom provided the highlight of the night with his seventh goal of the season.Quinnipiac entered Saturday’s game with a 12-point lead in the ECAC standings and a first-place conference tournament seed locked up. But Bobcats coach Rand Pecknold felt that his team’s comfortable position in the rankings did not affect its play.“Our guys, they played hard tonight,” Pecknold said. “I don’t think it’s a motivational thing; I think our guys competed their tails off tonight. We just didn’t play smart. We made a lot of small, little mistakes, and we’ve got to clean up some errors.”The Crimson had last defeated a team ranked No.1 in a 3-1 home win over Boston College on Nov. 17, 2004. Quinnipiac’s last in-conference loss was a 5-1 defeat to Colgate on Oct. 27 at a neutral rink in Hyannis, Mass.After an eight-game losing streak consumed most of January and the beginning of February, the Crimson has posted a 4-1-2 record in its last seven games.  Harvard’s chronically depleted roster has recently shown flashes of the squad that made a run to last year’s ECAC final, gaining strength and confidence along the way.“After the BU game, the seniors really stepped up, and I think they’ve really been leading the way as of late,” Criscuolo said. “It continues to boost our confidence going into the playoffs.”“You could argue that there wasn’t a lot to gain from the standings perspective, but I think there is a lot of pride in our locker room,” Donato added.The overtime win allowed the Crimson to draw within a point of 11-th place Colgate.—Staff writer Michael D.

With a 33-game Ivy League winning streak on the line and down by one with 2:11 remaining, Princeton guard Niveen Rasheed stepped up to the free-throw line. After going 7-of-8 from the charity stripe on the day, Rasheed tossed up the first, which clanked off the backboard. Her second attempt rimmed in and—just like many Tigers’ attempts Friday night—rimmed out.Although a well-placed inbounds pass allowed Princeton to cut the lead to one with 22 seconds remaining, a clutch performance by senior forward Victoria Lippert and a strong defensive stand ensured that the Tigers wouldn’t find its 34th straight win on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion.Behind Lippert, who has now put up double figures in each of her last seven games, the Harvard women’s basketball team (16-8, 7-3 Ivy) withstood a late Princeton surge to remain undefeated at home and beat the Tigers (18-6, 9-1) for the first time in over two years, 58-55.“I think that throughout the year, we’ve been in a lot of close games,” junior guard Christine Clark said. “That actually played to our favor tonight because we’ve been in this situation before, so we knew that we could pull out the win. I think we had them running scared a little bit.”After coming out of the half with a four-point lead over Princeton—a situation that the Tigers haven’t found themselves in during Ivy League play since its 2011 matchup against the Crimson—coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was cautious of becoming too confident too quickly against a dangerous Princeton team.
“We’ve had an early 12-point lead on them down at Princeton,” Delaney-Smith said. “That doesn’t even bother them. They have kids that catch and shoot threes and hit big shots, they have great rebounding in Niveen and others, and they are really, really good in the open court.”Neither team seemed to be able to find any offensive momentum to begin the second half until sophomore guard Ali Curtis netted the first bucket of the half on either side, a triple, after over four minutes had elapsed. In the first 10 minutes of the half, eight of the Tigers’ 10 points came from behind the charity stripe, a sign of Harvard’s early foul trouble.“I think we should have gotten to the line,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re a very physical team, I think we have to do a better job of getting ourselves to the line… In the second half, their offense wasn’t doing anything. It was the free-throw line and rebounds.”The Crimson built a lead as big as seven in the second half with 9:45 remaining, but then the Princeton offense came to life. Fueled by a flurry of offensive rebounds, the Tigers went on a 7-2 run to tie the game for the first time. The teams traded buckets until junior guard Missy Mullins fouled Rasheed as she pulled down her fifth offensive rebound of the game. With Harvard over the limit, the senior went to the line and knocked both down, giving Princeton its first lead since 14:25 in the first half.“They are a very good offensive team, and I really do think that Niveen is the motor behind it,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re a very good rebounding team, and Niveen is probably the best rebounder in the league, in every regard. Her second, third, fourth jumps are so quick, so athletic, so when all else fails, she went to town in rebounds.”But the Crimson had an answer to every run by the Tigers, and Lippert, the Ivy League’s top free-throw shooter, sunk four in succession to give Harvard the lead with 20 seconds left. Princeton inbounded and missed two treys in a row before the buzzer rang.“She has done that all four years,” Delaney-Smith said. “She is and always has been ice.”Although Harvard only converted 37.5 percent of its field goals, the Crimson held the Tigers to just 25.8 percent shooting, its lowest of the season. Even while out-rebounding Harvard 47-39, Princeton had tough looks all night and only converted on 16 of 62 attempts.“We were really wanting to focus on transition defense for this game, because we know that’s where they primarily like to score in their offense,” Lippert said. “They’re not as comfortable in half-court sets.”Rasheed led the Tigers’ offensive campaign with her 12th double-double of the year, tallying 13 points and 11 boards, while Lippert led the Crimson with 21. Clark also joined the senior in double figures, racking up 14 points.—Staff writer Samantha Lin can be reached at samanthalin@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter @linsamnity.

Issa Rae is the creator of the beloved and critically acclaimed YouTube Series ""<a href=""http://www.issarae.com/awkward-black-girl/"">The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,"" in which she stars as J, a hilariously honest—and, yes, awkward—young woman dealing with the trials and tribulations of everyday life. On campus this weekend for a conference at Harvard Law School, she chatted with Flyby about the importance of embracing the awkward, from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIVa9lxkbus"">stop signs to higher education.<!--more-->Flyby: How much of J's experiences [on the show] come from your own personal experience?Issa Rae: A lot of J's experiences haven't happened to me except the poor awkward moments like the stop sign… all the awkward moments have happened to at some point in my life. But her life is not my life. She handles things in a way that I wouldn't.Flyby: Do you think you're similar to J?
IR: Yeah… I'm nicer than she is. She has the worst thoughts in life, but she's an extension of me. She thinks things that sometimes I think, but out loud. She's 30 to 40 percent me, it varies. It depends on the day. Flyby: What's the most awkward thing that's ever happened to you?IR: It's everyday in life. I think sixth grade defines my awkwardness. We moved from Maryland to LA, and in Maryland I had all these interracial friends and we were all black girls and I was used to that. Then I moved to a predominantly black neighborhood in LA, and they hated me because I wore my hair naturally and I had this weird sense of humour to them, and I was just super goofy. Everything I did was like, ""I want to be black, too! I'm black, guys!"" Looking back on it, it's very embarrassing. Flyby: There are a lot of awkward people at Harvard. Do you have any advice for them?IR: I would say embrace it. At Stanford there were definitely like, hella awkward people but if you just embrace it and know who you are… the worst thing you can do is try to hide it. I would say get comfortable with your awkwardness. Flyby: Why do you think Awkward Black Girl has been so popular? What do you think it takes to make a YouTube video go viral?IR: I think it was good timing. I think specifically because there's a lead female of color, and at the time on television there wasn't. She's relatable, she goes through things that everybody goes through; everybody's been uncomfortable, everybody's been awkward at some point. I think that's the reason it's become so popular. I think to go viral you have to tap into something that's universal and that people can look at and go, ""That's so me!"" or, ""That's so my friend!"" People want to see themselves depicted in the characters. Or it has to be a cat video.

At first glance, “Jack the Giant Slayer” appears to be yet another blockbuster reimagining of a fairy tale, the product of Hollywood’s recent obsession with adapting children’s stories and adding an adult twist. From January’s “Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters” to last summer’s “Snow White and the Huntsman,” fairy tale adaptations have proved disappointing for the most part. The general formula of combining attractive stars with “grit” does not guarantee successful films, or even enjoyable ones. But “Jack the Giant Slayer” knows that it is a fairy tale, and this self-awareness saves it from many of the same pitfalls. Director Bryan Singer, best known for “The Usual Suspects” and several of the X-Men films, places a strong emphasis on impressive visuals and stunning special effects. At the film’s opening, we’re treated to a faithfully executed medieval setting with lavish costumes and sets. However, our later foray into the land of the giants reveals a truly extraordinary world, more expansive and colorful than our five-year-old imaginations could ever have conceived. The film is shot in 3D, which serves to accentuate specific visuals such as the beanstalk, a massive and intimidating being that seems capable of independent thought and action. Out to conquer this beanstalk is dashing farm boy Jack (Nicholas Hoult, 10 years after his work in “About a Boy”). In an opening true to the original fairy tale, Jack misguidedly trades his family’s horse to a monk for a sack of beans. The twist, thankfully not gritty, is that while he is in the market, Jack encounters Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), the princess of the kingdom of Cloister. Set to marry a man she doesn’t love, Isabelle is finally rebelling against the insularity and restrictiveness of her life. One plot contrivance later, and the two finally interact—until one of the aforementioned beans erupts into a beanstalk that carries the princess away to the land of giants, towards the sort of adventure she’s been seeking. Although Hoult and Tomlinson gradually develop a good chemistry with each other, the movie’s stand- out performance comes from Ewan McGregor in his portrayal of Elmont, leader of the king’s guard. It’s refreshing to see McGregor in a lighter role after serious films such as “The Impossible” and “Beginners,” and his balance between Elmont’s moments of comic relief and regal seriousness make for some of the best scenes in the film. In contrast, Stanley Tucci’s Roderick, the traitorous adviser and husband-to-be of Isabelle, comes off as buffoonish and caricaturish—fitting for a fairy tale villain, perhaps. The true standout antagonists are Bill Nighy and John Kassir as the re- spective big and little heads of Fallon, leader of the giants. Fallon shines as a vicious and vindictive villain with no mercy for humans. However, for the most part, the giants are merely fearsome and grotesque creatures born of CGI, crude and bumbling if only to help convince the audience that Jack can plausibly slay them. 
“Jack the Giant Slayer” consistently hits the right chord with its wry, almost tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. Especially in dialogue, we’re treated to what nearly qualifies as witty banter but perhaps is just clever wordplay (Roderick saying “spill the beans,” for instance). Moreover, the writing remains very faithful to the source material—elements from both the classic “Jack and the Beanstalk” tale and lesser-known Cornish story “Jack the Giant Killer” are deftly integrated without the spirit of either being compromised. Still, at some moments, the film seems to assume a young audience and deliberately walks viewers through certain plot points. Add this on top of several plot contrivances and a deus ex machina in the film’s latter half, and the predictability soon becomes tiresome. Nonetheless, “Jack and the Giant Slayer” is an enjoyable film—if taken as a fairy tale adaptation. The audience can’t expect innovative plot devices or new dimensions for the characters when most viewers have been familiar with the basic premise of the film since childhood. What do shine are the stunning visuals and the often clever writing, which transform what could have been a stilted premise into an exciting revisit of our childhood fantasies.

Ever since students signed Yuqi Hou '15's <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/20/us-petitions-nap-space/"">petition rallying for a space to nap in Harvard Yard, numerous media outlets have chimed in to opine on the idea. While some applaud the concept, others find it further proof of Harvard students' snobbery.<!--more-->Is a cozy room for a quick snooze a brilliant idea or an awkward encounter waiting to happen? Here's what some have to say on the matter.Lauren Landry, <a href=""http://bostinno.com/2013/02/25/harvard-nap-room-harvard-students-petition-for-nap-room-on-campus/#ss__302091_1_0__ss"">BostInno: ""What I think, however, is that Harvard students are complaining about merely being college students.""This article drips with sarcasm, mocking ""the woes of a Harvard student"" and arguing that we need to let go of our preschool days, suck it up, and drink another ""grande soy caramel macchiato with whipped cream."" What it doesn't take into account is Harvard's punishing geography for weary Quad residents, who are faced with a 15-minute commute by foot to get to class in the Yard. It is often not feasible for these students to return to their dorms for a nap, when the two-way trip will take 30 minutes.
Though we don't appreciate the condescending tone, we do enjoy the photo gallery of ""unflattering faces you might make in a communal nap room"" that accompanies the article.<a href=""http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/02/25/harvard-university-may-create-nap-room-for-students/"">Red Politics: ""In case Harvard University needed another reason to be superior, a nap room for students to snooze in between classes might be in the works.""Despite the predictably snarky lede, this article is a bit more reasonable, focusing on the benefits of napping during the day. Naps can increase productivity and enhance problem solving, while minimizing the sleep deficit that many overbooked Harvard students confront. And yes, we agree, a nap space could be the clincher over Yale (especially now that football is <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/column/the-brothers-samuels/article/2012/11/16/harvard-yale-football-the-brothers-samuels/"">no longer a competition).<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/22/harvard-nap-room_n_2741391.html  "">Huffington Post: ""We can't say we disagree with Hou's idea. We have nap rooms here at the Huffington Post, and they're often overbooked.""As proud supporters of their own office nap space, the Huffington Post has an experienced take on the controversy. Citing Harvard Medical School professor Robert Stickgold, the article emphasizes the importance of an ideal spot to nap, with reduced light, little noise, and cool temperatures. Maybe a nap space is a practical solution for fatigued upperclassmen schlepping their lives on their backs through the Yard after all.

The Harvard baseball team played outside for the first time this year over the weekend, but it did not take the Crimson long to adjust to the cold.Playing in Charlottesville, Va., on Friday, Harvard (1-3) opened up its season with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Bucknell (1-9). Tied at one in the bottom of the tenth with two outs and two strikes, captain Rob Wineski singled up the middle to bring home the winning run.The walk-off win matched the Crimson’s victory total in its first 17 games last year and was coach Bill Decker’s first win at the helm of Harvard.Harvard resumed action at Davenport Field against No. 19 Virginia (12-0) just an hour after the win over the Bison. Although the Crimson out-hit the Cavaliers, the team could not string together any offense and fell, 3-0.Harvard played both teams again on Saturday and lost both after taking early leads.
VIRGINIA 11, HARVARD 5The Crimson jumped out to a two-run lead in the top of the first after a series of Cavaliers’ throwing errors. Junior shortstop Carlton Bailey scored on a wild pitch and freshman second baseman Mitch Klug followed shortly after on a throwing error.But a seven-run Virginia fifth doomed Harvard to an 11-5 loss. Sophomore Matt Timoney (0-1) could not finish the inning after coming in in relief for starter Peter Kaplan, who had allowed three earned through four.Timoney gave up six runs on four hits,, before being pulled with two outs left in the fifth. The Cavaliers ended the inning up 10-4 and cruised from there, as the Crimson only managed two more hits.BUCKNELL 7, HARVARD 5Harvard got off to a similarly hot start in the first of Saturday’s double-gamer, going up 4-0 through two as freshman DJ Link and sophomore Brandon Kregel both tallied two RBIs in the first and second, respectively.But, just as would happen later that afternoon, a disastrous bottom of the fifth prevented the Crimson from securing the victory, with the Bison bagging six runs on six hits to jump out to a 7-4 lead. The teams would remain scoreless thereafter, as Bucknell and Harvard split their weekend series.Kregel, Link, and Bailey finished the weekend tied for the team-lead with seven hits.VIRGINIA 3, HARVARD 0The Crimson was up for a tough test in the form of Virginia starting pitcher Brandon Waddell, who struck out 15 of the 18 batters he faced in his last outing against Toledo.

For the second time in two nights, Harvard faced a 1-1 deadlock after 60 minutes of regulation. But this time, the Crimson found itself on the wrong end of a back-door overtime winner.A day after upsetting the No. 1 team in the country in overtime, the Harvard men’s hockey team fell to Princeton, 2-1, off a sudden-death strike from junior forward Andrew Calof. With the loss, the Crimson (9-17-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) concludes the ECAC regular season in last place for the first time in program history and will travel to No. 18 Dartmouth for the first round of the conference tournament next weekend.“We’re obviously disappointed,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I give Princeton a lot of credit; they had the better of shots. We had a lot of great chances, great looks, but we didn’t play our best game by any means.”With just over a minute left in the extra frame, Princeton coach Bob Prier pulled senior goaltender Mike Condon for an extra attacker after a timeout. The Tigers (10-14-5, 8-10-4) needed a win to clinch home ice for the first round of the ECAC tournament.On the ensuing faceoff in the Harvard zone, it appeared that the gamble would backfire. After the Crimson came away with the puck, freshman Kyle Criscuolo launched a cross-rink shot. But the play ended in icing as the attempt sailed past the unguarded cage by several feet.
Seconds later, Prier’s bet paid off. With less than 40 ticks left, senior defenseman Michael Sdao found an open Andrew Calof on the far right post with a tape-to-tape cross from the point.Princeton dominated the shot totals early with three power play opportunities in the first. But the Crimson escaped with a 1-0 lead off a shorthanded goal from senior forward Alex Fallstrom.Senior forward Luke Greiner won a defensive faceoff and pushed the puck up ice before setting up his classmate for a breakaway. Fallstrom, who had the overtime winner over No. 1 Quinnipiac the previous night, found the back of the net on a nifty backhander.“I think our penalty kill is really strong, so we came out of those situations really well,” Fallstrom said. “We didn’t let those [penalties] bring us down. That was a really good sign.”Less than nine minutes into the second period, Sdao evened things at one apiece for the Tigers. The defender’s strike came from just inside the blue line through traffic.In the final frame of regulation, Princeton unsuccessfully crashed the Harvard net several times. Girard stood tall between the pipes, recording 16 of his 45 saves in the third period.The Tigers finished the night with a 47-29 advantage in the shot department. The win allowed Princeton to leapfrog over Clarkson and Cornell in the ECAC standings for the No. 8 playoff seed.Harvard will open tournament play Friday evening for the first of a best-of-three weekend series in Hanover, N.H.  The Crimson lost to Dartmouth on the road, 3-2, on Jan. 12 before tying the Big Green, 1-1, at home on Feb. 10.“[Dartmouth is] a very good team. We’ve had two really tight games with them so far,” Donato said. “We’ll be excited about the playoffs, and that’s a great match-up.”After the game, Harvard recognized the team’s six graduating players as part of its Senior Night festivities. The overtime loss marked the final NCAA-sanctioned game at the Bright Hockey Center for Fallstrom, Greiner, captain Danny Biega, Marshall Everson, Conor Morrison, and Brendan Rempel.“They’re a special group. They really carried the locker room through some tough times this year. They kept everything positive and worked real hard,” Donato said. “As a coach, you get very attached to them. They’re great teammates, great people to coach and to be around. I’m very proud of how far they’ve come, both on and off the ice, and I’m excited heading into the playoffs because of the kind of character they have and the way they were able to play last year.”—Staff writer Michael D.

It was a tough weekend for the No. 14 Harvard’s men’s volleyball team, which saw its six-game winning streak end on Friday. The Crimson only won one set of seven in its road trip against George Mason and Princeton.Harvard recently completed arguably the best few weeks of play in program history. Most notably, for the first time in program history, Harvard beat No. 9 Penn State in a 3-0 sweep on Feb. 15. But the Crimson lacked the same momentum that brought it into the national rankings.“I think this weekend was a wake-up call for us,” junior co-captain Nick Madden said. “It’s disappointing to lose two games. We didn’t feel like we played our best volleyball…. We played two of the strongest teams in the league away at their place, with the crowd and home-court advantage.”PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 1It was a packed house in Princeton’s Dillon Gym as Harvard and its rival went head-to-head in a decisive league game. The Tigers (7-3, 5-2 EIVA) were able to clinch at least the second place spot in the EIVA with their victory over the Crimson (9-4, 5-3), which now sits in third place in the conference.
Harvard took the third frame, 25-14, on Saturday, but it wasn’t enough, as Princeton was the first to get to three, taking the fourth set by the same score.“Today we rallied in the third game and really had a lot of energy and some good moments,” Madden said. “We hit well on offense, [and] our passing was good. We put the pressure on them and made them make mistakes.”Madden tied with sophomore outside hitter DJ White for most kills in the game for Harvard at nine. Right behind him with the second most kills was freshman starter Brendan Clemens, who had six kills Saturday.The Tigers’ strength on the defensive end showed in their 22 blocks, led by senior Michael Dye with seven and junior Pat Schwagler who had five.“We were having a tough time diversifying our offense and finding our rhythm from every position on the court,” co-captain Rob Lothman said.The Crimson collected a total of 30 digs on Saturday, mostly thanks to junior libero Chris Gibbons, who individually added 12.Despite having four more digs than the Tigers, Madden felt his team didn’t play its best.“I felt like our defense, blocking, and serve receive could have been a little bit stronger,” Madden said.It was a close match in the second and third sets. Harvard’s greatest lead came when it was up 14-10 in the second before Princeton went on a five-point run and then held on tight for a close 25-22 victory. The Tigers sat most of their starters in the third to allow the Crimson to win its only game of the match. After taking a quick breather, Princeton proved resilient in the fourth, establishing a substantial lead after a 6-6 start and securing the match.GEORGE MASON 3, HARVARD 0

Taking the field for the first time this season, the Harvard softball team went 2-3 at the Florida Atlantic Classic.The Crimson—fielding a young team—picked up wins against Ball State (8-5) and host Florida Atlantic (6-10), but it fell at the hands of Michigan State (9-7), Eastern Michigan (4-5), and Jacksonville (11-4).Harvard used the weekend to test different lineups and combinations, as the team played together for the first time with the new freshman class.Sophomore pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz started three of the five games, and freshmen Jamie Halula and Morgan Groom got one start each and pitched in relief.“I think what we did a good job of was reading scouting reports and trying to match pitchers to lineups,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “[Against Michigan State] we knew a lefty-lefty matchup would be really effective. We ended up starting Gabby, which worked out really well for us because she kept us in the game.”
MICHIGAN STATE 1, HARVARD 0The Crimson was held to only two hits in seven innings and was unable to score after singles by sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz in the fourth and sophomore left fielder Andrea Del Conte in the seventh.“I think the biggest thing we need to work on is becoming more of an offensive powerhouse,” said junior co-captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson. “We have good batters, but we just need to string more hits together. It’s something that will come with time.”Ruiz took her first loss of the season after allowing three hits in 2.1 innings of work. The Spartans’ only run came in the second, when sophomore catcher Ellie Stoffer reached on a fielding error and was singled home by freshman shortstop Destinee Luna.HARVARD 3, FLORIDA ATLANTIC 2Harvard held the lead for most of the game after putting the first run on the board in the bottom of the third. Del Conte singled and stole second, and she was doubled home by third baseman Kasey Lange.The Owls came back with two in the fourth after Ruiz gave up back-to-back doubles to sophomore designated hitter Laura Mann and junior shortstop Shelby Knox.After falling behind, 2-1, the Crimson responded with a pair in the fifth and both teams went scoreless for the remainder of the game. After a leadoff single, designated player Haley Davis advanced to second on a sacrifice and scored on a single by Lantz.Lantz moved to second on an intentional walk and came home on a Stephanie Regan single.Ruiz picked up her second win in as many starts, allowing four hits in her first career complete game.

The Harvard women’s basketball team continued to scale the Ivy League rankings, taking down Penn, 67-54, on Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The victory, which comes just a day after the Crimson (17-8, 8-3 Ivy) halted Princeton’s 33-game league win streak, lifts the squad to a tie with the Quakers (15-10, 8-3) for second place in the Ancient Eight.For Harvard, it was a chance to exact revenge upon a team that had defeated it, 77-72, in a tricky road contest on Feb. 15.Junior guard Christine Clark ran the floor with a game-high 18 points and seven rebounds. Clark was trailed by sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who also had seven boards and added 14 points.It was a solid night for the Crimson’s senior class, which was honored in a special pre-game ceremony. Miriam Rutzen, Elle Hagedorn and Victoria Lippert, the three veterans to suit up for the contest, combined for 21 points, 18 rebounds and eight assists.Harvard opened the contest with stifling defense that held Penn to 1-of-18 shooting from the field until Penn senior guard Alyssa Baron knocked down a three at 5:32 in the first frame, the first long-range make of the game for her team.
But Baron, who put up 13 points through the game, was unable to close in further on the Crimson. Layups from Rutzen and Clark, combined with a pair of Fagbenle foul shots, gave Harvard a 20-point advantage, 33-13.From there, despite efforts from freshman guard Keiera Ray, who had a team-high 14 points, Harvard continued to hold a commanding lead and play a clean game, with just four fouls in the closing stanza.—Staff writer Cordelia F.

The ECAC tournament got off to a rocking start for the Harvard women’s hockey team on Friday afternoon.Freshman forward Miye D’Oench provided the spark the Crimson needed to take home a momentous victory over Dartmouth after a quiet first frame-and-a-half.D’Oench picked up a loose puck off of a broken play and carried it into the zone. Opposing goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft came flying out of the crease to no avail, as the Dartmouth goaltender could not break the momentum of the charging D’Oench, who lost her balance and took the puck into the back of the net with her.“I think everything we do is started by playing physical, tough defense,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We work from there, move it up the ice, and try to start a rush if we can.”The go-ahead goal was reviewed and upheld as No. 6/7 Harvard (23-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) went on to beat the Big Green (16-10-5,11-7-4 ECAC), 3-0, in the first of the best of three opening round series.
The night was special for Harvard coach Katey Stone, who reached the 400-win plateau in the successful outing.“It was incredible,” Dempsey said. “It was a really emotional day for [coach Stone] especially, but to be a part of something like this is much greater than this team. It’s the program, the tradition, and Harvard hockey.”Fresh off her ECAC rookie of the year award, freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer was perfect in her first postseason appearance, stopping all of the Dartmouth’s 21 attempts on net.“I think everything kind of clicked,” Maschmeyer said. “It was an awesome first game.”Though the squad couldn’t find the back of the net early on, Harvard set the tone for what would turn out to be a one-sided affair. Through thirty minutes, the Crimson outshot its opponent 20-11.Dempsey and junior forward Lyndsey Fry’s agility led to opportunities in close, but freshman forward Mary Parker had the best opportunity of the opening frame. The freshman collected a rebound and launched a shot just wide of a net left open by an out-of-position Holdcroft.“We just try to get pucks at the net and create traffic in front,” Dempsey said. “Sometimes they’re not going in but the one thing we control is how hard we keep working.”In the end, Harvard finished with a 42-21 advantage in shots on goal.After nearly two periods without a a penalty, the Crimson power play unit took over in the third period.Junior forward Kalley Armstrong received a cross-ice pass from sophomore defender Michelle Picard on the man-advantage and slid the puck behind Holdcroft to provide the first of two insurance goals.

After starting Sunday down by 34 points to rival Princeton, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team could not complete the comeback at the Ivy Championship meet, finishing second in the Ancient Eight. Harvard finished nearly two hundred points ahead of the third-place finisher, Columbia, despite taking home only one win on Sunday when freshman Kendall Crawford won the 200-yard backstroke. The win was one of two Crawford wins on the weekend, and it came with fellow swimmers freshman Danielle Lee placing fourth and senior Caroline Weaver finishing eighth. Coach Stephanie Wriede Morowski said that the team, which set program records in the 1,650 freestyle and the 100 freestyle, had started poorly on the first day of the competition but had done better than Princeton over the weekend. “I thought that the team did great,” Morowski said. “We didn’t get the win, but you can’t define a season by one championship meet. It was a very good team effort in losing to the champions. While Princeton was a better team, I think we outswam them the second two days after a shaky start. However, that’s sports, and we did a really good job overall.”
 Morowski said that what separated this Harvard team from past squads she had coached was the chemistry in the locker room. Although all the girls on the team are very different, Morowski said that the myriad personalities meshed well together. “I think this team really believed in not only themselves but also in each other,” Morowski said. “You have 20 different personalities, and they found a way to come together. The way this team is, they are going to be great on any different day. It is stuff like a swimmer going to a diver and telling them that I believe in you. We have always had that on teams, but this team took it to a new level, and probably they think they are so different in terms of their personalities that they knew what they needed to do as a team.” This was the eleventh straight meet that the Crimson finished second to the Tigers. Harvard, which is ranked 22nd in the nation, came into the meet 7-0 against fellow Ivy League foes in dual meets but struggled out of the gate. The team won only one race on Thursday, with senior diver Brittany Powell taking home the top spot in the one-meter diving event, but bounced back Friday with nine top-five finishes, highlighted by a 200 medley relay win over Columbia. Junior Sara Li was a consistent force for the Crimson over the weekend, earning a new program record in the 50m freestyle with her 22.46 finish and winning the 200m freestyle the following day.  “It was an awesome weekend on all fronts,” Li said. “The Ivy Championships are really cool, and we went in hoping to win it and although that didn’t happen, we stayed together and we showed incredible heart. I think this made us realize why we are proud to be a part of this team and to be part of Harvard. It was also very motivating for next year for a very young team. We are proud of how everybody supported each other this weekend.”

No. 17 received a forwarding pass and swept across the crease to beat Boston Bruins goaltender Anton Khudobin. It wasn’t the first goal the 23-year-old forward had scored at TD Garden, but this one was different.The last time Alex Killorn ‘12 had played at the Garden, he scored a first-period goal to help the Harvard men’ hockey team past Northeastern, 4-3, in the 2012 Beanpot consolation game. In his return to Boston Saturday afternoon, Killorn found the back of the net once more in the opening frame, this time as a rookie for the Tampa Bay Lightning.In his 11th career NHL game, Killorn provided the Lightning (9-11-1) an early 2-0 lead before the Bruins responded with three unanswered tallies down the stretch. Boston center Brad Marchand struck on a 2-on-1 with 2:16 left in regulation to lift the Bruins (13-2-2) to a 3-2 win.“I thought we had a created a lot of momentum on the power play,” Killorn said. “A couple lapses that they capitalized on ended up being the story of the game.”Killorn’s goal came 8:38 into the first period on the power play. Lightning forward Teddy Purcell tucked a feed past the Bruins’ defense onto the stick of a charging Killorn, who deked around Khudobin for the score. The strike was the rookie’s third career NHL goal and fifth career NHL point.
“[The goal] felt good, especially to get it so quick in the game to kind of help the momentum of the team going forward,” Killorn said. “I’ve played here a few times, and it was nice to score.”Killorn added that he knew he had “50 or 60” supporters in the Garden stands.On the first power play of the day, the former Dunster House resident set up camp in front of the Boston net as Tampa Bay’s Steven Stamkos squeezed a close-angle shot past the goal line less than six minutes into the game. Killorn would ink his name on the score sheet three minutes later.The Bruins evened things up early in the second with two goals spaced 1:17 apart. Killorn was on the ice for the tying tally—a left-wing one-timer from Boston center Richard Peverley.Killorn’s presence was most felt on special teams Saturday. The rookie displayed offensive firepower not only on the power play but also on the penalty kill.With less than six minutes left in regulation, Lightning defenseman Brendan Mikkelson was tagged with a four-minute double-minor after a high stick on Bruins’ forward Milan Lucic. More than a minute into the Boston power play, Killorn forced a turnover in the Tampa Bay end and went coast-to-coast with the puck before losing control in the Bruins’ crease as Khudobin covered up for a pad save.“I was actually trying to do the similar play that I scored on my last goal,” Killorn said. “I lost the puck, but it ended up working out well because it kind of caught [Khudobin] in the five-hole. I thought it was going to sneak through, but he ended up just falling back on it, though.”Marchand produced the game-winner minutes later. A shorthanded shot from Stamkos bounced off the boards and allowed Boston’s Patrice Bergeron to set up the decisive 2-on-1 in the opposite direction.In the final minute and a half, Killorn and the Lightning looked for an offensive spark with an extra attacker but failed to produce the equalizer. Killorn finished with four shots, a minus-one rating, and a career-high 19 minutes of ice time.During his time at Harvard, Killorn led the Crimson in goals during his junior and senior seasons. The government concentrator graduated as a CCM Hockey All-American after posting a tournament-high 10 points during the 2012 ECAC postseason.Killorn enjoyed particular success in the Beanpot with five goals in eight tournament games, including four in his last four. The night before his return to the Garden, Killorn was in the Bright Hockey Center audience as his old team upset No. 1 Quinnipiac.“We’re so thrilled and proud of what Alex is doing right now,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said after Harvard’s 2-1 win Friday. “He’s a great kid and really kind of a role model for what we want to represent as a program.”After Saturday’s game at the Garden, Tampa Bay head coach Guy Boucher berated his squad for unnecessary offensive gambles in the closing minutes. But he had nothing but praise for Killorn’s performance.“Alex Killorn has been terrific for us every single game,” Boucher said. “He makes it happen; he’s a two-way guy, pays the price offensively and defensively. He’s been terrific for us.”—Staff writer Michael D. Ledecky can be reached at mledecky@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/mdledecky"">@mdledecky.

It's common knowledge that Harvard's libraries house the country's second largest book collection. To those of you unimpressed by shelves upon shelves of dusty tomes, these more eccentric acquisitions may pique your interest. We at Flyby have compiled a list of the quirky, the bizarre, and the questionably useful relics found in Harvard's libraries.<!--more-->A lock of Nathaniel Hawthorne's hairIn a note that accompanies this unusual artifact, Hawthorne's publisher J.T. Field explains: ""Here is a golden curl which adorned the head of Nathaniel Hawthorne when he lay a little child in his cradle. It was given to me many years ago by one near and dear to him..."" For fans of the author, or anybody with a creepy hair fetish, this relic may tickle your fancy.Bathing trunks
These articles of clothing circa 1890 to 1930 may have belonged to members of Harvard's early swim or crew teams. Something tells us they're not your brother’s board shorts. Check these out to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of men's aquatic fashion.Le Whif Breathable ChocolateIn 2009, Professor David A. Edwards developed <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/4/3/chocolate-lovers-get-a-whiff-of/  "">Le Whif, canisters that contain tiny particles of chocolate that can be inhaled. By ""whiffing"" these particles, you are able to taste chocolate without actually acquiring the calories that usually accompany the sweet treat. The canisters come in flavors such as chocolate raspberry and chocolate mint. Unfortunately, the ""whiffable"" chocolate cannot be sampled in the library. Le womp.Musket balls from the Revolutionary WarThese incendiary items date from 1775, when Continental soldiers were housed at Harvard in Mass Hall, Hollis, Stoughton, and Holden Chapel. While Hollis Hall was being remodeled in the late 1950s, five gray musket balls, thought to date from the Revolutionary War, were found between the floorboards in the hall. Please do not use checking out these as an excuse to ""bomb"" your next exam.Brick from Widener LibraryOne of the collection's more mundane items is a brick that blew off of Widener during a storm in 1989. While we at Flyby are not quite certain of the brick’s utility, perhaps it would be useful to reflect on some existential questions. If a brick falls off Widener during a storm, will anybody hear it?

Facing a rising chorus of calls to reform mental health services on campus, Harvard officials are emphasizing mental health resources and financial support systems already available to students.On Feb. 21, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/anonymous-schizophrenia-help/"">an anonymous Crimson op-ed written by an undergraduate who suffers from schizophrenia sparked student conversation in dining halls, on social media websites, and over email lists about perceived problems in the availability of mental health services at Harvard. That conversation culminated in <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/22/mental-health-yard-rally/"">a next-day rally outside Massachusetts Hall that drew more than 150 students, including the four current and former Undergraduate Council presidents and vice presidents.Students at the rally said they were moved by claims made by the author of the anonymous op-ed, who, facing $650 a month in antipsychotic drug costs, argued that Harvard is still not doing enough to provide adequate mental health care for students, especially for those facing emergency expenses.“I can apply for $5,000 to study bat droppings over the summer, but there is no application to pay for the treatment that enables me to function,” the student wrote.In an interview this past Thursday, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds described the anonymous op-ed as “concerning” and said that administrators work hard to address students’ mental health concerns. Still, she took care to highlight the resources the University already offers.
“Students have questions and they should raise those questions. I think it’s very important for students to do that. But I also think it’s important for students to understand, as fully as they possibly can, what’s actually going on on campus and what’s being provided,” Hammonds said.This past Friday, eight days after the anonymous student’s account ran in The Crimson, Paul J. Barreira, the director of University Health Services, published <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/1/huhs-services-offered/"">his own op-ed in The Crimson. In the piece, Barreira called attention to several improvements made to Student Mental Health Services over the last decade: the addition of wellness tutors in Houses, the hiring of additional full-time psychiatrists, the doubling of outside mental health visits for students on Harvard insurance, and the addition of two full-time access coordinators to schedule initial psychiatric visits.Barreira emphasized in his op-ed that all students are automatically enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan, which covers prescription drugs and services at HUHS. He cautioned that students should carefully review the coverage provided by their own plans before electing to waive the Harvard-sponsored plan.Even students who elect to waive enrollment in the Harvard plan are still eligible for financial support from the University in cases of unexpected medical costs, according to Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.The Beneficiary Aid Program, which awarded nearly $70,000 to more than 400 different students last year, reimburses students facing emergency medical expenses at a rate equal to an individual’s overall financial aid package, according to Neal.“A student on 90 percent financial aid likely would be awarded 90 percent of the cost of the unexpected expense,” he wrote in a statement.The Committee on Financial Aid meets regularly throughout the year to consider requests, but students with urgent needs should alert the Financial Aid Office or a Resident Dean to expedite the process, Neal wrote.At the rally for improved mental health care over a week ago, students and members of the UC called on the administration to hire more therapists, clarify policies governing students taking time off, and guarantee reasonable turnaround times for decisions from the Financial Aid Office, especially in emergency situations.Despite Barreira’s op-ed, student activists involved in the newly formed “Coalition to Reform Mental Health Services at Harvard” plan to continue their activism efforts and sustain the energy of the original rally, according to Coalition organizers. As of Saturday afternoon, the group had amassed nearly 300 members.The week’s heightened interest in mental health led UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, in conjunction with the Student Mental Health Liaisons, to email undergraduates about the resources available to students.“We want to use this moment of heightened campus interest around this issue to encourage students to continue asking questions about existing services and policies, and—most importantly—to inform students about resources should you need to seek help now or in the future,” they wrote.Barreira plans to attend a UC-sponsored mental health town hall event on Thursday at 7 p.m. in Emerson 105. In addition, SMHL is finalizing plans for a new video project based on the popular LGBT anti-bullying series “It Gets Better.”—Staff writer Quinn D.

As the Digital Public Library of America—a new online repository for text and media sources—prepares to launch next month, faculty and administrators at the University said they hope its creation will mark the beginning of a nationwide push for open access.According to Robert C. Darnton ’60, Harvard University librarian and one of the original visionaries behind the DPLA, the initiative is the first step towards the creation of a national digitized library that is free and open to the general public—or, as Darnton envisions, a “modern, digital Library of Alexandria.”Though it was first envisioned at Harvard in October 2010, the DPLA has since collaborated with other schools, national public libraries, and international enterprises in an effort to expand its reach and gather support.The DPLA will launch on April 18 with its special collections that have already been digitized, allowing anyone with an internet connection to access its treasure trove of academic articles and primary sources in one centralized location.“[The DPLA] is ambitious, it’s helpful, it’s the leader in providing access to the cultural heritage of an entire nation,” said Peter Suber, Director of the Harvard Open Access Project—an initiative at the Law School’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society aimed at expanding open access to research.
A push for open access has long been a trend at Harvard. In 2008, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences passed its first open access policy, which made  the scholarly work of Harvard faculty and researchers available through the Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard repository.According to computer science professor Stuart M. Shieber ’81, who authored the original open access policy, over 9000 scholarly articles have been deposited to DASH since 2008.Twenty-four universities around the world have created open access initiatives based on the Harvard model since 2008, said Suber, who is currently advising 12 other universities that are also designing open access models.Faculty and administrators said once the DPLA launches, the new digital library will assist professors in their research and provide them with a broader audience for their publications.According to history professor David R. Armitage, the opening of the DPLA will make a large amount of previously inaccessible historical resources, especially those focused on American history, available for teaching and research.English department chair W. James Simpson said he thinks the DPLA will also give the humanities the public exposure more often granted to the sciences.“I think as long as the law permits it, then open access is exactly what the humanities need,” Simpson said.But even as the DPLA’s launch date creeps closer, Harvard is far from accomplishing its goals in terms of open access. Suber said that he is working on building the rate of deposits in the DASH and hopes that more universities will commit to open access.Shieber said that overall he is optimistic about the future of a digital library.“Even though we are not even close to being there, the research community and the publishing community have come to the realization that that’s where we’re headed,” Shieber said.—Staff writer Francesca Annicchiarico can be reached at fannicchiarico01@college.harvard.edu.

In the aftermath of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, much attention has been paid to student-teacher relationships at Harvard and to the terms of collaboration policies and Administrative Board protocols. Among others, Sarah Lawrence College professor Nicolaus Mills ’60 and former Dean of Harvard College Harry R. Lewis ’68 recently <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/28/fall-of-harvard-academics/"">presented their critical appraisals of Harvard’s predominant campus values in interviews with the Crimson, finding faults with a culture of academic overachievement, with administrative proceedings, and with the scant efforts paid by some faculty members in the teaching of undergraduates. We at The Crimson believe that it is critically important to examine the pressures exerted by extracurricular life and pre-professional attitudes on students in all extracurricular groups, including our own.The idea that an air of excessive seriousness surrounds extracurricular pursuits here at Harvard is not an entirely new one: As early as 1957, The Crimson <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1957/5/25/extracurricular-activities-and-professionalism-pno-aspect/"">pointed out the growing professionalism of student groups, warning that activities taking place outside of the classroom could end up demanding more and more of the efforts and dedication of undergraduates at the severe expense of academics. “There is evidence that the leisurely quest for…constructive relaxation…has been transformed into an intense drive for the kind of competence that has always been held more characteristic of the business world,” Steven R. Rivkin ’58 wrote in the year before his graduation.Extracurricular life at Harvard is certainly rich, but also intense, time demanding, and not insulated from pre-professional pressures. True, many of us will have been partly motivated in our extracurricular endeavors by the desire to strengthen credentials for future job or graduate school applications. In this mix of passion and aspirations, however, lay the seeds of a culture of extracurricular over-commitment, which businessman and journalist James Atlas cogently <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/opinion/sunday/meet-the-new-super-people.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">described in 2011 in an op-ed for the New York Times, in which he talked of an increase in “striving, working, doing” at colleges around the country. At its best, such a campus culture fosters entrepreneurship and hard work. At its worst, it causes students with overly hectic schedules to resort to academic shortcuts.While there is no hard-and-fast response to the culture of over-commitment that surrounds extracurricular life at Harvard, we would like to quote the words of Harry R. Lewis, who <a href=""http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~lewis/SlowDown2004.pdf"">wrote an open letter to students in 2004 about such matters: “Empty time is not a vacuum to be filled: It is the thing that enables the other things on your mind to be creatively rearranged,” Lewis wrote. “Like the empty square in the 4-by-4 puzzle which makes it possible to move the other 15 pieces around.”

It was a sweet homecoming for the Harvard men’s tennis team, which celebrated its first home match in a month with a 4-3 victory over Indiana on Saturday. The No. 23 Crimson’s win improved the team to 7-4 on the season and marked its fifth win in its last six matches.The Hoosiers (6-7) started strong on Saturday, breaking Harvard’s serve at No. 1 and No. 2 in the early going. On the third court, sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Kelvin Lam scored an 8-4 doubles win to give the Crimson an early head start.Although Harvard’s first team of junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen fell 8-5, freshman Nicky Hu and senior co-captain Andy Nguyen fought back from down a break to capture their match, 8-6, and secure the doubles point for Harvard. Andy Nguyen and Hu improved their record to 6-2 in doubles play for the year.Andy Nguyen also took control in singles, where he scored a 6-4, 6-3 win over Indiana’s Dimitrije Tasic at No. 4 to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead. He is now 7-1 in dual matches on the fourth court for the season.But the Hoosiers were ahead in other matches, and took straight-set victories over sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri at No. 2 and Steinroeder at No. 3 to even that match at 2-2. On the first court, Denis Nguyen won the first set over the Hoosiers’ Isade Juneau 6-4, but then lost the second 1-6. In the decisive third set, he scored a 6-3 win to put Harvard ahead again.
The bottom two singles spots would decide the match for the Crimson. Hu, playing at No. 5, clinched the match for Harvard with his comeback 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 win. Lam fell in a third-set tiebreaker just after Hu’s win to seal the 4-3 Crimson victory.On Sunday, the Crimson hosts two more matches, taking on Louisville in the morning and crosstown rival Boston University in the afternoon.—Staff writer Justin C.

Taking the field for the first time this season, the Harvard softball team went 2-3 at the Florida Atlantic Classic.The Crimson—fielding a young team—picked up wins against Ball State (8-5) and host Florida Atlantic (6-10), but it fell at the hands of Michigan State (9-7), Eastern Michigan (4-5), and Jacksonville (11-4).Harvard used the weekend to test different lineups and combinations, as the team played together for the first time with the new freshman class.Sophomore pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz started three of the five games, and freshmen Jamie Halula and Morgan Groom got one start each and pitched in relief.“I think what we did a good job of was reading scouting reports and trying to match pitchers to lineups,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “[Against Michigan State] we knew a lefty-lefty matchup would be really effective. We ended up starting Gabby, which worked out really well for us because she kept us in the game.”
MICHIGAN STATE 1, HARVARD 0The Crimson was held to only two hits in seven innings and was unable to score after singles by sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz in the fourth and sophomore left fielder Andrea Del Conte in the seventh.“I think the biggest thing we need to work on is becoming more of an offensive powerhouse,” said junior co-captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson. “We have good batters, but we just need to string more hits together. It’s something that will come with time.”Starting pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz took her first loss of the season after allowing three hits in 2.1 innings of work. The Spartans’ only run came in the second, when sophomore catcher Ellie Stoffer reached on a fielding error and was singled home by freshman shortstop Destinee Luna.HARVARD 3, FLORIDA ATLANTIC 2Harvard held the lead for most of the game after putting the first run on the board in the bottom of the third. Del Conte singled and stole second, and she was doubled home by third baseman Kasey Lange.The Owls came back with two in the fourth after Ruiz gave up back-to-back doubles to sophomore designated hitter Laura Mann and junior shortstop Shelby Knox.After falling behind, 2-1, the Crimson responded with a pair in the fifth and both teams went scoreless for the remainder of the game. After a leadoff single, designated player Haley Davis advanced to second on a sacrifice and scored on a single by Lantz.Lantz moved to second on an intentional walk and came home on a Stephanie Regan single.Ruiz picked up her second win in as many starts, allowing four hits in her first career complete game.

Five Crimson squash players competed in this weekend’s men’s CSA Individual Championships at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., No. 2 seed junior Ali Farag was unable to defend his national title, losing in the semifinals to eventual champion No. 3 seed Amr Khaled Khalifa of St. Lawrence University. For the fourth year in a row, the national championship went to a competitor in his first season at the collegiate level.After upsetting Princeton 5-4 in the CSA Potter Cup semifinals on Feb. 19, the Crimson lost in the title match against top-ranked Trinity, 6-3. After similarly falling in the team championship last year, Harvard was redeemed by Farag’s individual title.“Obviously we are annoyed we lost to Trinity,” freshman Sam Goldberg said. “We think we can [win], we know we can [win]. But with the Princeton match as an example, even when Ali [Farag] lost, other people stepped up.”Last year as a sophomore transfer student from American University in Cairo, Farag, the number one ranked junior in the world, finished the season with a perfect 16-0 record, including a 3-0 (12-10, 11-8, 11-4) victory over Columbia’s Ramnit Tandon in the finals.This year, four Crimson players, Farag and fellow juniors Brandon McLaughlin, Nigel Koh, and Gary Power, competed in the Pool division, the top bracket at the tournament. Junior Tommy Mullaney competed for the Molloy Cup.
On the first day in Pool play, Farag won his first two matches against Michael Sunderland of Cornell in three games, 11-9, 11-9, 11-8, and Princeton’s Samuel Kang in four, 11-8, 9-11, 11-9, 11-9.  Power lost in the first round to Kang in straight sets, 13-11, 14-12, 11-8. Koh faced a similar fate in the first round, losing, 11-8, 13-11, 11-8.McLaughlin was the only other Crimson player to win in the first round, beating Dylan Ward of Princeton 3-0, 11-2, 11-2, 11-4, to move into the round of 16. He proceeded to lose to eventual champion Khalifa in straight sets, 12-10, 11-3, 11-5.On the second day of competition Farag got off to a rough start, dropping his first game against Rochester’s Andres Duany, 11-9, before winning three games in a row, 11-1, 11-6, 11-8. However, he was foiled in the next round against fellow Egyptian Khalifa.The match came down to the wire, going to five games. Farag jumped out to a two-game lead, winning 11-9 and 11-3. Yet Khalifa battled back to even up the match, 11-7, 11-6. With a spot in the title match on the line, the pair battled back and forth, until Khalifa pulled away to a 13-11 victory in the fifth game. Khalifa went on to win against top-seeded Todd Harrity of Princeton 3-0 in the finals.Although Farag was the lone member of the Crimson who remained in the championship bracket, Gary Power competed in the first round consolation quarterfinals and Brandon McLaughlin was in the second round consolation round of 16. Power dropped a 3-1  decision to Adam Perkiomaki of Rochester. McLaughlin suffered a similar fate, losing to Dartmouth’s Chris Hanson 3-1.In the Molloy division, Mullaney was ousted in the quarterfinals by Princeton’s Vivek Dinodia in straight sets.“As our coach always says, we are basically the same team as last year, with a few additions,” Goldberg said. “The thing that is so different about our team this year from last year, is that we are more mature.”Harvard closes out the season as the No. 2 team in the country while claiming a share of the Ivy League title for the first time since 2006. All five of the competitors in the CSA individual championships are juniors and will return next year.“Obviously [next year], with our captains leaving, there is going to be a different mentality, but we feel that if we can go in with the same intensity or maturity that we will be a force to be reckoned with next year,” Goldberg said. “Teams are going to be afraid to play us.”—Staff writer Jacob W.

In what would be the final meet for some Harvard seniors, a partial squad of the men’s swimming and diving team finished fourth at the ECAC Championships this past weekend at Blodgett Pool.With some members of the team not competing because of the Ivy League Championships taking place next weekend, the Crimson finished fourth out of a field of 19 total teams.“We were more interested in our performance as a group of Harvard guys, rather than to the other teams competing,” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “Given that it wasn’t our full team, we were really happy with the fourth-place finish.”Harvard won the 200-medley relay with strong swims by junior Jack Pretto on backstroke, Wurzbacher on breaststroke, senior Ryan Cutter on butterfly, and junior Will Brophy as the freestyle anchor.“[The four of us] were pretty excited about that race,” Brophy said. “We knew we had the guys on it to do really well and to potentially win it. When it came down to it in the finals we just stepped up.”
For seniors Wurzbacher and Cutter, the win came in the last meet of their Harvard swimming careers.“Jack and I we really wanted to get that win for the two seniors on the relay because they have put a ton of time and effort into our team,” Brophy said. “[Jack and I] knew that relay was just really big for the seniors…and it was amazing to do it for those two because they have worked really hard and deserved it.”The 200-medley win was only a small portion of the weekend for Pretto and Brophy. The two juniors both swam in five total finals: three relays and two individual races, which amounts to 14 total swims over the three days for each of them.“I wasn’t feeling great the whole way, my legs were getting tired and I was starting to have trouble with my breathing,” Brophy said.  “I just tried to keep the team in mind, and I had the mentality of just doing whatever the team needed me to do this weekend.”Brophy took home second place in the 50 freestyle, and Pretto took third in the 100-meter backstroke.“Jack had great swims all weekend, and Brophy was really impressive, particularly in some of the relays,” Wurzbacher said. “[Pretto and Brophy] performed well across the board and really led the team.”Freshman Robert Doles also had a standout weekend, winning the 400 individual medley and taking fourth in the 200 individual medley.“We also had some great swims from some of our younger guys,” Wurzbacher said. “We had a lot of our freshman in there this weekend. Evan Zheng stepped up and swam on the A-relay the other night, and Robert Doles swam really well in his individual events and the medley event.”Sophomore George Doran placed second in the three-meter dive, while sophomore Reed Snyder placed third in the 500 freestyle.“It was a really wonderful evening and great overall weekend,” Wurzbacher said. “Just to have all our teammates here supporting us was amazing.”

Fresh off a pair of top-three finishes at last weekend’s Indoor Heptagonal Championships, the qualifying members of the Harvard track and field team headed across the river to Boston University to compete in the ECAC/IC4A Indoor Championships.The squad’s standouts were up against stiffer competition than at Heps, which the women’s team won for the first time since 2000, but managed to turn in a number of strong individual performances. The Crimson women tallied 20 team points, which was good for 11th place, while the men finished in 18th place after recording 17 points on the weekend.“They call ECAC’s the ‘last chance meet’ for people who are trying to qualify for nationals,” senior Mary Hirst said. “There’s not as much of a team aspect as there is at Heps.”Senior pole vaulter Nico Weiler earned Harvard’s lone individual victory of the weekend, as he cleared 5.30 meters to take first place. The competition had a starting height of 4.80 meters, but Weiler elected to not make an attempt until the bar was set at 5.30 meters. At that point, only Connecticut junior Cory Duggan—who finished in second place—was in the competition.Weiler cleared the height on his first attempt, and Duggan elected to wait until the bar was raised to 5.44 meters to participate. Both competitors were unsuccessful in their efforts, and Weiler was granted first place for his 5.30-meter clearance.
“I think [Weiler] is capable of some tremendously special things,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “He’s just a phenomenal competitor.”Despite his standout performances this season, the senior did not qualify for next weekend’s NCAA Indoor Championships.“I think the outdoor system plays more to his strengths as a competitor—the indoor season is really just about hitting a mark,” Saretsky said.On the women’s side, junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu, who owns both the school and Ivy League record in the weight throw, took second place in the event behind Connecticut’s Victoria Flowers. Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson photography and multimedia editor, earned eight team points for the performance.The squad’s other co-captain, senior Sydnie Leroy, also picked up points for the squad in the pole vault. Leroy, who holds the school record in the event with a mark of 3.91 meters, cleared 3.75 meters on her first attempt to earn sixth place. George Mason’s Mandissa Marshall won the event with a meet-record vault of 4.23 meters.“[Ekechukwu and Leroy] both just stepped up tremendously this year,” Saretsky said. “The level of consistency is what’s really impressed me. Every meet, we can go out there and count on them to lead us, not just with their captaincy, but with their performances.”Hirst, another veteran of the women’s team, nearly broke her personal-best mark in the high jump on Saturday. Hirst, who holds the fifth-best jump in school history at 1.80 meters, cleared 1.78 meters, which was good for second place, her career-best finish at the ECAC meet.“She’s been over her best [height] from last year I don’t even know how many times,” Saretsky said. “It’s incredible how consistent she’s been this season.”The senior was topped by Connecticut’s Ilva Bikanova, who was one of four athletes to clear 1.78 meters. Bikanova finished the competition with one fewer miss than Hirst, earning her the event crown.“Four people finishing at one height is kind of unusual,” Hirst said. “That’s why it’s so important to have first-attempt clearances.”

After a two-day, three-game road trip, the Harvard women’s water polo team (10-4, 2-0 EIWA) stretched its winning streak to five, taking down Mercyhurst, Bucknell, and Gannon, 11-3, 13-9, and 10-5, respectively.The wins against the Lakers and the Bison marked the beginning of division play for the Crimson, which now sits at 2-0 in EIWA contests.The Harvard defense–headed by sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes–shutout Mercyhurst (5-5) in the first half of competition, while limiting Bucknell (3-4, 1-2) to just one goal in the final quarter of the game after going score-for-score earlier in the match.“I think we’ve really been trying to hone in on our defense,” co-captain Aisha Price said. “It would’ve been easy for it to become high-scoring games, but we wanted to focus on keeping goals out of the back of the net.”Dukes, with nine saves in both the matches against the Lakers and the Golden Knights and 11 against the Bison, finished the weekend with 29 saves.
HARVARD 10, GANNON 5After two strong team performances on Saturday, the Crimson was able to close out the weekend with a dominant win over Gannon (4-3). The win came after another solid defensive effort from Harvard, which tallied nine steals on the match. The game started slowly for the Crimson, taking a close, 3-2, lead over the Knights in the first eight minutes.But Harvard found its stride and went on a 2-1 run, securing a 5-3 halftime advantage. After a slow third period that saw both teams scoring one apiece, the Crimson widened the gap in the fourth quarter, putting four in the back of the net and only giving up one to the Knights. The win secured a perfect 3-0 weekend for Harvard and provided a confidence booster for the team moving forward in the season.“After this weekend, I think we have some confidence,” Price said. “Everyone put forth a really good effort and we came away with three big wins.”Freshman Charlotte Hendrix led the offense with four goals and an assist to cap the weekend at seven goals, while junior Shayna Price and freshman Yoshi Andersen netted two apiece.“I was very proud of the team this weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We talked all week about dedicating ourselves to the defensive end of the pool…and we did a really good job of pressing and making teams have to move the ball under pressure.”HARVARD 13, BUCKNELL 9Following an 11-3 win over Mercyhurst that saw six different players score, the Crimson cruised to its second victory of the weekend against Bucknell, taking down the Bison, 13-9. After shutting out the Lakers in the first half, Harvard’s defense received more pressure from the Bucknell front, but was bolstered by its offense, which netted four goals in the final quarter to secure the win.The Crimson jumped out to an early lead to begin the match, taking a 3-1 edge in the first quarter. But the Bison responded in suit, putting four in the back of the net to Harvard’s two, leaving the game on an even-playing field heading into halftime.After intermission, the Crimson came out strong and tallied four goals in the third and fourth quarters to earn a four-goal edge over Bucknell. Harvard allowed only one goal in the final eight, a defensive effort led by Dukes, who had 11 saves.

Freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer did it again.After getting benched against Clarkson last weekend and sitting out Tuesday’s contest against Yale, Maschmeyer registered her second straight shutout of Dartmouth in as many days, Saturday at Bright Hockey Center. With the 4-0 win, the No. 6/7 Harvard women’s hockey team (23-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) completed its two-game sweep of the Big Green (16-10-5,11-7-4 ECAC) and will play in the ECAC semifinals next weekend.Maschmeyer tallied 18 saves to record consecutive shutouts for the first time in her career. Friday, she stopped all 21 of Dartmouth’s attempts, her second-highest save tally in a shutout effort.“She’s played well, she’s done well, she’s practiced hard and she’s very good when there are a lot of shots taken,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “One of the things that I think was great was that it was an up and back game—we knew it was going to be—and she was focused and she was definitely sharp.”The Crimson defense helped Maschmeyer in the effort, thwarting the Big Green’s attempts to control the puck in the attacking zone and successfully clearing the puck from danger in times of trouble.
“I thought everybody played very well in front of her and played good defense,” Stone said.With the Harvard defense and Maschmeyer clicking, the home team only needed a single goal to complete its seventh straight quarterfinal sweep. It didn’t take long to get it.Just 17 seconds into the first period, junior forward Lindsey Fry got her team on the board. After skating behind Dartmouth’s net, Fry turned and shot a backhander across the Big Green’s goalie, Lindsay Holdcroft, and above her blocker for an early tally on the Crimson’s first shot of the game.“I think the biggest thing there was just taking it in with possession,” Fry said. “Lately we’ve really been focusing on getting pucks on net and it’s really all we try to do and I was just lucky enough that it went in.”Fry added another goal on a power play nearly two full periods later. With less than three minutes to go in the second, the junior located the puck after a save by Holdcroft and fully extended to push it back home, watching the puck get by a diving Holdcroft as Fry fell to the ice herself.“I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and put it away,” Fry said.Just like she did in the first game of the series, senior Kaitlyn Spurling provided a third-period insurance goal for the Crimson. With less than 10 minutes to play, Spurling gathered the puck along the boards, and curved toward the goal. Left open entering the slot, she fired a backhand past Holdcroft’s goalie to give Harvard a 3-0 advantage. The marker was Spurling’s seventh in her last seven games. She had only netted five goals in the previous 26 games this season.The Crimson piled on seven minutes later thanks to some precise passing. On the power play after a Dartmouth tripping penalty, freshman Mary Parker sent a pass from the red line across the ice to sophomore Samantha Reber in the center of the opposite circle. Reber then passed the puck back to Parker, who was waiting at the far post to tuck it into the net, putting an exclamation point on Harvard’s victory.“Our kids don’t quit,” Stone said. “I’m always satisfied with how hard they work so it was really good.”Harvard’s power-play unit scored twice on four opportunities a day after converting on two of its three man advantages. Entering the tournament, the Crimson’s power-play unit was a combined 1-for-15 over the previous four games.In its three home contests against Dartmouth this season, the Crimson outscored its visitors, 13-0. Harvard will now travel to take on second-seeded Clarkson. The game will be played in Ithaca, N.Y. because Cornell is the highest-ranked seed remaining. If the Crimson top the Golden Knights, it will move on to the tournament final, but Clarkson beat the Crimson, 3-1, in both of the two teams’ matchups thus far this year.“Those games we are going to have win differently than we did these games,” Fry said. “We definitely owe a couple teams some big wins.”“—Staff writer  Jacob D.

For the twelfth time in its history, the Ramsey Cup belongs to Harvard.On Sunday afternoon, sophomore Amanda Sobhy took her second straight women’s squash individual college national championship, defeating Trinity’s Kanzy El Defrawy in the final, 11-4, 11-5, 12-10.Sobhy did not lose a game all weekend, beating Gwendoline Tilghman of Yale, Rachel Goh of Penn, Danielle Letourneau of Cornell, and Yan Xin Tan of Penn to reach the finals.Six other Crimson women joined the top-seeded Sobhy to compete in the tournaments at Trinity this weekend. Co-captain Natasha Kingshott, 2010 individual national champion Laura Gemmell, sophomore Haley Mendez, and freshman Michelle Gemmell also competed for the Ramsey Cup.  Co-captain Sarah Mumanachit and sophomore Julianne Chu competed for the Holleran Cup.“The freshman and sophomore classes are so strong,” Kingshott said. “They form the foundation of our team.  As an upperclassman I am just so proud to see everything they have accomplished.”
Michelle Gemmell lost her opening match of the weekend, but stormed back with four straight victories to take the first round consolation trophy with her win over Pia Trikha of Penn, 11-2, 11-9, 11-5.“Michelle has been training really hard, and it showed [this weekend],” Sobhy said.The freshman lost her initial match to Trinity’s Catalina Pelaez, 8-11, 9-11, 6-11. But she then beat her teammate Kingshott, Princeton’s Rachel Leizman, and Cornell’s Jaime Larid, to reach the first-round consolation finals.“[Gemmell] had a great win against a girl that she had lost to in the Princeton match,” Kingshott said. “We were all really proud of her for getting revenge. She was really fired up for that match.”Mendez made it to the final of the second-round consolation before losing a close match to Pelaez, 10-12, 11-5, 11-3, 10-12, 9-11.“Haley had a great first round win,” Kingshott said. “She then lost to [El Defrawy], who lost to Amanda in the final. It was great that Haley was able to play [El Defrawy] so close in that second round match.”Mendez won her first round match over Penn’s Haidi Lala before losing to El Defrawy. She then beat Cornell’s Jesse Pacheco and Stanford’s Pamela Chua, to reach the second-round consolation finals.“I think Haley Mendez really stepped up,” Sobhy said. “She gave the No. 1 from Trinity a run for her money. She lost today, 11-9, in the fifth [to Trinity’s No. 2].  Haley just works so hard day in and day out.”It was a strong day all around for the Crimson, which won the team national championship two weekends ago.“All of the performances [this weekend] were just great,” Kingshott said.  “It is really difficult to come into this weekend and perform at your best. It is a long season so it is really impressive what all of these girls achieved in their matches.”

In the wake of last September’s assault on the American consulate in Benghazi, the right-wing punditocracy stirred with rage, convinced that the tragic murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three colleagues was proof of an Obama administration unfit for the task of safeguarding American lives in the Middle East. Building on the fringe narrative of Obama As Malevolent Outsider, Glenn Beck <a href=""http://www.wnd.com/2012/12/glenn-beck-obama-destined-for-prison/"">speculated aloud, “This is impeachable; the president might go to prison for this one.”Although nothing of a cheerleader for Obama administration foreign policy, I could not help but writhe with contempt over Beck’s newest outburst of on-air mania. Righteously incensed over the Benghazi boondoggle, the NATO intervention in the Libyan civil war, and the escalation of drone activity in South-Central Asia, partisan Republicans appear to have forgotten that 10 years ago, their own president sinned against America’s security on a far, far higher order.On the backs of a white-hot, festering national trauma, a small circle within George W. Bush’s administration deceived and distorted its way to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq—launching a war for “Iraqi freedom” that would undermine America’s international legitimacy, destabilize a pivot of regional order, and bleed Treasury coffers dry to no clear positive end. As the occupation dragged out and insurgent ambitions flared, only on occasion could one expect to hear calls for genuine accountability—usually from the pacifist left—and the Bush-Cheney administration coursed, battered but protected, to the end of a second term.A popular narrative on the Arab street and in the organizing halls of left-wing Western activists has it that the American invasion of Iraq was an immoral, neoimperial attack on a poor nation’s sovereignty. But being neither a pacifist nor an admirer of thuggish autocrats, I refuse to buy into this critique. Saddam Hussein was by far the most murderous dictator in the postcolonial Middle East; it is reasonable to argue that in a narrow sense, the Bush administration did secure “Iraqi freedom.” The Kurdish people in Iraq’s north are unambiguously safer and more prosperous than ever before. By the estimation of Christopher Hitchens, whom I admired very much for everything but his views on international relations, this is all that matters.But even assuming the best of intentions, shattering the Iraqi state was a crime of the highest order against American interests, regional stability, and fiscal responsibility. As an 11-year-old child, my realist Republican father warned me sternly that the power vacuum in Mesopotamia would be the greatest gift America could give to Iran’s grave-faced mullahs.  In short order, this has materialized as the political reality on the ground.
Its secular Sunni despot sacked, Baghdad under U.S.-backed Nuri al-Maliki is now the province of Iran-aligned religious foundations and street militias. Despite neoconservative fantasies of a permanent base for American power projection in the Levant and the Gulf, American-trained Iraqi troops now <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-10-08/world/35278813_1_syria-s-assad-assad-last-month-syrian-leader"">coordinate with Damascus, delivering aid and reinforcements to the Assad regime’s Iran-aligned butchers. And while in 1996 Richard Perle and Douglas Feith <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm"">reported to Benjamin Netanyahu that an ouster of Saddam Hussein would help to secure Israel within its regional sphere, the years since have seen a rise in Iranian aggression through proxy wars and nuclear grandstanding.If the Bush administration’s war could be dismissed merely as a catastrophic policy error with devastating consequences for regional security, Americans might be able to rest easy: Separated by the enormity of an ocean from the direct impact of Old World squabbles, we tend not to feel our transcontinental mistakes too palpably. However, liberals, conservatives, leftists, or libertarians, none of us can afford to forget the tremendous price tag incurred by the Iraq engagement, estimated by Joseph Stiglitz at <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090302200.html"">upwards of $3 trillion—which, unlike smaller sums spent on social programs, accrued straight to deficit and debt rolls without delivering an iota of benefit to the taxpayer. This is not the stuff of a minor, forgivable failure of intelligence. In a sane observer’s world, it is the Iraq invasion that calls for congressional interrogations and prison sentences, not the Benghazi blunder.It would be utterly quixotic of me to suggest bringing Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, or Wolfowitz to justice—not least because they’ve somehow managed to convince the American public, against a broad expert consensus, that Iraq was somehow worth it. Ten years later, as an American-funded Iraq teeters on the brink of vacuum, we must learn from the lesson of last decade’s failed neoconservative statesmen: When it comes to foreign adventurism, it’s never as easy as it looks. And in the interest of a more prudent culture of decision-making and a more proportionate culture of accountability, we must not forgive the policymakers who criminally saddled our generation with the ghosts of their Iraq idée fixe.Joshua B.

After years of attending back-to-school nights and parent-teacher conferences, mothers and fathers of College juniors congregated in Cambridge this past weekend for an occasion that, for many, represented the last explicitly “for parents” event of their son or daughter’s childhood.They came for Junior Parents Weekend—two days of House Masters’ receptions, faculty presentations, student performances, dinners out in the Square, and, in some cases, a chance to flex parental muscle.For the mother of Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14, the weekend presented a usually impossible opportunity to directly intervene in her daughter’s love life.“My mom saw a boy who she thought was really attractive, so she got pictures of him on her phone and told me that I need to find him,” Acevedo said, adding that she found the incident more amusing than embarrassing.Many parents said they enjoyed the opportunity to experience a day in the collegiate life of their child.
For Julianne La Smith, the mother of Megan M. Quintero ’14, that meant going to Starbucks, Quintero’s dorm room in Kirkland House, a tea at Quintero’s sorority, and a performance of the LowKeys.For still other parents, the weekend offered a chance to get to know their child’s previously mysterious college friends.Kristen J. Wraith ’14 said the meeting between her mother and her friends went well. Her mother, Wraith said, brought with her “a really good New York accent, which a lot of my friends were excited to hear.”Wraith added that her mother “tries really hard not to embarrass me, and she does a pretty good job of it.”The official events of the weekend, highlighted by a welcome address delivered by University President Drew G. Faust in Sanders Theatre, were coordinated by the Office of Student Life in collaboration with the Crimson Key Society.Acevedo’s parents attended a career panel at the Office of Career Services, which Acevedo said led to a productive conversation about her future.“[My parents] absolutely loved it. They were very concerned about me having my life together, and the discussion at OCS really reinforced things I’ve been saying to them and made them feel more confident about it,” she said.But despite the OSL programming, some bucked the trend and opted to explore Harvard and the Boston area on their own.“We looked at some of the [official] stuff, but my mom said she kind of wanted to come to see me and be my friend,” said Allison Gofman ’14, who took her mother to a Hyperion Shakespeare scene recital and to see the glass flowers at the Natural History Museum.—Staff writer Yen H.

It all came down to the wire. Tied at 13-13 in the match and 4-4 in the bout, freshman Jerry Chang was faced with overcoming his brother, Penn sophomore Jason Chang, in foil to give the Harvard men’s fencing team sole possession of the conference title at the Ivy Round-Robins this weekend at Gordon Indoor Track.The Crimson (13-5, 5-0 Ivy) competed with five Ancient Eight foes on Saturday and Sunday, emerging undefeated and untied.Jerry Chang jumped out to an early lead, 4-2, but his brother was able to close in and force a tie-breaking battle.“Jerry is a freshman and his brother is a sophomore,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “Jerry has a bit more experience and his results were really tremendous. His brother on the other hand, was also moving well, and he had already gone through this experience before so I think things were fairly even going into the bout.”Jerry Chang fought for the crucial touch, earning the final point to win the bout and push the match in Harvard’s favor, 14-13, enabling his team to grab its seventh Ivy crown in program history.
“He was fortunate to come out on top in the end,” Brand said. “It was quite a dramatic ending to say the least.”For his performance in the bout, and through the entire season, Chang was one of three members of the team to earn an All-Ivy nod. The rookie was joined by fellow freshman Michael Woo and sophomore Brian Kaneshige, also foilists.The Crimson opened the weekend with a swift takedown of Yale. Harvard fencers swept foil, 9-0, but dropped three bouts each in saber and epee.Next up, against Columbia, the Crimson dropped two events, saber and epee to the Lions, yet posted a resounding defeat in foil, 8-1, that allowed the team to take the match, 15-12. The loss, which was dealt to Jerry Chang, was the sole contest that the foil squad, which won 17 bouts, dropped through the first day of competition.Sophomore Alexander Ryjik was blanked by his three Columbia opponents, while junior Eric Arzoian and senior Thomas Kolasa dropped one and two bouts, respectively. In saber, Lions fencer Alen Hadzic broke a tie with junior Michael Raynis to edge the Crimson in the event, 5-4.The second day of the event saw the Harvard squad fight to stay on top of the standings.On Sunday, the Crimson started the day by winning all three events against Brown. The team earned seven wins in the saber and six in the foil and epee, knocking off the Bears, 19-8.To clinch a share of the title, Harvard bested Princeton, 16-11, with a wide margin of victory in saber, 8-1, a close, 5-4, win in foil and a loss in epée, 3-6.“Princeton is regarded as our biggest rival in fencing,” Kaneshige said. “All the wins this weekend were equally as important and equally as memorable.”The Crimson faced the Quakers with full possession of the title on the line. Harvard dropped the saber, 7-2, with Kolasa and Ryjik picking up the sole wins in the weapon.

A goal from freshman attackman Devin Dwyer tied up the score, 3-3, in the opening of the third quarter, bringing Harvard men’s lacrosse (1-2) back into its game against Hofstra (3-1) on Saturday in Hempstead, N.Y.But the Crimson failed to tally another point until the final minutes while the Pride netted seven consecutive goals to secure the win, 10-5.Hofstra’s sophomore midfielder Mike Malave opened the scoring with an unassisted goal in the second minute of the match.The goal was the lone point of the first quarter, but the start of a three-goal streak for the Pride heading into the second frame.Hofstra capitalized on a man-up situation in the opening minute of the second quarter when junior midfielder Drew Coholan scored off an assist from freshman attackman Sam Llinares to bring the score to 2-0. An unassisted goal from junior attackman Torin Varn extended the Pride lead to three goals.
Hofstra’s junior ended up completing  a hat trick in the contest to lead all scorers.“We had a rough day shooting,” Dwyer said. “The goalie made a couple good saves…but we are really going to be working on our shooting every day.”Harvard finally put points up on the scoreboard when junior attackman Danny Eipp found the back of the net after an unassisted drive toward goal. The Crimson offense rallied and recorded two more points in the next ten minutes, the first of which came from senior midfielder Alex White, who handled an assist from Eipp in the 12th minute of the second frame.“At the beginning of the game, we made some great stops on defense,” captain Jason Gonos said. “I think we were playing some of the best defense we’ve played all year. During halftime, we felt pretty good about our position because they scored the first goal but we felt like we made some good stops on defense, and on offense we were putting up some goals. We had shown that we could play with them and we could definitely beat them, and I still believe we can beat them, but they definitely got the best of us [today].”Dwyer leveled the score in the first minute of play in the third quarter, but the Pride answered with seven consecutive goals to hold a comfortable lead for the remainder of the match.“We really just needed to get possession of the ball,” Dwyer said. “We didn’t really get that much possession. They were doing a good job on defense, but once we got the ball we knew we had to slow it down a little, get the ball around, and just play our game.”Varn finished off his hat trick with two back-to-back goals in the fifth and tenth minutes of the third frame. Coholan chipped in another goal, and Llinares executed an unassisted goal in the final 14 seconds of the frame, while the Pride was a man down.“We had a pretty solid first and second quarter, and then in the third quarter we kind of unraveled a little bit,” Gonos said. “They started scoring some goals, they went on a little run, and we really just kind of couldn’t stop it. It kind of seemed like we were compiling errors on the offensive and defensive side, so basically they went on that run and we couldn’t really stop it.”After two more man-up goals, Hofstra finished the game going three of six in extra-man situations, while Harvard failed to find the net in each of its four opportunities.In the closing eight minutes, Dwyer pocketed a goal and sent an assist to Eipp who netted the final point of the contest, bringing the final score to 10-5.“We are going to continue working on all the little things like groundballs, shooting, and watching film and learning from what we did wrong to get better,” Dwyer said.Dwyer and Eipp tallied the most offensive points—three each—in the matchup while junior attackman Peter Schwartz and White led the Crimson in turnovers forced, creating four and three, respectively.“We need to work on hitting our shots,” Gonos said. “Defensively, we need to make those stops when [our opponents] go on those runs. We need to make sure that we do all the little things right and come up big against those runs to get some momentum our way.”—Staff writer Kelley Guinn McArtor can be reached at kelleyguinnmcartor@college.harvard.edu.

It was a sweet homecoming for the Harvard men’s tennis team, which celebrated its first home match in a month this weekend by capturing victories in each of its three matches. In a doubleheader on Sunday, the Crimson scored two decisive wins, taking down Louisville (8-6), 4-3, in the morning and thrashing Boston University (4-2), 6-1, in the afternoon at the Murr Center.On Saturday, Harvard opened up the weekend with a 4-3 victory over Indiana (6-7). The No. 23 Crimson’s victories this weekend improved the team’s record to 9-4 on the season as the team has won seven of its last eight matches.“We were very happy to come away with three wins on the weekend,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “It was a solid showing by everyone. It’s always a good weekend when we’re tested and are able to come through.”HARVARD 6, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 1On Sunday afternoon, Harvard was firmly in control against the Terriers despite sporting a different lineup than normal due to the weekend’s heavy workload.
In the early going, the Crimson cruised to the doubles point. The team of senior co-captain Andy Nguyen and freshman Nicky Hu, playing a spot up at No. 1, scored an 8-2 victory, and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and freshman Kelvin Lam cruised, 8-0.  Sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Conor Haughey, playing on the third court, also took home a win, 8-5.It came just as easy for Harvard in singles. Chaudhuri, playing at No. 1, beat the Terriers’ Josh Friedman 6-1, 6-0, and sophomore Henry Steer won by the same score. Junior Brandon Seaver, playing at No. 6, was the only Crimson player to go down, as freshmen Lam and Haughey, plus Andy Nguyen, all won to provide the final 6-1 score.“Every day, at every position, we put ourselves in an opportunity to win,” Chaudhuri said. “On different days, different people will pull it out, which makes us a very tough team to beat.”HARVARD 4, LOUISVILLE 3On Sunday morning, Harvard continued its winning ways and knack for winning close matches by defeating the Cardinals, 4-3.As has been the case in many of the team’s matches this season, the match swung on the doubles point. On the first court, MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen beat Louisville’s top squad, 8-5. Although Andy Nguyen and Hu fell in a hard-fought 9-7 battle, Steinroeder and Lam made up for the defeat at No. 3, beating the Cardinals’ Austin Siegel and Michael Lippens, 9-7, for the doubles point.In singles, Hu earned a straight-set victory at No. 5, but Steer fell on the sixth court and Andy Nguyen lost in straight sets to tie the match at 2-2.Even though Denis Nguyen lost a three-setter at No. 1, sophomores Chaudhuri and Steinroeder came through for the Crimson. Steinroeder defeated Louisville’s Chris Simich, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, and Chaudhuri clinched the match for Harvard with a 6-4, 6-2 victory at No. 2.Steinroeder said the team’s experience helps give it confidence in close matches.“We’ve all been in this situation before, and in close matches we trust our teammates to pull it out for us,” he said. “Our guys seem to just find a way to win. To have this mental edge when the matches are all so close really helps.”HARVARD 4, INDIANA 3In Saturday’s action, Steinroeder and Lam scored an 8-4 win to give the Crimson an early head start. But the Hoosiers would quickly fight back, taking down the first team of MacMaster and Denis Nguyen, 8-5. Hu and Andy Nguyen fought back from down a break to capture their match, 8-6, and secure the doubles point for Harvard.Andy Nguyen also took control in singles, where he scored a 6-4, 6-3 win at No. 4 to give the Crimson a 2-0 match lead. He is now 7-1 in dual matches on the fourth court this season.But Indiana was ahead in other matches, and took straight-set victories over Chaudhuri at No. 2 and Steinroeder at No. 3 to even that match at 2-2. The match looked in doubt for the Crimson after Denis Nguyen dropped his second set, 1-6, but he came back to win the third set, 6-3. Hu, playing at No. 5, clinched the match for Harvard with a comeback 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 win.—Staff writer Justin C. Wong can be reached at justinwong@college.harvard.edu.

Myanmar has made remarkable progress in the past few years with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, party leader of the Burmese National League for Democracy, and the agreement of rebel group Karen National Union to end a half-century long civil conflict. These, plus the abolishment of media censorship, make it undeniable that the country is heading for a definitive turn-around.Following Myanmar’s favorable reforms, this past July the U.S. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/asia/us-sanctions-on-myanmar-formally-eased.html?_r=0"">loosened sanctions on the country and is continuing to do so. However, for some like leader Suu Kyi, removing only a portion of the sanctions is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/world/asia/myanmars-opposition-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-begins-visit-to-us.html"">insufficient to further the country’s progress. While the successes the country has celebrated reflect the commendable strides it has made towards a democracy, Myanmar’s current state still mirrors much of the country’s violent history. Considering the conflicts within the Kachin State and against the Rohingya, the international community must not make further moves to ease sanctions and should instead use newly formed diplomatic relations to work towards remedying centuries of the violence that has plagued this nation.Though the Burmese military and the Kachin Independent Army reached a <a href=""http://www.kachinland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=45&amp;layout=blog&amp;Itemid=75"">ceasefire agreement in 1994, this did little to change the political climate within the Kachin region. The Burmese government, however, continued its repressive practices by <a href=""http://cnsnews.com/news/article/myanmar-postpones-election-restive-north"">barring Kachin leaders from running for political office in 2010 and postponing elections in Kachin constituencies. In July 2011, the army <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/23/world/asia/myanmar-burma-kachin-conflict/index.html?iref=allsearch"">reportedly launched a major “military offensive,” thereby putting a definitive end to the already loosely-followed peace agreement. This violence against the Kachin continued into this year with the Myanmar military launching <a href=""http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/20131108109573277.html"">airstrikes beginning on Christmas Eve, an act that could be perceived as religious intolerance against a primarily Christian group living in a primarily Buddhist nation.The Myanmar government <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/world/asia/cease-fire-in-myanmar-with-kachin-rebels-fails-to-take-hold.html?_r=1&amp;"">declared yet another unilateral cease-fire this January, only to instigate more skirmishes days later. Though the government may argue that their rekindling of hostilities were done out of self-defense, it cannot deny that it has actively sought out conflict not only with the Kachin but also with other groups such as the Rohingya while doing little to remedy these national conflicts it has perpetrated.Though the Burmese have attempted to expel the Rohingya from their territory for <a href=""http://twocircles.net/2012jul29/rohingya_muslims_brief_history_persecution.html"">centuries by implementing harsh social policies against the group, in the past few decades alone this group has been subjected to several Myanmar-led anti-Rohingya campaigns. In 1982, Burma passed its <a href=""http://www.nationalityforall.org/burma-myanmar"">Citizenship Law that unjustly rendered the Rohingya people “foreign” occupants. Due to the people’s “alien” <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7872635.stm"">status, they are not only unable to travel outside of the country, but they also are required to obtain permission to get married. In addition, Rohingya men are subject to forced labor which consists of working once a week on government tasks and one night on sentry duty.
These punishments not only dehumanize and stifle Rohingya freedom but also limit the duration and location of Rohingya men’s work, perpetually pushing them further down the economic ladder. With these restrictions, the Rohingya often have little means to escape the region, regretfully leaving them to face the incessant violence and corruption of Burmese forces.Considering President Obama’s visit to Myanmar this past November and Aung San Suu Kyi’s trip to the U.S. this September, it is evident that a channel of communication exists between the two countries. Nonetheless, Suu Kyi’s hopes of lifting sanctions for the purpose of removing the country from economic isolation and the hopes of trade and investment are severely misguided. First, the U.S. has already granted an <a href=""http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2012/11/24/obama-announces-aid-package-to-myanmar/"">aid package of $170 million and the World Bank recently <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20176841"">approved an $80 million grant to help the country combat its humanitarian crisis.While these sources of funding may not be as sustainable as trade, removing all sanctions will not solve the persistent problem of human rights violations, and the U.S., along with other countries, cannot cast these issues aside simply out of a self-interested aim to invest. In fact, some currently enforced trade bans such as the 2008 U.S. move to ban the trade of jades and rubies, are actually <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1312382/The-curse-blood-rubies-Inside-Burmas-brutal-gem-trade.html"">said to combat the forced labor, rape, and ethnic cleansing linked to the industries.The actions we have seen from Myanmar would likely be <a href=""http://www2.icc-cpi.int/NetApp/App/MCMSTemplates/Index.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7BD788E44D-E292-46A1-89CC-D03637A52766%7D&amp;NRORIGINALURL=/Menus/ICC/About+the+Court/Frequently+asked+Questions/&amp;NRCACHEHINT=Guest%23id_12"">described by the U.N. as crimes against humanity, which falls under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.  In 2005, each UN member state <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/responsibility.shtml"">signed the “Responsibility to Protect” document, affirming that they would protect those who live within the country’s border, and intervene if this duty were not upheld. Myanmar has time and again proven that it cannot and essentially refuses to protect its people as the country itself is the perpetrator. It is for this reason that the international community must now act not by targeting economic gain but rather by working towards promoting and gaining both peace and human rights for these conflict-ridden groups.In light of the U.S. aim to build stronger diplomatic relations with Myanmar, it must first prioritize eliminating the violent discord in the Kachin and Rakhine regions. Although Burma’s economic prospects may be alluring to the international community, the U.S. cannot free Myanmar of its restrictions until the Burmese government makes a deliberate effort to put an end to its inhuman, violent, and undemocratic practices.Dina M. Perez ’15 is a classics concentrator in Leverett House.

Narwhals, the Arctic whales known for their long unicorn-like tusks, could be one of the first victims of climate change, science writer Todd B. McLeish said during a well-attended lecture Saturday.Speaking at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, McLeish, a publicist for the University of Rhode Island, discussed the future of the narwhal population as detailed in his recent book, “Narwhals: Arctic Whales in a Melting World.”Because the narwhal’s diet includes only a few different types of fish and it prefers a narrow and specific habitat, scientists expect that it will be difficult for the mammals to survive the shrinking ice caps and evolving natural environment brought on by climate change, McLeish said.Warmer waters could also lead to a higher number of killer whales, the narwhals’ chief predator. As the ice melts, commercial fishing and oil exploration will likely expand, resulting in more competition for the narwhal’s food sources and increased disturbances to their habitat.Although the population is currently stable, McLeish said “fifty or a hundred years certainly seem like timeframes when there will likely be some serious red flags.”
McLeish said the narwhal’s long and storied history was what first drew him to the study of the species. At the lecture, he brought up the narwhal’s role in perpetuating age-old unicorn mythology. The marine mammals have long been compared to the mythical horned-creatures, dating back to the Middle Ages, when narwhal tusks harvested from the Arctic were sold in Europe as “unicorn horns.”According to McLeish, back then widespread belief in the magical healing powers of the tusks led to their being valued higher than gold. European royalty made drinking cups out of narwhal tusks that they believed counteracted poison. Items of royal furniture like a Danish Coronation Throne were fashioned from the tusks. The Catholic Church even ground them into a powder that it added to sacramental wine to help heal parishioners.Caitlin E. Andrews ’16 said she most enjoyed McLeish’s “stories about his expeditions,” such as his tale of camping for multiple weeks in Greenland during the season when the country experiences 24 hours of sunlight a day.

Media mogul and billionaire philanthropist Oprah Winfrey will speak at Harvard’s 362nd Commencement in May, the University announced Monday.“Oprah’s journey from her grandmother’s Mississippi farm to becoming one of the world’s most admired women is one of the great American success stories,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “She has used her extraordinary influence and reach as a force for good in the world, with a constant focus on the importance of educational opportunity and the virtues of serving others.”Winfrey is best known for her nationally syndicated talk show, “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” which ended its 25-season run in 2011. The Emmy Award-winning show <a href=""http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/The-Oprah-Winfrey-Show-by-the-Numbers-Oprah-Show-Statistics"">was broadcasted in 145 countries and reached more than 40 million viewers per week in the United States alone. The popularity of the series, which featured a total of about 28,000 guests ranging from Hollywood celebrities to American presidents, brought her into the international spotlight.Along with her highly successful show, Winfrey—the first African-American woman billionaire—has done extensive philanthropic work, with a focus on women’s education in developing countries. Oprah’s Angel Network, a charity that Winfrey founded in 1998, has <a href=""http://www.oprah.com/angelnetwork/The-History-of-Oprahs-Angel-Network/12"">raised more than $70 million and built <a href=""http://www.oprah.com/angelnetwork/The-History-of-Oprahs-Angel-Network/5"">more than 50 schools in 13 countries around the world, according to Winfrey’s website. Winfrey has also worked to increase the safety of children, pushing for the creation of a national database of convicted child abusers through the 1993 National Child Protection Act, also known as the “Oprah Bill.”Winfrey will speak during the Afternoon Exercises of Commencement, which will take place on May 30 at Tercentenary Theater in Harvard Yard. In the past, the University has hosted Commencement Day speakers from a wide range of backgrounds, including prominent world leaders like <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/in-commencement-address-annan-urges-global/"">Kofi A. Annan and business innovators like <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/6/7/gates-delivers-speech-to-graduating-class/"">Bill Gates.
Winfrey herself has delivered numerous commencement addresses at universities around the country, including Duke University and Stanford University.

While this year’s Academy Awards summarized another successful year in film for millions of viewers from around the world, this year’s nominees were unfolding a different spectacle. Although “Argo” <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-oscars-2013-academy-awards-20130224,0,648894.story"">took the top prize, the consolation of being nominated for Best Picture still remains quite the accolade for the respective artists, particularly for the brains behind “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” By acknowledging the accomplishments of low-budget filmmakers, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences fosters a stable environment and broadcasts the value of smaller productions in Hollywood.Considering the simple fact that Hollywood has traditionally been an incredibly profitable industry, loading up a film with explosive special effects, marketable A-list talent, and a nationwide advertising campaign tends to correlate with accessibility to a vast audience. For films destined for the Red Carpet like “Argo” and “Lincoln,” this national viewership is key to attaining the necessary critical acclaim and box-office numbers to achieve a monstrous list of nominations.But for films like “Beast of the Southern Wild,” this is simply not the case. The winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000631/2012"">2012 Sundance Film Festival, “Beasts” had its run on the independent film circuit, specifically with art house-oriented theatres in LA and New York. For a film like “Beasts” to achieve any sort of award consideration, it must rely on word of mouth and incredible reviews, a much more daunting task. And most of the time, these independent films fail to garner the necessary momentum to make it into the expanded Best Picture category.Although director Benh Zeitlin has enough knowledge of the industry to know that “Beasts” did not pose a serious threat to winning the Oscar, the nomination itself is nearly as large an award. When the Academy recognizes films as small as “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which had a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125435/?ref_=sr_1"">$1.8 million budget, the Academy is essentially recognizing the fact that in today’s film industry, it does not necessarily take the backing of a major studio to produce an endearing and financially successful film.Traditionally, the film festival circuit has been the only key outlet for the success of an independent film. Particularly for higher-key festivals like Sundance, the goal does not particularly pertain to earning awards but rather to picking up a distributor for theatre release. At Sundance, Fox Searchlight <a href=""http://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00047215.html"">acquired the rights to “Beasts” and prepped it for a June 27th release. Weinstein Co. <a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/03/5156591/fruitvale-filmmaker-has-sacramento.html"">purchased this year’s <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000631/2013"">Grand Jury Prize Winner, “Fruitvale,” a dramatic rendition of the <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/BART-shooting-captured-on-video-3177850.php"">2009 Oakland shooting of Oscar Grant, for the meager sum of $2 million.
However, there seems to be a more recent trend rippling through Hollywood that has championed the potential profit margin of low-budget pictures. Considering the current state of the nation’s economy, studios tend to avoid rushing to production high-budget films that contain a particular bit of risk in potential box office returns. Distribution companies are now, more than ever, seeking out production companies that can consistently guarantee positive returns with quality low-budget features that have some sort of marketability. No one better epitomizes this than up-and-coming producer Jason Blum and his work for the horror genre with Blumhouse Productions.Until 2000, Blum <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089658/?ref_=fn_al_nm_5"">worked as the co-head of Acquisitions and co-Productions department at Miramax, where his primary specialty was assessing the financial potential of films. Now, he stands as the multi-millionaire CEO of Blumhouse Productions, which has the lucrative titles of “<a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=paranormalactivity.htm"">Paranormal Activity,” “<a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=insidious.htm"">Insidious,” and “<a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sinister.htm"">Sinister,” all three of which grossed at least 2500% of their initial budgets. Blum is currently attempting to branch out to other genres with the promise of producing quality films with lower budgets and high returns. Even last weekend’s release of “Dark Skies,” one of Blumhouse Production’s underperforming pictures, <a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=darkskies.htm"">generated $8.85 million in its opening weekend with a budget of $3.5 million.The days of the importance of featuring prominent A-listers with astronomical salaries are not necessarily over, but that model is definitely battling stiff competition. Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Sylvester Stallone saw this subtle transformation first hand with the crash and burn of both their action flicks “<a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=laststand.htm"">The Last Stand” and “<a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bullettothehead.htm"">Bullet to the Head.” Although prominent superhero flicks will still generate hundreds of millions of dollars, low-budget works that retain the art of film and the quality of story can still be appreciated.As the Academy continues to recognize the achievements of these smaller productions, there seems to be some hope for film as studios seek out safer and safer investments. While old ideas are recycled, remade and then made into sequels time and time again, film enthusiasts derive power from the accomplishments of smaller productions. Congratulations to the accomplishments of Ben Zeitlin and “Beasts of Southern Wild” for earning a Best Picture nomination and for championing the plethora of exemplary independent films in 2012.Connor P. McKnight ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Grays Hall.

This weekend, when students climbed aboard Melvin Washington, Jr.’s evening shuttle bus that travels back and forth between the Yard and the Quad, they were not greeted by the customary strobe lights and thudding music, but rather an entirely party-less shuttle.The bus, typically dubbed “the party shuttle,” has become an informal institution at the College—a weekend staple for many Quad residents. When the shuttle conspicuously did not operate this past weekend, students took notice.In one of many emails sent over an email list for Currier House students, Wesley A. Gordon ’13 encouraged residents to protest the closing of the party shuttle by contacting Campus Services to express their discontent.In the message, Gordon wrote that he had spoken with Washington about the closure of the party shuttle this weekend. Gordon declined to comment on the email.Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement to The Crimson Wednesday that “there is currently no plan to eliminate or reconfigure the lights and music on the late night bus,” but that occasionally Transportation Services assesses the safety of its fleet.
“To that end, they are currently looking at this bus, as they periodically do, to ensure that the party elements as currently configured don’t pose any safety concerns,” Neal wrote.Neal did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday on whether or not the party shuttle ran this past weekend.Rumors about the possible closure of the party shuttle have concerned students at the College.“I think it’s something people enjoy,” Rodriguez S. Roberts ’15 said. He said he would be “disappointed” if the shuttle was shut down.Other students praised Washington and his attempt to improve the quality of student life with a party on wheels.“The level of dedication Melvin brings to the job is unprecedented,” Nathaniel W. Donahue ’15 said. “He cares a lot about making sure people take the shuttle and making sure people get where they need to.”Washington began operating the party shuttle in 2009 in hopes that the addition of entertainment—fun music and lighting—might entice students to take the bus rather than walk to and from the Quad.“If you bring in some excitement the students will follow,” he said. “They seem to really enjoy it.”Washington added that he believes Harvard students deserve to have some fun on the weekends.“They need something after all the stuff they go through during the week,” he said.—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

Following months of budget battles on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama signed off on legislation Friday night to automatically reduce government spending, unleashing an unprecedented wave of cuts to funding sources that have long supported Harvard’s researchers and scientists.The budget cuts—collectively known as sequestration—are projected to amount to $85 billion this fiscal year alone and $1.2 trillion over the coming decade. Harvard <a href=""http://vpf-web.harvard.edu/annualfinancial/pdfs/2012fullreport.pdf"">received over $650 million from Washington during the last complete fiscal year, meaning that researchers across the University will have to cope with the impact of sharply constricted federal funding in the form of both<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/25/university-braces-spending-cuts/""> decreased availability and reduced size of federal research grants.“The acceleration of discovery in so many fields makes this an unrivaled era in its promise for new understanding and human betterment,” said University President Drew G. Faust in a statement to The Crimson. “Yet today—at a time when our desire to ask fundamental questions is matched by our ability to answer them—these cuts threaten to undermine our ability to carry on the basic research that leads us to new frontiers of knowledge and boosts American competitiveness.”The exact distribution of the spending cuts within specific government programs remain uncertain. But according to <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/legislative_reports/fy13ombjcsequestrationreport.pdf"">a report from the Office of Management and Budget, Harvard’s top two sources of research funding—the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation—are slated to face cuts of about 5 percent each. In expectation of the sequester, the NIH announced last year that it would withhold 10 percent of its promised award amount for all grants.The government has ordered Harvard’s third top funding source, the Department of Defense, to slash spending by about 7.9 percent.
The cuts come after approximately 10 years of flattened levels of federal funding and will curtail sponsorship for ongoing as well as future research projects. Professors and scientists worry that bleak prospects for funding may both deter budding researchers from entering the field and make foreign research hubs more attractive.To argue against funding cuts, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/1/faust-research-funding-cuts/"">Faust traveled to Washington this past week to meet with members of the executive department and prominent congressional representatives from both sides of the aisle. In her conversations, she emphasized the ability of scientific discovery to propel knowledge and economic growth forward.“As I said in my meetings with lawmakers in Washington this past week, it would be worse than a tragedy to waste this moment full of promise,” Faust said in the statement. “It is our responsibility to make sure that Congress re-prioritizes investment in science as soon as possible.”The future of federal funding remains uncertain, as some government representatives have indicated that they may work to retroactively reverse portions of the sequester, while other lawmakers view the across-the-board budget cuts as a permanent measure.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nikitakansra@college.harvard.edu.

The Harvard Square Business Association has partnered with Cambridge-based technology start-up Leaf Holdings, Inc. to begin collecting in-store donations this month to help the homeless, the HSBA announced last Friday.Customers can make credit card donations from $1 to $100 using tablets available in 15 Harvard Square businesses, including Black Ink, Brattle Square Florist, Concepts, The World’s Only Curious George Store, Market in the Square, Tistik, and The Tannery, according to Friday’s announcement. The tablets were designed and donated by Leaf Holdings.“By working with HSBA and donating LeafPresenter tablets to Harvard Square businesses, we can make a real impact in our local community,” said Leaf CEO and founder Aron Schwarzkopf in the press release.Providing a convenient alternative to directly donating spare money, the funds raised from the new system will be directed towards local charities, including Youth on Fire, Harvard Square Churches Meals Program, On The Rise, Bread and Jams Self Advocacy Center, CASPAR, Spare Change News, and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.“I’m really an advocate of providing as many different types of opportunities for people to donate to different causes so they can do what they feel most comfortable with,” said Kelly A. Sullivan ’14, administrative director at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
She said donations from the Leaf tablets will help the shelter cover a variety of expenses, such as purchasing socks and underwear for its guests.Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the HSBA, presented the initiative at the organization’s annual meeting on March 1. At the gathering she recognized the concerns raised by some businesses over panhandling that has happened in front of Harvard Square stores and restaurants in the past, but emphasized the common desire to work with the homeless rather than force them out.“We can’t shoo away people, nor do we want to. This is an authentic urban space where everyone is welcome,” she said.Ayala Livny, the program manager at Youth on Fire—a drop-in center for homeless youth—echoed Jillson’s remarks. She said she thinks the new initiative is a testament to the progressive and compassionate culture of Harvard Square.“Most business districts try to get homeless folks out as quickly as they can,” Livny said. “Very few districts in the country, let alone the world, would actually be supportive of organizations working with homeless individuals.”—Staff writer Nikki D.

</h2>
Maybe it's for your SPU requirement, maybe you just drunkenly ended up in the Bio-Labs, or maybe you're like me, and you just wanted to play with chemicals. Regardless of the reason, it's happened—you're are in a lab class. Your strong verbal skills and College Board approved vocabulary won't help you here. As I like to say, science is hard. But luckily I have some tips that will make lab a little easier for us humanities concentrators.<!--more-->1. Don't CryDon't do it; it's a waste of waterproof mascara. It's not that the hard sciences are heartless; it's just that my tears, which would have moved my government TF, did nothing to move up my lab grade.2. F=MA
It is the golden rule of the science classes, what you say when you have no idea what the polarity a calcium molecule is or why your test tube is on fire. This magic equation will guarantee you partial credit at the very least. Trust me—this is how I passed AP Physics and my driver's test.3. Suck UpNot to your TF, but to that smart kid that sits next to you. Buy her Insomnia cookies, compliment her haircut, and seduce her with your lab goggles. This way, when it comes to choosing a lab partner, or blaming that toxic chemical spill on the kid behind you, you'll have someone smart on your side. If you feel guilty about mooching too much and want a more symbiotic relationship (science term!), give back to the partnership by coming up with a good lab group nickname or sharing your knowledge of F=MA.

Members of the Ward 21 Democratic Party Committee, which represents residents of the Allston, Brighton, and Fenway neighborhoods, voted unanimously Saturday morning to endorse U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of Malden in his primary battle against U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston.Markey and Lynch, as well as three Republicans, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat vacated Feb. 1 by recently appointed Secretary of State John F. Kerry.Saturday’s caucus meeting took place at the Brighton Branch of the Boston Public Library and was attended by just 12 eligible voters. To be eligible, voters must be registered Democrats and residents of the Ward 21 polling district and must attend three meetings of the committee within a year.State Senator Will N. Brownsberger ’78 represented the Markey campaign, and spoke extensively about Markey’s experience authoring, sponsoring, and supporting climate change legislation in Congress.Brownsberger, who expressed his intention to run for Markey’s seat should it be vacated, also referenced Markey’s support of abortion rights in Congress in contrast to Lynch’s more socially conservative position on the issue. While<a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/02/05/lynch-long-pro-life-antiabortion-legislator-says-supports-roe-wade/TvoPjNf90snncEUckQXBRK/story.html""> Lynch has historically described himself as an antiabortion Democrat and has voted to restrict access to abortion more often than not in Congress, he has said in recent weeks that he does not support the overturning of the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade.
“You have a candidate who for many years has been a strong advocate of a woman’s right to choose, and a candidate [Lynch] who, until recently, has not,” Brownsberger said.Brownsberger was not countered by a surrogate from the Lynch campaign. Because no representative from the Lynch campaign attended the meeting, the South Boston congressman was left without a voice before the caucus and without enough support to even qualify for the endorsement ballot. As a result, Markey’s endorsement was decided by an up-or-down vote.At the meeting, voters voiced excitement about working for Markey, drawing parallels between the campaign ahead and their experiences canvassing for former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren during her successful U.S. Senate campaign last year. The committee discussed the coordination of voter-registration efforts for the coming campaign, among other things.In remarks after the endorsement vote, local committee chair Lauren Mattison alluded to the popularly held sentiment that in the heavily blue Commonwealth, whoever wins the Democratic nomination will be heavily favored against any of the three Republican contenders—former U.S. Navy Seal Gabriel E. Gomez, former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan, and State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow—vying for their party’s nomination.“It seems like the [Democratic] primary might be the more competitive election,” Mattison said. “Now that we’ve made an endorsement, we can start to do things for Ed Markey.”But Boston City Councilor At-Large Felix G. Arroyo, who did not vote, urged the group not to color the open Senate seat blue just yet.“Remember, Scott Brown wasn’t supposed to win, until he did,” said Arroyo, referring to the former Republican congressman who in 2010 beat Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley in a special election following the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy ‘54-’56.Party primaries will be held on April 30, and the special election for the senate seat is scheduled for June 25. Kerry’s seat is being filled on an interim basis by William “Mo” Cowan, a lawyer and former chief of staff for Mass. Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78.—Staff writer Matthew Q.

During the weekend’s Ivy Round Robin championships, the Harvard women’s fencing team went 4-2, finishing in third place. At the championships, held at Harvard’s Gordon Indoor Track, the team won two of three matches both days. Princeton walked away with the title, going 6-0 and defeating Harvard, 19-8. Senior fencer Felicia Sun led the team in winning the epee event against the Tigers, 5-4, but the Crimson lost the saber and foil events decisively, 8-1 and 7-2, respectively.“Our biggest rivals this weekend were definitely Columbia and Princeton,” Sun said. “All three of us had really amazing bouts against [Princeton fencer] Cat Bolen. She’s on the world team and she’s pretty frightening, but we all fenced [well] against her. I think that really shifted the Princeton team’s confidence and I think that’s what enabled us to come out on top.”Sun went 9-5 on the weekend, garnering an All-Ancient Eight second-team nod in the process. She was joined by women’s sabreur freshman Aliya Itzkowitz, while sophomore Emma Vaggo earned a place on the first-team all-conference squad by going 16-2 on the weekend.Sun said that it was key in the team’s performance that it knew who it was going to play. According to Sun, the familiarity that she had with her opponents was very important in helping the team prepare and shift its lineup to gain advantageous matchups.“I think our biggest strength is probably knowing what the matchups would be,” Sun said. “The people in the Ivy League are the people who are in the top tier in the nation, so I feel like many of us have either fenced them before or grown up fencing them all our lives. So what we were able to do was deliberately put people in that we thought would be good matches against certain fencers because we know their style.”
The Crimson, which ranks eighth in the nation, bracketed the loss to Princeton on Sunady with victories against Brown (17-10) and Penn (16-11). Vaggo said that the ability of the team to support each other was key.“I think we knew that it was going to be hard coming in,” Vaggo said. “I think we did well overall but we had some really close bouts that didn’t go our way. This weekend I think we worked really well together as a team supporting each other.”Vaggo also said that she was proud of the play of Itzkowitz and classmate Nina van Loon and that her performances were crucial in the team’s third-place finish.“We had two freshmen do really well this weekend, Aliya Itzkowitz and Nina van Loon,” Vaggo said. “They did a good job. They dealt with a lot of pressure with their first Ivies, but I think they did a great job and really helped the team.”Sun said that one of the challenges with the weekend was the lack of participation by the community in coming to the meet. Sun said that she often draws on energy from the crowd and was disappointed with the turnout.“One thing that could have been better is getting support from our friends, from the men’s team and coaches,” Sun said. “It felt like during the whole meet there [weren’t] really a lot of people. We had really close matches against Princeton and Columbia, and I feel like if we had a little more support then people would have been able to put in a lot more of their energy.”The tournament served as a warm-up for the regional tournament next Sunday, held in New York at St. John’s University.“Regionals is a tricky event because only two people per squad qualify for the NCAA’s and since Regionals is the NCAA qualifier, it’s really going to test our team’s strength,” Sun said. “It will be hard for our team unity because we are competing against each other but we also need to help each other. We want to be able to send two people per squad, but we’re really going to have to work a lot on mental toughness…knowing what to draw, what to fight for to perform at the same level as we practiced.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s lacrosse team was unable to open its Ivy League season on a high note as it fell to Cornell, 17-12, on Saturday afternoon at Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca.In the loss, freshmen attackers Audrey Todd and Alexis Nicolia combined for six goals, with three apiece, providing a positive light to an otherwise disappointing game.“I think our freshman class played well,” Nicolia said. “We all come from good high schools so we understand the pressure of college. I think we held our composure well. We don’t really play like freshmen who are nervous to do things.”Nicolia has now scored eight goals in two games for the Crimson (0-2, 0-1 Ivy).“I think that we’ve been making a bunch of little mistakes that are very fixable,” Nicolia said. “It’s fortunate that I was able to find the back of the net a couple times but I wish our team as a whole found the back of the net a little more.”
Todd also handed out two assists to total five points in the game. The rookie contributed two points in last week’s 18-13 loss at Stanford.“We have a strong freshman class,” captain Micaela Cyr said. “We have a bunch of freshmen starting on offense and defense. It’s a huge transition from the high school to college game of lacrosse. It’s more physical, it’s faster [but] they’ve done well. We all have things to work on given that we lost our first two games, but they’ve stepped up and done their part.”Cyr, a midfielder who snatched three ground balls and five draw controls, was the only other player from the Crimson to record a team-high five points, also scoring three goals and dishing out two assists.The No. 15 Big Red (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) jumped out to an early lead that Harvard was never able to recover from.Up 8-5 heading into the intermission, Cornell pushed the lead to seven, 13-6, by scoring five goals in the first nine minutes of play after the break. During the scoring spree, Big Red sophomore attacker Lindsay Toppe—who had a game-high nine points off four goals and five assists—connected with teammates Rachel Moody and Amanda D’Amico, who both found the back of the net. Toppe also scored a goal of her own at the start of the second half, assisted by Sarah Hefner.The Crimson answered with offensive action of its own. Cyr scored an unassisted goal before passing to Nicolia almost three minutes later, who sent the ball past Cornell goalie Courtney Gallagher. Both Gallagher and the Crimson goalies—senior Melanie Cook and sophomore Annie Meyjes—grabbed seven saves in net.Cyr followed up with a third unassisted goal to complete a hat trick and give Harvard its ninth point. The Big Red restored the seven-point advantage, 16-9, with a D’Amico shot.The Crimson closed the gap to four with unassisted goals by Todd and junior defender Chloe Soukas and Nicolia’s final tally. Cornell scored once more off a free-position shot with 7:17 left in the contest.Cornell was aided by a bevy of penalty opportunities. The Crimson committed 32 fouls through the contest to the Big Red’s 14 total errors. Cornell was awarded seven free-position shots, three of which the team converted into goals.“You always get hit or miss with the fouls,” Cyr said. “Sometimes you’re drawing the ball back when you’re down and you maybe get too aggressive. That got called against us in that sense but that’s something I think we’ll probably work on, just trying to get our body positioning there rather than going with a check.”Harvard did lead, however, in draw controls, 17 to 14. The Crimson previously struggled in gaining possessions against the Cardinals, trailing the opponent in draw controls, 21 to 12.“Last weekend we struggled a lot in the second half with draw controls so practice all last week we focused on getting off the line quickly and handling the ball when everyone’s clasping,” Nicolia said, “It’s great that it played out well in the game.”—Staff writer Cordelia F.

After starting Sunday down by 34 points to rival Princeton, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team could not complete the comeback at the Ivy Championship meet, finishing second in the Ancient Eight. Harvard finished nearly 200 points ahead of the third-place finisher, Columbia, despite taking home only one win on Sunday when freshman Kendall Crawford won the 200-yard backstroke. The win was one of two Crawford wins on the weekend, and it came with fellow swimmers freshman Danielle Lee placing fourth and senior Caroline Weaver finishing eighth.Coach Stephanie Wriede Morowski said that the team, which set program records in the 1,650 freestyle and the 100 freestyle, had started poorly on the first day of the competition but had done better than Princeton over the weekend.“I thought that the team did great,” Morowski said. “We didn’t get the win, but you can’t define a season by one championship meet. It was a very good team effort in losing to the champions. While Princeton was a better team, I think we outswam them the second two days after a shaky start. However, that’s sports, and we did a really good job overall.”Morowski said that what separated this Harvard team from past squads she had coached was the chemistry in the locker room. Although all the women on the team are very different, Morowski said that the myriad personalities meshed well together.“I think this team really believed in not only themselves but also in each other,” Morowski said. “You have 20 different personalities, and they found a way to come together. The way this team is, they are going to be great on any different day. It is stuff like a swimmer going to a diver and telling them that I believe in you. We have always had that on teams, but this team took it to a new level, and probably they think they are so different in terms of their personalities that they knew what they needed to do as a team.”
This was the 11th straight meet that the Crimson finished second to the Tigers. Harvard, which is ranked 22nd in the nation, came into the meet 7-0 against fellow Ivy League foes in dual meets but struggled out of the gate.The team won only one race on Thursday, with senior diver Brittany Powell taking home the top spot in the one-meter diving event, but bounced back Friday with nine top-five finishes, highlighted by a 200 medley relay win over Columbia. Junior Sara Li was a consistent force for the Crimson over the weekend, earning a new program record in the 50m freestyle with her 22.46 finish and winning the 200m freestyle the following day.“It was an awesome weekend on all fronts,” Li said. “The Ivy Championships are really cool, and we went in hoping to win it and although that didn’t happen, we stayed together and we showed incredible heart. I think this made us realize why we are proud to be a part of this team and to be part of Harvard. It was also very motivating for next year for a very young team. We are proud of how everybody supported each other this weekend.”Morowski said that the team got away from what had made it successful during the season on the first day of the meet but by the end of the meet was able to show the technical improvements they had made during the year.“I think that we have very good chemistry, and because [of that], they are able to relax and have fun out there,” Morowski said. “That was something that they forgot on the first day and then got back to again. Technically, I think they have gotten cleaner as the season went on, and every race they have been fixing technical little things that plagued them earlier in the season.”Li said that the team, which she described as very competitive and close, had an intense level of focus all season that led to most of its success.“This team is really special for sure,” Li said. “The strength of this team is really that we have strong fire in our heart. We had an unbelievable year; we have just rolled into every meet really strong, and basically at every meet we have swam well and it’s been awesome to have those successes and those championships.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Sometimes it just takes a turn of the calendar.After a February in which the Harvard women’s tennis team (4-3) struggled to field a full roster due to injuries and illnesses, it started off March on the right foot.In consecutive wins over Binghampton (3-6) and Boston College (5-1), the team dropped a total of two matchups as the now-healthy Crimson was able to put its full team on the court.“We played phenomenally this weekend,” co-captain Hideko Tachibana said. “Everyone [played as] one and energy was really high… There was no mercy. I’m really proud of how we competed this weekend.”HARVARD 4, BINGHAMTON 0
Against Binghampton, Harvard came out of the gates fast and never slowed up. Junior Natalie Blosser and freshman Hai-Li Kong finished off their line-three doubles opponents, 8-3, and Tachibana and fellow co-captain Kristin Norton gave the Crimson the doubles point with an 8-2 victory.In singles, the Crimson lost only six games in the three matches that they won, with freshman Amanda Lin taking home a 6-1, 6-1 victory at line three and Blosser and Tachibana scoring easy wins at lines six and one, respectively.Lin—who played both doubles and singles—and Norton were absent last weekend and during Harvard’s win over Boston College.“Amanda and Kristin are some of the more energetic people on our team, so its crucial to have them out on the court cheering us on,” Tachibana said. “It was great to have them back.”Kong concurred, saying that the strong doubles play of the pair helped stabilize the lineup during the match.“Healthy or not, Amanda and Kristin are always loud cheerleaders for us,” Kong said. “They always pump the rest of the team up with their funny and inspirational cheers. It definitely helped to have them back on the court, especially for doubles. Having them back was crucial in helping us clinch that doubles point.”Tachibana said that she was really proud of the team’s quick turnaround from the Friday victory to the match on Saturday. In Ivy League play, the team will play two matches a weekend against league competition and that turnaround, according to Tachibana, will be an incredibly important one to master.“In the Ivy League it will be just as competitive, and bouncing back is a good lesson to learn,” Tachibana said. “In the Ivy League you play two matches a weekend and if you have a loss you have to be able to play the next day and have one hundred percent out there. Being able to bounce back after tough losses is something we will be able to take into the Ivy season, if we need to.”HARVARD 5, BOSTON COLLEGE 2On Friday, Harvard started strong in doubles, with sophomore Sylvia Li and freshman Amanda Lin taking the line-two doubles, 8-4. But the Crimson could not pull out the two other doubles matches and lost the doubles point before roaring back in singles.

Ballroom dance is known for for its flashiness, but on Friday, more than just the ballroom dancers’ outfits will be in bright colors. The Harvard Ballroom Dance Team, a competitive ballroom dance team, will perform their annual showcase—this year entitled “Colorful”—in Lowell Lecture Hall.The team, founded in 1991, comprises Harvard undergraduate and graduate students. It hosts two annual collegiate ballroom competitions and promotes the social aspect of ballroom dancing. While they compete as a team, the dancers typically perform as couples in competitions and shows.While their showcase has been an annual affair, this year’s event will bring a new twist to the annual tradition. According to Ivo B. Baca ’13, the current team captain, this year the team is expanding  their typical solo dance format to add formations with multiple dancers to the showcase.“All performers have been given the rare opportunity to choreograph their own pieces, and this has really infused the process with a wonderful creative energy,” Baca says. Around 40 dancers will be performing in the show, which will feature six couples, each performing a full piece, from the team’s Rookie and Intermediate classes.The showcase offers a twist on the standard ballroom and Latin dances, which include the waltz, tango, Viennese waltz, foxtrot, quickstep, cha cha, samba, rumba, jive, and paso doble. To reflect the group’s unique personality, the dances will each be centered around a specific color.“This showcase is aiming to celebrate the vibrant and colorful nature of the Harvard Ballroom [Dance Team] through the lens of the art we all love—ballroom dance,” Baca says.Tickets are $7 and available at the Harvard Box Office or through members of the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team.

A benediction is a cry for divine help. It is an appropriate title for Kent Haruf’s new novel, given that the novel itself seems to cry out for creative inspiration. While it is very technically proficient and occasionally poignant, the author’s inability to avoid lapsing into threadbare clichés ultimately prevents “Benediction” from making a lasting impact.The relatively slim volume is brimming with folks badly in need of a pick-me-up. The premise of “Benediction” will feel familiar to anyone who has read a Kent Haruf novel. Like all of his works, it is set in Holt, CO, a tiny, fictitious mountain town where everyone knows everyone, and Denver seems a million miles away. The nucleus of “Benediction” is the Lewis house, where general store proprietor Dad Lewis is dying. The imminence of his demise is announced on page one. The novel proceeds to follow the lives of those close to Dad: his wife Mary, his middle-aged daughter Lorraine, his neighbors the Johnson women, his priest Lyle, and Lyle’s son. As Dad circles the proverbial drain, their stories revolve around his own. And while Dad may be the only one among them with a death sentence, each is unmistakably headed for a fall.The novel is written in third person, but it feels almost disingenuous to imply that the narrator is any sort of person at all: Haruf’s narration is remarkably bare. Truly, this is meant as a compliment. Eschewing poetical frills and abstractions, Haruf’s business is to paint a clear picture of what occurs, and he begins the novel starkly: “When the test came back the nurse called them into the examination room and when the doctor entered the room he just looked at them and asked them to sit down. They could tell by the look on his face where matters stood.” How characters feel about one another is expressed almost exclusively through their actions. Early in the novel, Haruf describes an interaction between Dad and Mary: “She bent forward and kissed him on the head and wrapped her arm around his shoulders and raised up his old age-spotted hand affectionately and held it to her cheek for a long time.” With no needless internal narration, Haruf tells us all we need to know about the nature of their relationship. Through prose in this vein, “Benediction,” at its best, provides a perspective that is simple, but startlingly honest and poignant. The preacher Lyle says to a pair of newlyweds:“Love is the most important part of life, isn’t it. If you have love you can live in this world in a true way and if you love each other you can see past everything and accept what you don’t understand and forgive what you don’t know or don’t like. Love is all. Love is patient and boundless and right-hearted and long-suffering. I hope you may love each other all your days of life together. And I hope you may have a great many years of those days.”There’s nothing really novel about this passage; it’s a little corny, for sure. But given Haruf’s no-frills approach to solemn issues of death and estrangement, such scenes are cathartic when he applies his masterful simplicity to what is good in life.
And yet, “Benediction” is the literary equivalent of porridge. It could be considered a staple—not to mention wholesome—but it does not bring anything new to the proverbial table. While “Benediction” tackles complex issues—death, homophobia, romantic failure, the fragility of human relationships—and Haruf handles each of these topics well, he approaches each from an angle that is all too familiar.  When the struggles of Haruf’s characters come to a head, one would be hard-pressed to envision a more hackneyed way for them to do so. The wife confronts the mistress in the supermarket. The feminine high school boy is beat up by jocks in the locker room. And how does his father discover his son’s secret? He walks in on him dressed in his sister’s clothing. These scenes are written with the same level of technical skill that Haruf sustains throughout “Benediction,” but because of their sheer familiarity, such scenes will elicit groans rather than shock. “The woman fell back in her high-heeled shoes and good dress against the stand of oranges.…The woman rushed at Alene and tried now to hit her with her purse, swinging it.” This is nice, clean writing, and the sentiment expressed rings true, but such domestic jealousy and conflict seem trite when not qualified by anything else. The most powerful moment of the novel comes when Haruf turns a stale circumstance on its ear. A character is faced with a horrible and shocking irony—when you read it, you feel your eyes grow wide. If “Benediction” contained a dozen moments like this one, it would be a remarkable book. Unfortunately, this is a brilliant, brutal outlier. Its strength cannot help but throw the triteness of other passages into relief.Haruf’s superb prose is further undercut by facile dialogue. In Holt and its environs, there appear to be two kinds of people: those who will not admit to feeling anything, and those who are eager to air the most intimate details of their private lives. What’s more, Holtians who are willing to speak their minds all seem to do so in the same fashion. It’s as if, in a bid to save their breath in the high altitude, they have developed a propensity toward clipped, extraordinarily frank sentences. The Johnson women, Willa, and Alene begin to engage in a dialogue about Alene’s lack of a love life:“‘I had my chance and I lost it,’ [said Alene.]‘What do you mean?’ [said Willa.]‘My chance at love and a life.’ ‘That wasn’t much of a chance, I don’t think.’ ‘It was.’”Haruf does achieve a sort of balance with this kind of dialogue, in that his spare prose is mimicked in his characters’ speech, but it’s hard to get past the fact that people just do not talk like this. If the dialogue were more believable and the situations less redolent of déja vu, then “Benediction” might be worth the trip out West to Colorado. As it is, “Benediction” is less of a cry and more of a whimper.—Staff writer Emma R. Adler can be reached at emmaadler@college.harvard.edu.

I’ve found it’s best in life not to have any friends.They take up a lot of time, space, and energy, all of which could be put to more productive ends by doing schoolwork, participating in extracurricular activities, or joining social clubs—which has nothing to do with friends, of course. While it is a little difficult at times not to make any friends, I’ve somehow succeeded in keeping my college friend-count shockingly low. Some say that’s a reflection on me, but I would never be narcissistic enough to say such a thing. And my efforts are finally paying off: The deadline to submit <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/3/3/blocking-group-groups-students/"">blocking groups is on Wednesday. Right about now, across the Yard, it’s the hell week for friendship. Take my not-so-friendly advice: Blocking, as well as life in general, shouldn’t be made about friends.For those who may not know, blocking is the process by which freshmen decide with whom among their friends they will live (up to eight people in each group) for the next three years. Except I shouldn’t say “friends” because often you aren’t even close with four or five of your blockmates, who are there just because they know your friend, whose friendship you are now considering ending because he or she brought these weirdoes (or “block-headed-mates”) in to live with you. Except I shouldn’t say “live” because you don’t even really end up living with all of them as a sophomore. Except I shouldn’t say “sophomore” because you drop out of school during freshman spring because the drama of blocking has ruined everything.By placing an arbitrary yet rigidly defined structure on the “Does he like me?…what a back stabbing… we bro so hard… pssht, that can’t be me in that strange, and what seems like intoxicated, voicemail…” unstructured world of social circles, the blocking process pressures groups of friends into defining their relationships in ways better left undefined. Unless you happen to have seven friends who all love one another and can’t stand anyone else on campus, the result is usually awkward conversations, pain, and betrayal. The friends that were once your support groups become the problems in your life that you need support to face. And the friends that were once the people who you defended, you feel you may have abandoned.The worst part of it is, there’s no clear way to fix the problem. There’s got to be some institution by which people have the option to stick together. And without a defined number like eight people (no matter what that number is), organizing housing would be impossible. But, although there might not be a way to fix the problem directly, there is a clear-cut way to avoid it: don’t involve friends.
If you do involve friends, you end up losing them anyway or at least somewhat altering your relationship with them in a negative way. But when you are friendless, you end up becoming the most friendly and happy person on campus, because you don’t have to go through the degrading blocking process. So there’s no reason to have any friends. In my own interest, I’ll make something clear now: If you still consider yourself a friend of mine, from now on just know that you’re not. If you consider yourself an enemy of mine, remember that I am one of the most friendly people left in the freshman class, so it’s impossible for you to be my enemy anymore—but you’re not a friend of mine either. And if you consider yourself a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenemy"">frenemy of mine, grow up and get yourself a vocabulary.But if you for some reason want to have friends (and I can’t see why), you can still follow a similar route. While it is easier for someone like me not to get involved in blocking schematics, it might be hard for someone who’d prefer to live with people they know, people with whom they have similar schedules, or just people who have nice furniture. At the end of the (<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/8/housing-day-traditions-holiday/"">Housing) day, your blockmates are just the people you are kinda living with, but not really. You can choose to be friends with them, or you can choose not to be, or you can just choose to float. At most, the people you live with (kind of, but not really) should be just one social circle among various other, undefined ones. It is inappropriate for students to make blocking a process by which they make, break, or define their best friendships—it’s only real function is to define, but not really, living situations. Structuring one’s social life based on administrative housing protocol is just a mistake.So, between the inevitable backroom meetings and long nights of worry, just try to remember the appropriately paradoxical slogan “friends don’t let friends block together.” Whether you end up floating, blocking, dropping, or whatever else next semester, as long as you don’t make the process purely about friendship, you’ll always have a friend two, or more, only a few blocks away.But then there’s the Quad…Dashiell F. Young-Saver ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Grays Hall.

As edX approaches its one-year anniversary, the rapidly growing online venture is looking to become economically self-sufficient, said edX President Anant Agarwal at a virtual education conference on Monday.Hosted by Harvard and MIT, the  Online Learning and the Future of Residential Education Summit gathered roughly 200 academic and institutional leaders in higher education, technology, and government to discuss blending virtual and on-campus learning. Moderated panels also facilitated dialogue on the institutional barriers to online education.Launched with $30 million investments from both Harvard and MIT last May, edX is a non-profit online educational platform whose X Consortium has expanded to include twelve institutional partners from all over the world—each of which is required to commit both funds and online courses to the initiative.Agarwal said that revisions to edX’s revenue strategy will look to supplement this institutional support, so that edX can remain a non-profit endeavor without becoming a financial burden on its partners. Future revenue models might fill the gap between investment and income by charging users for special services such as in-person professor contact, certificates, or executive education programs.“As edX, we have very lofty goals, but at the heart of it, we’re building a business,” Agarwal said. “We don’t have to turn in huge profits like Facebook’s $100 billion IPO, but we have to be self-sustaining.
MIT President L. Rafael Reif said that after MIT launched OpenCourseWare—a publicly available, web-based collection of nearly all MIT course content—ten years ago, it quickly learned that donor-based support was not a viable model for financing a nonprofit in the long-term.He added that edX will need to find more funding beyond the seed grants invested last year—and suggested that some of this revenue might come from future university capital campaigns.“Inasmuch [as] Harvard and MIT committed the money, now we have to find the money,” he said. “We have to raise it and we’re spending it, and hopefully a campaign will help us raise whatever we need.”Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 referenced two financial responsibilities held by the University with respect to HarvardX—its initial commitment of $30 million and the cost required to prepare each new course­—as evidence that additional revenue generation will be critical. He noted that alumni have already expressed tremendous support for the initiative.“We certainly are going to be seeking philanthropic support,” Garber said. “But we also believe that this is in our future, and anything that’s in our future, that’s a long-term project [that] needs to be self-sustaining.”—Staff writer Amna H.

On Friday night, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company put on a series of scenes from the Bard’s plays in Adams Pool Theatre. The decadence of the pool that existed, before its conversion to a small, intimate theater—and the tales of coed skinny-dipping and a few fabled orgies—is a stiff act to follow. Nevertheless, the dauntless Hyperion Shakespeare Company was the latest to take on such an endeavor and the verdict? Not bad. The Hyperion performed ten scenes, mostly well-known, from seven of Shakespeare’s plays, with all of the scenes based on the theme “Family Feud.” The production, which played through Saturday, isn’t going to win any awards as a whole, but ran refreshingly short and was supported by a solid, occasionally exceptional cast.This performance consisted of a compilation of scenes, many with overlapping actors. The lights, set, and costumes were very plain, though not necessarily in a bad way; the simple construction lent itself well to a diverse range of scenes. Except for one spotlight on King Hamlet’s ghost, the lights were relatively uniform, with the actors always thoroughly lit. Costumes varied from character to character, ranging from completely black and white garb to conventional jeans and a T-shirt, for no easily discernible reason. Nonetheless, these choices were appropriate and contributed to a casual atmosphere in which the acting could stand on its own.Despite the plain choices and simple production design, which could possibly have made the performance feel thrown together, a lack of technical errors revealed a capable but not extraordinary cast. The actors hit their cues and blocking and delivered their lines with attempted authenticity that is all the more difficult to pull off in iambic pentameter. However, the players did not in the end feel particularly authentic—certainly not spontaneous—and came off only as functional.Despite the beige impression left by the cast, a few performances stood out. Caleb J. T. Thompson ’14, a Crimson arts editor, impressed in scenes from both “King Lear” and “Measure for Measure.” In the “Lear” selection, Thompson played the aging king struggling to decide how to divide his land among three daughters. Thompson’s subtlety with a slight and convincing stammer added staccato to a rich vocal performance. In combination with a slightly bent posture, Thompson read as elderly and deteriorating, creating memorable character in what could otherwise be a flat scene to read, much less perform. As Claudio in “Measure for Measure,” imprisoned and waiting for execution, Thompson does not read so authentically as a man facing death, but he strikes a tone between grave and comic that “Measure” classically occupies, adding nice relief to a generally dour lineup.Another surprising relief from the tragedy and bitter family feuding came from Alex B. Zaloum ’16, who portrayed Polonius from “Hamlet.” In this scene, Polonius delivers the famous line “Neither a lender nor a borrower be,” imparting advice to his son Laertes (Kevin T. Wittenberg ’14) and daughter Ophelia (Lelaina E. Vogel ‘15). Zaloum’s portrayal of Polonius worked—acting sharp and vaguely creepy—and added an unexpected layer of comedy. Zaloum was purposefully rigid and slow; working with his height and slight frame, he appeared eccentric but severe, and his voice was smooth and drawling. His character’s eccentricity and deliberate actions built a mounting tension until Ophelia defied him and he unexpectedly lost it, only briefly, in a personal screaming match against himself. Zaloum’s ability to build tension between his comedy, physical and vocal, and his unexpected severity made the performance stand out.
With a capable cast across the board and even some exceptional performances, the Hyperion’s scene recital was disappointing mainly because the theme did not seem to tie the scenes together fully. The themed scene recital is a brilliant idea—the performance was quick-paced and punchy, running just over an hour—but the theme, “Family Feud,” was too broad (though having brothers Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14, a Crimson arts editor, and Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16 play mortally feuding brothers Edmund and Edgar from “King Lear” was quite clever). Familial issues are prominent in every play by the Bard, and this production would have would have excelled with a more specific theme that built from scene to scene. The acting in “Family Feud” was successful, but the weak connection between the scenes and the overarching, progressing theme made the end product somewhat superficial. Just a little more central direction could have made it into a wonderfully cohesive cycle of Shakespearean scenes. Nonetheless, it was easily accessible, and its short length and quick pace made the production quite enjoyable for a wide audience.—Staff writer Kurt P. Slawitschka can be reached at kurtslawitschka@college.harvard.edu.

On the way back from a tough road trip at Princeton and Penn, the Harvard men’s basketball beat writers convened to discuss the events of the weekend. Below are the highlights from the exclusive taped conversation made available to The Back Page. 
 
On freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and pick-and-rolls…
 
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">David Freed: “Has Siyani Chambers been figured out by the Ivy League?”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Catherine E. Coppinger: “I don’t know if that’s true. Penn definitely figured out how to contain him.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DF: “He doesn’t shoot from outside and he’s not getting into the lane. He’s 3-14 in his last five games.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hope Schwartz: “That’s crazy because he started out as one of the strongest three-point shooters on the team.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DF: “It helps that nobody sets screens for him on pick-and-rolls. Steve’s screen is basically a show-and-roll to them.”
<a name=""jump"">
 
On the way the Quakers played:
 
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Martin Kessler: “I was just impressed by Penn and a lot of people will look at the game and say that Harvard lost because they were considered to be favorite but I feel like Penn won that game the way they played.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HS: “You can’t say enough about their defense this weekend. Harvard was shooting twenty percent for most of the first half. It was ridiculous and going one for ten from three, whatever it was, that was great.”
MK: “Penn is going to be very good in years to come. The Hicks-Chambers matchup will be a good one to watch going forward.”
 
&nbsp;
On the final shot against Penn…
 
MK: “Although that last play, it was really well executed. Relatively, Webby had a fairly open look.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">CEC: “That was a lot better than the look they got two nights ago against Princeton.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HS: “If he’d had a second or two more, I think he probably could have had an open look. He was pretty open”.”
DF: “Definitely feel like it should have been Rivard taking that last shot though.”
MK: “It was weird that all those plays were run for Webby in the second half. They didn’t find Rivard at all.”
&nbsp;
 
On the importance of sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith…
 
CC: “I still think it’s crazy that we lost both those games.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DF: “It’s weird how much our expectations have changed because this is basically a team with five guys that didn’t play at all for most of last year. And they’re probably only going to lose three in the Ivy League.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HS: “After the games against Penn and Princeton, it’s interesting to think that now they have lost to both those teams and how much those wins were a fluke because of how Yatta played. He turned in a performance he probably won’t ever repeat.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DF: “We saw against Princeton how bad it was when we didn’t have Yatta in rebounding. He’s really our only interior defender there.”
HS: “What he did besides the monster numbers was that he broke up Princeton’s rhythms and altered their shots.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DF: “When you have a guy like that behind you that it helps a lot as far as knowing that on the perimeter you can focus more on denying them threes and not worrying about letting them go by you as much.”
&nbsp;
 
On the growth of sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi…
 
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">HS: “I think Steve was really impressive at the line this weekend.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DF: “Steve has been the most impressive person and most consistent Crimson player for us this weekend. He really works on us. He was out there two hours early.”
HS: “That was a major concern early in conference games it that he couldn’t hit free throws with any consistency but it definitely seems like he has figured it out and you can use him in these clutch situations down the stretch where he has a lot of composure.""
&nbsp;
 
On freshman guard Agunwa Okolie...
 
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DF: “Agunwa’s an interesting player. He got the same recruiting grade at Yatta.”
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">MK: “He has the potential to be a Saunders-type defender on the perimeter and I think he came in a bit less raw offensively than Wes. Obviously Wes has taken ten steps forward but Agunwa is farther along at this point than Wes was midway through last season.”

""This picture often leads women to exclaim, 'Give me a kitchen like that!'"" boomed Australian voice artist Bob Kuhn to a crowd wearing 3D glasses and intently gazing at the stereoscopic slide projection before them in the Carpenter Center’s Main Gallery. The image was of the futuristic, all-white kitchen in architect Walter Gropius's house in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and it was only one of the 20-or-so 3D images of Gropius House that the audience was fortunate enough to be able to view that evening.During archival research for their Carpenter Center exhibition “Brute,” which is on view through April 7, artists and visual and environmental studies faculty members Katarina Burin and Amie Siegel found a mysterious box containing these stereoscopic slides and accompanying captions and decided to bring them back to life as a slide presentation. As the legacy of architect Le Corbusier and the history of Carpenter Center came under the spotlight with ""Brute,"" which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Carpenter Center, so in this event did the other great names associated with the building—among them Gropius, a founder of the Bauhaus School of architecture.To contextualize the photographs, VES professor Laura Frahm gave a mini-talk before the slide performance. The talk explored the web connecting the building, Gropius, visual arts education at Harvard, the Bauhaus ideals, and another exhibition put on in the Carpenter Center more than 45 years ago: ""Bauhaus––A Teaching Idea.""According to Frahm, the ’50s were a key moment for the visual arts' rise to prominence at Harvard. Through the 1956 Brown report, the Committee on the Visual Arts proposed a $6.5 million expansion in the visual arts program. The Committee wrote in a 1956 Crimson article, “Perhaps at no moment in history since the invention of printing has man's communication with his fellow man been so largely taken over by visual media as today.” The Committee was successful, and the Carpenter Center, the only Le Corbusier building in North America, was erected in 1963.A couple of years later, in 1966, as work was underway to revamp the visual arts curriculum at Harvard, architectural historian Eduard F. Sekler organized the exhibition ""Bauhaus––A Teaching Idea.” Through this exhibition, Sekler also articulated his Bauhaus-inspired academic agenda for the Visual and Environmental Studies Department, which he co-founded with Albert Szabo in 1968.
Frahm described this agenda of Bauhaus ideals as a vision for total life, which necessitated a new building to provoke new ways of thinking and creating. Concerned with the question of how one can best develop as a human being, the Bauhaus teaching idea did not distinguish between art and life and made the architecture of the learning space an integral part of the creative process. The innovative simplicity of the 3D photographs of Gropius House reflects precisely this Bauhaus grounding of an art of living in the functional form. Each of the photographs' captions gives not just the date, but also the time of day when the photograph was taken, down to the minute, reflecting the same predilection for precision shown in a quote by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe that Frahm cited. ""The Bauhaus was not an institution with a clear program––it was an idea, and Gropius formulated this idea with great precision,” Van der Rohe said in a speech for Gropius’s 80th birthday. “The fact that it was an idea, I think, is the cause of enormous influence the Bauhaus has had on any progressive school on the globe.""Continually devoted to new ideas and inspirations, as exemplified by ""Brute,” the Carpenter Center still carries the focus of Bauhaus that Sekler articulated in the catalogue of ""Bauhaus––A Teaching Idea,” quoted by Frahm in her talk. “It is not a question of imitation but of tradition, in the best sense of that word, when it is meant to include continuous reassessment, growth, and change,” he wrote.

On Friday night the Harvard men’s basketball team failed to overcome Princeton in Jadwin Gymnasium as it tried to retain its grip atop the Ivy League standings. An inspired late comeback left them agonizingly close as they fell just short in the final two minutes, setting up a two-horse race for the finish line in the Ivy standings.
Looking back at the history books, this is hardly the first time that Princeton has emerged victorious. Harvard and Princeton have competed in men’s basketball since 1901 and in that time the men in orange and black hold an imposing record of 129-41 in the series. Of all those losses though, a few stand out in the memory of Crimson fans:
<a name=""jump"">
1. Princeton 63, Harvard 62. March 12, 2011
Playing at Yale for the infamous one-game play-off, Princeton was down, 62-61, with 2.8 seconds left on the clock and inbounded the ball to Doug Davis. As he fell down to his left, Davis put up an off balance shot that had no right to drop. But as the buzzer rang, it was Princeton who had won the playoff game, sending them to the NCAA tournament as Harvard was left still waiting for its first appearance since 1946.
2. Princeton 76, Harvard 48. February 7, 1998
The Tigers ‘97-98 squad was one of the greatest Ivy teams in recent history. The team ended the season leading the country in winning percentage posting a record of 27-2 (14-0 Ivy), including a twenty game undefeated streak, and with a final AP ranking of 8th in the nation. The Crimson returned from Jersey outgunned and outclassed on the receiving end of a twenty eight point drubbing.
3. Princeton 70, Harvard 62. February 11, 2012
Arguably the strongest Harvard team of all time was ranked 25th in the nation as it travelled to New Jersey as favorites for the first time in recent memory. However, under the bright lights of national television Ian Hummer was imperious leading both teams with 20 points as the Tigers prevailed with a late surge. The win reopened the Ivy race, dropped Harvard out of the AP rankings for good, and was unprecedented enough that Princeton fans stormed the court in celebration.
4. Princeton 87, Harvard 56. February 15, 1964
One of the most famous Ivy players in history, Bill Bradley was the top player in the country coming out of high school. Averaging 29.8 points per game over his four years of college in an era without the three point line, he holds numerous Ivy records that could only be broken if the next LeBron James chooses the Ivy league and stays for four years. A three time All-American, Olympic gold medalist and most outstanding player of the 1965 NCAA tournament by the time he graduated, Bradley put clear daylight between the two teams during his four years at Princeton, easily carrying his team past the Crimson during this game. He would later go on to win two NBA championships with the Knicks (having his number 24 retired) and serve as a democratic senator in New Jersey for eighteen years. 
5. Princeton 54, Harvard 51. March 6 2010
Harvard’s best response to Bradley, Jeremy Lin, came forty years later and even he was unable to return to Cambridge with a win during his four years. He came closest his senior year as the Crimson led by seven at halftime. However, turnovers and missed free throws cost the team dearly in the second half as the Tigers scored the final four points of the game to extend their dominance in the rivalry.

With 1.3 seconds left and Princeton up five on Friday, sophomore forward Jonah Travis tossed a lazy pass towards freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. Sprinting from the left block, Princeton forward Ian Hummer knocked the ball out of the air and out of bounds as time expired, putting a definitive stamp on his incredible night. Hummer’s 23 points and 14 boards were the driving force behind the Princeton men’s basketball team’s 58-53 triumph over Harvard. The painfully trite metaphor was very appropriate: opportunities slipping out of the team’s fingertips at the last moment.The Crimson (17-9, 9-3 Ivy) started the weekend on top of the Ivy League and came out playing loose. Warming up for Friday’s game, the team was laughing and joking around. Assistant coach Yanni Hufnagel had guaranteed a win on Twitter; grinning sophomore forward Jonah Travis threw down a pair of windmill dunks during pregame warmups. Nearly 28 hours later, Christian Webster’s desperate final trey landed two feet short of the basket as the horn sounded at the Palestra, and the mood was anything but celebratory. Harvard had dropped consecutive road games at the Killer P’s, out-executed by both Penn and Princeton, which exposed its major weaknesses throughout miserable first halves.Against Princeton (16-9, 9-2), the entire game was played on the Tigers’ terms. Chambers was contained, and the tempo of the game was slowed to favor Princeton, whose dizzying series of backcourt cuts made for an efficient half-court offense. Time and time again, Tiger guards found Hummer in the deep post, where he backed down anyone and everyone. Princeton is one of the tallest teams in the country and Harvard one of the smallest. The Tigers exploited this size well, collecting thirteen offensive rebounds and outrebounding the Crimson by thirteen on the night.In the Palestra, against one of the smaller teams in the Ivy League in Penn, the Crimson faced a different set of problems. Penn’s depth and swarming defense exposed many of Harvard’s tendencies on offense. Quick hands led to a series of touch fouls, but the Quakers, who go eleven deep, consistently rotated fresh guards onto the Crimson backcourt, the members of which play nearly 40 minutes a game. A frustrated Chambers finished with more turnovers (seven) than points (five) or assists (five) and endured another struggle from the field.The issues with depth and size were not unique to one game—Quaker forward Darien Nelson-Henry routinely beat sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith and Moundou-Missi to the basket off bruising pick-and-rolls, ending the game with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Princeton’s ability to bring quality shooters like Mack Darrow off the bench similarly bothered Harvard, whose four main guards (junior Laurent Rivard, senior Christian Webster, Chambers, Saunders) play almost the entire game, with a rotating center in the middle.
While Harvard started slow, on both nights it put together valiant comeback efforts that demonstrated the team’s heart. Down ten and showered with chants of “Where is Casey” and “Honor Code,” the Crimson went on a 15-2 run against Princeton to go up three with two minutes to play. In Philadelphia, the team was down as much as 16 late in the first half before clawing to within two on a late Webster three. Saunders routinely proved over the weekend that he is the best guard in the Ivy League, frequently creating his own offense when passed the ball with 10 seconds left on the shot clock and drawing contact in the lane. He shot 16 free throws over the weekend, and his 15 points in the first half against Penn single-handedly kept the team in the game.Half a game back of Princeton with two home games to play, the Crimson may very well miss out on a playoff for the Ivy League title. A lot of basketball has yet to be played, and this weekend demonstrated that road games are no given in the Ancient Eight. This Crimson team, which relies heavily on a number of players who played little last year, has had a bitter first taste of March Madness. And with it comes the strong uncertainty as to whether it will get a second taste.—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter @CrimsonDPFreed.

The Harvard sailing team fell short of capturing the Sharpe Trophy in its first home regatta of the year this past weekend. After facing seven other teams in the team-racing regatta, the Crimson came out in fourth place with a 5-8 record for both days.“Overall, our win-loss record may not have shown that we stuck with them,” freshman crew Jacob Bradt said. “In each race there was a marked improvement from the previous race.”Head coach Michael O’Connor chose the six athletes who competed in the regatta. Sophomores Brian Drumm, Michael Drumm and Gram Slattery were the skippers competing this weekend, while freshman Sydney Karnovsky and junior Isabel Ruane joined Bradt as crews.Harvard went 4-3 in the first open rounds, defeating the University of Vermont, No. 7 Boston College, No. 10 Tufts and No. 8 Roger Willams. The Crimson fell short to No. 2 Yale, MIT, and No. 9 Brown, last year’s New England Champions.In the two final-four rounds, the Crimson went 1-5, which was good for its fourth-place finish.
Despite temperatures being mild on Saturday and Sunday, the weather did not work in the sailors’ favor, as there was a very light wind both days. Of the scheduled 20 races for Saturday, only three were actually conducted.“In light air, the importance of boat handling…is really important,” Drumm said. “How you conduct [team] maneuvers depends on how good of boat handling you have.”One of Harvard's greatest problems over the weekend was its starts. In team racing, the three boats from each school in the head-to-head match-up start in a marked area of the water. In the first leg of the there-and-back race, sailors are going against the wind, so whichever boat is in front has the advantage and ability to block the wind from its competitors in following FJs.In its second match-up with Yale in the second round of final-fours, the Crimson went 4-5-6.“We had two or three particularly bad starts, and it’s always a sinking feeling [when that happens],” Drumm said. “It’s always very unlikely that you’ll catch up.”Improvement was an obvious theme for Harvard this weekend, as the relatively young squad focused on what it learned in the offseason to put forth on the water. The Crimson opened its spring season with this regatta, but has already been on the water five times for practice this semester.“We had several opportunities in the offseason to sit down in a classroom setting and dissect some common situations in team racing,” Bradt said. “Team racing is a very technical side of the sport of sailing, so you need to have a firm grasp on these different situations and how each person in your boat has to react.”Having extended chalk-talk with the team’s coaches, Drumm believes the team was able to get a better sense of strategy as it moves into the spring season.“[The coaches] explained and reiterated what are some of the key maneuvers you can do to help your teammates,” he said.In this weekend’s races, it was time to put this preparation to test. The team’s plays were both offensive and defensive, as the other schools would produce counter maneuvers.

“I always thought of Harvard Square in the ’60s as like Paris in the ’20s,” says Steve R. Nelson, co-founder of the Music Museum of New England. Instead of novels and poetry, the Square’s dominant art form was music; its Stein and Hemingway were folk legends Joan Baez and Jim Kweskin. The ’50s and ’60s saw Harvard Square at the core of a massive folk revival, a musical movement that largely began with a ragtag group of college students from Boston and ultimately became a nationwide phenomenon.The Square today, however, is a different story. Coffeehouses and clubs are now overshadowed by Grafton Group restaurants and clothing boutiques, as the Square has transformed from a hotbed of culture to an outdoor shopping center. Instead of going to music joints, Harvard students mostly stick to campus events. But hidden behind the towering Coop and CVS, music in the Square lives on, continuing the trajectory that began with the folk revival. The Harvard Square music scene may be hidden to some, but for music fans with enough dedication and interest, it’s subtly still making history.SQUARE ONEIn the late ’50s, Boston was a thriving college town, and the melting pot of students in the area helped spark the folk music boom. “There were a lot of kids who came to [Boston University] that already were playing an instrument,” says Betsy M. Siggins, founder of the New England Folk Music Archives and a freshman at Boston University in 1958. Siggins was closely involved in the folk music scene; in fact, her earliest friends and roommates included Baez and Kweskin. In 1959, her eventual husband, Bob Siggins ’60, formed the Charles River Valley Boys, one of the era’s most successful roots music bands, composed of several Harvard and MIT students.Folk music in the Square exploded in 1958 with the opening of Club 47. At 47 Mt. Auburn St., where Daedalus restaurant and Cambridge Cleaners sit today, the club became a hub for local and national artists seeking a place to play and interact with lovers of the music. The venue was called a “club” because it charged a one-dollar “member’s fee” at the door, and the operations of the club were a true team effort. “I did everything at Club 47, as we all did. Whatever needed doing, somebody just did it,” says Betsy Siggins, who moved to Club 47 from her previous job as a café waitress. “We put most [visiting musicians] up in our houses because we had no money for hotels.” Even the musicians pitched in; Peter Wolf, who would make his name as the J. Geils Band’s lead singer, was a club regular in the late ‘60s and lent his apartment out as a dressing room for club performers.
Bill G. Nowlin, founder of Cambridge roots label Rounder Records, says that Harvard Square’s easy accessibility from a variety of colleges set it apart as a popular destination for musicians and listeners alike. Nowlin was a music-loving Tufts student in those days, and he would often trek down to Cambridge multiple nights a week to enjoy shows at Club 47. “[The club was] not forbidding,” he says. Its grassroots character allowed cash-strapped college students to make live music a part of their weekly routines.The club’s beginnings coincided with national trends. Across the country, college campuses were becoming key to protests and other social movements. For students in Boston seeking mediums for activism, the Square and its performance venues were a perfect fit. “[The Square] was one of those epicenters of this cultural explosion that was going on,” Nelson says. The club also capitalized on the rising popularity of authentic American roots music across the country. Club 47 set up a system with the Newport Folk Festival: the festival would book Southern artists, and to make the trips more lucrative the artists would play two shows—one at the festival and one at Club 47. In later years, many visiting artists at the club veered away from folk towards blues and R&amp;B; Nelson remembers seeing artists like Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt on the lineup alongside acoustic songsters.While Club 47 was the center of the Cambridge scene, it certainly wasn’t all of it. Tulla’s Coffee Grinder on Mt. Auburn St.—an early venue for Baez, though now closed—and Nameless Coffeehouse, still residing on Church St. were among the many venues into which local folk musicians, blues singers, and singer-songwriters spilled. The scene was sprawling but low-key, perhaps the perfect combination for young up-and-comers. “[Bob] Dylan was playing in Boston for $2.50 a ticket, and I don’t mean $250,” Betsy Siggins says. In fact, Club 47 once refused the future superstar a booking, allowing the then-unknown artist to play only during another performer’s intermission. Dylan only spent a short time in Cambridge, but he stands nevertheless among the many musicians—such as Pete Seeger and Joni Mitchell—who rocketed from the Square to stardom.CAMBRIDGE’S “ENGINE ROOM”The folk renaissance began to quiet as the ’60s drew to a close. The spotlight shifted away from the Square as bands like the Modern Lovers—featuring Harvard students Ernie Brooks ’71 on bass and Jerry Harrison ’71 on keys—found new homes at clubs like the South End’s Boston Tea Party, which Nelson managed for a time. These groups took their cues from the Velvet Underground rather than folk and blues-rock, and it was in Boston’s rock clubs rather than Cambridge’s coffeehouses that they began contributing to the punk movement.But music in Harvard Square far from faded away. Venues came and went, including the original House of Blues, which opened in 1992 but moved to a bigger location near Fenway in 2003. Club 47, after moving to a Palmer St. basement and being shut down by the police, was reopened as Club Passim in 1969. Live music can be found at various restaurants in Cambridge, and upscale jazz has a home at the Charles Hotel’s Regattabar, but Passim is still a focal point for folk, blues, rock and more, sharing this position—as of December 2012—with the Square’s newest music venue, the Sinclair.Though they are located just a few blocks down Church Street from each other, Passim and the Sinclair seem worlds apart. Passim was built from the ground up by locals, while the Sinclair is just one of many venues operated by New York’s Bowery Presents organization. While Passim is a 100-seat basement with unclothed tables and vegetarian food—the club doubles as the dining room for Veggie Planet during the day—the Sinclair is a 500-capacity standing-room rock club with a gourmet restaurant added on next door. It is, in fact, these drastic differences that keep the two clubs from butting heads.Passim sets itself apart by tapping into the rich, local tapestry of genres available in Cambridge. “Boston is not really known as a music city…the way Nashville is or Austin is,” says Dan B. Hogan, executive director of Passim. “[The scene is] so eclectic…. we don’t have a label here, and we don’t produce music here, but we have musicians here of all sorts.” Indeed, Boston may not be pumping out hit singles, but the New England Conservatory, Berklee College of Music, and the cornucopia of schools in town are constantly turning out young artists with a variety of musical interests.Passim’s managing director Matt W. Smith, who has spent almost two decades at Passim and is an avid patron of live music himself, believes that the scene owes much to Boston music fans, who he maintains are some of the best in the country. “If we put on a good show on a Monday night, we’re going to have a sold-out crowd,” he says. “It’s a very discerning audience, and that’s a good thing.”A larger phenomenon may be enforcing Passim’s pull—people are interested in acoustic music again. Recent years have seen folk-inspired bands like Mumford &amp; Sons, the Lumineers, the Avett Brothers, and more rise to an international stage. To some, this is a distasteful trend. “There’s going to be a backlash,” Smith says, referring to “purists” who normally enjoy folk music but might be turned off by said bands’ mainstream success.

Sophomore Amanda Sobhy recorded five straight sweeps this past weekend at the College Squash Association Women’s Individual National Championships at Trinity College to win her second straight Ramsay Cup.Sobhy faced Kanzy El Defrawy of Trinity in the final, beating her, 11-4, 11-5, 12-10.Sobhy remains undefeated through her collegiate career, a winning streak that now spans two full seasons. Even more impressive, Sobhy has only dropped one game through all of her wins, a first-game loss to El Defrawy on Feb. 6. Despite the dropped game, Sobhy went on to win, 6-11, 11-2, 11-6, 11-3.“I think she was a little more nervous this time,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “Her opponent in the final, Kanzy, had taken a game off her in their match during the season, and this match was held on Kanzy’s home court.”Sobhy did more than defend her title this weekend—she cemented herself as the player to beat in women’s squash. Sobhy entered the weekend as the No. 1 seed and heavy favorite, and she proved up to the task.
“Amanda was actually more dominating in this match, despite having to play on Kanzy’s home court and having the crowd against her,” Way said. “What stood out more than anything this time was [Sobhy’s] retrieving. She had some absolutely stunning gets.”Sobhy cruised all weekend, starting off by allowing just five points in an easy 3-0 win over Gwendoline Tilgham of Yale. She also topped Rachel Goh of Penn, Danielle Letourneau of Cornell, and Yan Xin Tan of Penn by 3-0 margins on her way to the matchup with El Defrawy, who is Trinity’s No. 1.“I just went in there and was very serious in each of my matches,” Sobhy said. “I didn’t fool around. I just went in there and got the job done.”Coming into the national championships undefeated at the collegiate level, Sobhy had to deal with a unique type of pressure.“She is just so much better than the rest of the competition that it really comes down to just getting the job done,” Way said. “The pressure is there because everyone simply expects her to win.”Though Sobhy may have felt the pressure of being the favorite, her performance showed otherwise. Until the last game of the finals, no opponent scored more than five points against her in any game this weekend.“I knew coming in that there would be a lot of pressure on me,” Sobhy said. “I just try not to think about that pressure. If I thought about it, that would create more pressure on me, so I just go in there and try to be relaxed as possible.”Just two weekends ago, Sobhy helped lead Harvard to a 5-4 win over Trinity to capture the team’s national championship. She beat El Defrawy, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8, to clinch the title for the Crimson.“It is an incredibly long season, so for [Sobhy] to come in and perform at her best is really impressive,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “She was just a powerhouse this weekend, and we are all so proud of what she has accomplished.”Way, in his third year coaching at Harvard, says it is a privilege to work with Sobhy.

In the opening scene of “Holy Motors,” Leos Carax’s most recent feature  film after a 13-year hiatus, the audience is confronted with the image  of the director himself: Carax wakes up in his pajamas in a room next to  his dog peacefully dozing on the bed. As he tours the room with the  slow and cautious steps of an apprehensive explorer charting new  territories, he stops in front of a wall. He begins to feel around the  wallpaper in the dark. He finds the hole he is looking for, plugs in his  right middle finger, which is nothing more than a metal apparatus with a  cylindrical end, and pushes with all his might to force open the hidden  portal, which opens to a theater in which his film is playing.  Carax made a similarly surprising appearance—albeit after  two of his films, and with neither pajamas nor the metal middle  finger—at the Carpenter Center Lecture Hall for the Harvard Film  Archive’s Carax retrospective “Overdrive,” which took place during the  last two weekends of February. Carax is notoriously averse to public  appearances and speaking with press about his work, so it was a rare  privilege to hear the director speak in depth about his work.  When asked about this peculiar prelude to “Holy Motors,”  Carax candidly replied that after such a long pause, he simply had to  assert his presence, confirm on film that he is still alive. This is not  to say, he continued, that “Holy Motors” is a film about cinema. In  fact, Carax stressed that he has a more important topic on his agenda  that fuels his creative endeavors. In line with his definition of cinema  as “the human body in action,” as he said at the HFA, Carax’s oeuvre  seeks to restore the power cinema once had in the time of the Lumière  Brothers and Georges Méliès—when a large, bulky machine’s projection of  a train arriving at a station was a captivating spectacle for audiences  unfamiliar to this visual attraction. Taking after Étienne-Jules Marey,  who dissected the corporeal motion—running of a naked man, the  galloping of a horse, the pole-jumping of an athlete, second by through  the use of his “chrono-photography,” Carax aspires to revive the  fascination with the human body and motion by putting them under a new  light.
  Perhaps the word he used most often during his brief  presence at the Carpenter Center to describe his recent work is  “reinvent.”  Beginning with one of his earliest feature films, “Mauvais Sang” (“Bad  Blood”), Carax showed his debt to both the French New Wave and the  precious era of the silent cinema through segments that are,in the words  of Harvard Film Archive Director Haden Guest, who also spoke at the  event, “theatrically simple [and] richly cinematic”—the magic tricks the  male lead Alex plays throughout the film, for instance. Carax’s thirst  for invention appears under the guise of the indeterminacy of  genre—“Mauvais Sang” mixes the angst of a coming-of-age story with the  leftovers of a gangster movie, adding a healthy dose of science fiction  with the plague of an imaginary sexually-transmitted disease.  In “Les Amants du Pont-Neuf” (“The Lovers on the Bridge”),  the reinvention of space is what is at stake. Carax constructs a replica  of the Pont Neuf—a bridge thousands of Parisians and tourists tread  everyday—in the suburbs of Paris, only to close it for renovation, so  that it becomes home to a homeless trio. On the other hand, “Pola X,”  Carax’s following feature, is based on Herman Melville’s “Pierre: or,  the Ambiguities” and follows a young heir’s discovery of his self-avowed  life’s purpose: leaving his luxurious life in the countryside to look  after his long-lost half-sister, Isabelle, who has been living on the  streets. The first couple of unusually bright and uplifting (and  deliberately pretentious) scenes, which feature a country château, golf,  and horseback riding, quickly gives way to dark cityscapes of Paris’s  immigrant and industrial neighborhoods. Pierre, already famous as a  writer under the pseudonym “Aladdin,” attempts unsuccessfully to give a  new direction to his writing career in strange, unfamiliar, and often  trying environments.  Likewise, reinvention is at the heart of “Holy Motors,”  Carax’s 2012 hit, which was nominated for the prestigious Palme d’Or of  the Cannes Film Festival. A “performer,” Oscar (Denis Lavant)—whose name  is a combination of the last syllable of “Leos” and the first of  “Carax”—shuttles between different lives in a white limousine, rushing  from “appointment” to “appointment.” In this limousine fully equipped  with an actor’s makeup mirror, Oscar can transform himself into anyone,  including an Eastern European beggar woman, a motion-capture actor, a  red-haired outcast by the name of “Merde” (French for “shit”) who eats  nothing but flowers and cash, or a dying benevolent patriarch whose  niece owes him much of her prosperity. In between these episodes of  “performance,” there are fairly short but poignant scenes of preparation  (scrambling for props, donning wigs, putting on makeup) for these  roles in transit, which lay bare the artifice of acting in particular.  There are very few episodes when Oscar is simply himself  outside the boundaries of the limousine. In one of those rare moments,  Lavant shares a scene with Kylie Minogue, starring in the role of  another white limousine-driven “performer,” Jean, who used to be  together with Oscar 20 years ago. They mount the elegant Art Deco stairs  of the now-deserted La Samaritaine, a department store undergoing  reconstruction to reopen as a luxury hotel, while Minogue mournfully  sings, “Who are we? / Who were we / when we were / who we were back  then?” The overwhelmingly beautiful high and low angles of the ascent  are accompanied by the presence of mannequins’ body parts inside La  Samaritaine, as if to dramatically emphasize the fictional  fragmentations of the couple in their personal and professional lives.  “Holy Motors” is thus also a hesitant prodding of the darker side of  reinvention—namely, the impossibility of retaining one’s past after  cycles of re-identification.  If we are to go by Carax’s maxim as stated at the  retrospective, that “we have to reinvent ourselves at some point; if we  don’t, we stop living,” Carax’s work may be a cinema of the reinvention  of the self, space, and medium, but its strength is primarily rooted in  its ability to demonstrate that this process is anything but  straightforward, explicable, or even vaguely graspable. No wonder when  the man with the winemark (Michel Piccoli) asks Carax’s alter-ego Oscar  in what keeps him going, the answer is just an enigmatic “la beauté du  geste” (“the beauty of the act”), but more specifically the beauty of  gesturing, mimicking, moving—or simply, being. —Staff writer Gökcan Demirkazik can be reached at demirkazik@college.harvard.edu.

Amahl Bishara, an assistant professor of anthropology at Tufts, challenged traditional ideas of objectivity in American media on Monday during a discussion of her new book, “Back Stories: U.S. News Production and Palestinian Politics.""The event—one in a series of speakers hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative—discussed the role Palestinian journalists play in U.S. news, and the effect of American media on Palestinian politics.Bishara said her book provides an ethnographic approach to journalism in Palestine, and looks specifically at journalists’ experiences during Israeli invasions, attitudes towards journalists, the process of producing news, and the reasons journalists in the region pursue their work.She said her book also examines American media’s dependence on and interpretation of Palestinian reporting, scrutinzing the concept of the “neutral American” reporter. Bishara said that American media often depends on reporting on the ground by Palestinian reporters, a relationship she illustrated by tracing a quote that first appeared in Palestinian news outlets before being used in the American press.Bishara also said that because American and international reporters lack the institutional knowledge that Palestinian reporters have, they struggle to accurately report on the on-going conflict. She discussed issues with the media’s current attempts to appear fair by using “balanced objectivity.”
“I want to challenge the idea of objective news,” she said. “It always comes from a frame.”Bishara emphasized that the points of focus within news articles—and the structure of news articles themselves—create a subjective lense through which the reader then sees Palestine.For example, by presenting the Palestinian conflict through interviews with different groups involved, Bishara said international reporting suggests a sense of communication between the groups that does not actually exist.Bishara also presented clips from her documentary “Across Oceans, Among Colleagues”, which she said was one of the first ethnographies of the Second Intifada, a period of intense Israeli-Palestinian violence between 2000 and 2005. The clips showed the experiences of award-winning Palestinian cameraman Mazen Dana, who was killed while reporting in Iraq in 2003. She said Palestinian journalists like Dana currently experience attacks on their professionalism and objectivity through both physical violence and legal obstacles.Jeffrey P. Bieley, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, said he found Bishara’s talk both relevant and insightful.“It was interesting to hear about the limitations of journalism and the expectations of objectivity placed on journalism,” Bieley said.

“As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin,” begins Franz Kafka’s novella “The Metamorphosis,” quickly sliding from the mundane to the nightmarish. Vesturport Theatre and Lyric Hammersmith Theatre’s stage adaptation at Paramount Center Mainstage began in a similar, eerie fashion—the Samsa family’s morning bustle was interrupted by the flash of a beetle silhouette, hinting at the change that had taken place. With a creative take on portraying Gregor’s transformation and a set that channeled the creepiness of the Kafka’s original story, the production, which closed on Sunday, had a powerful aesthetic design. The actors were all from Iceland, and it is perhaps this language barrier that prevented many of the lines from reaching their full emotional potential. The show also faltered in the static acting of the performers, making the other elements a mere carapace for a production with a hollow emotional core.The choice to leave Gregor (Gísli Ö. Gardarsson) as a human instead of decking him out in a beetle costume was consistent with Kafka’s wishes—the author explicitly instructed his cover illustrator not to depict Gregor’s transformation, preferring to leave it to the reader’s imagination. Indeed, the original German version never even specifies that Gregor has become an insect, referring to him with an old German word meaning “unclean animal.” Instead of going for a literal depiction, the production opted for a different way to create an air of menace: Gardarsson crawled across the walls, flipped through the air, and perched eerily on furniture. His performances were both breathtaking and unnerving—in one scene, Gardarsson hung upside-down while speaking calmly, the blood visibly rushing to his head. The decision to use this acrobatic scuttling as a means to represent Gregor’s beetle form without actually outfitting him with a shell and wings provided an unsettling alternative to the literal depiction of a beetle.The set and the cast’s interactions with it proved to be one of the highlights of the production. While most of the house was typical and modest, when it came to Gregor’s bedroom, set designer Börkur Jonsson unleashed his dark creativity: the room was at a perpendicular to the rest of the set, with the “floor” facing the audience where the back wall should have been. The walls were studded with crannies that Gardarsson grabbed on to when clambering around. Rather than providing a mere backdrop for the action, then, the set was an integral part of the production, playing up the sinister poetry of Kafka’s original. The pinnacle of this successful cooperation was the flight scene, in which Gregor resolves to leave the family that he has caused so much harm. With golden light streaming into the dark room through the many holes in the wall, Gardarsson entwined himself in one of the curtains and, suspended in midair, gave Gregor’s gymnastic swan song, a wordless performance that conveyed his pain while maintaining a sense of effortless grace.The strongest components of the production were those that were nonverbal; however, cracks started to appear when it came to the acting. The language barrier, which led to unnatural line breaks and inflection, made it hard for the Icelandic cast to emote. The acting itself was exaggerated as well, sometimes to a painful degree. Particularly overwrought were the scenes with the lodger, Herr Fischer (Vikingur Kristjánsson), whom the family received with cringe-inducing shouted toasts. Later on, trying to disguise her affection for their guest, Greta (Selma Björnsdóttir) snapped to attention clownishly and barked orders at him. Because the characters’ emotions seemed to be over the top at all times, their relationships were sapped of their power, and the decay of their interactions over time was not as moving as it should have been. The cast would do well to remember the mantra “less is more”—as Gregor’s mother, Edda Arnljótsdóttir was most affecting when sitting at the foot of the stairs and weeping softly over the loss of her son, but her awkward fistfight with Greta and her frequent bouts of screaming lacked any sense of genuine feeling. The subtlety that made the set and costume choices so strong was completely absent here; instead, the family was presented as cartoonish and flat.It is difficult to take one of the most recognizable works of world literature and add something unexpected, but the acrobatic elements and moments of simple beauty in this staging manage to do just that beautifully. Where the production strayed from simplicity, however, it ran into problems. Had it focused more on the minimal, the unadorned, the show would have captured the tragedy of the slow disintegration of the Samsa family and Gregor’s psyche. As it was, the human connections were drowned out by heavy-handed performances, resulting in a production that turned every character into a beast.

Can you imagine being there on the night of that first performance? The atmosphere? The build-up? The payoff! When for the first time—the first time in the history of the world—that music is being played, that artist’s vision being expressed. I’m not talking about the debut of today’s virtuosos Tiesto or Skrillex, either. No, I’m referring to the first performances from the likes of Mozart, or Beethoven, or Rachmaninoff. Maybe not technically the first times they performed, but the first times they truly performed to potential, the first times their audiences recognized them as greats.I’m referring to classical rock stars, not modern ones—people of musical talent who were revered during their times just as our current icons are today. But the fact that similar language can describe the opening nights for either of these, for yesterday’s classical or today’s electronic, is very telling. Indeed, it only supports a wider truth I have come to know over the last few months: Electronic dance music is the new classical.As ludicrous as this proposition may seem at first, give it a chance. It might grow on you. For example, have you taken into account the fact that, from a purely technical standpoint, both these genres engage their audiences with equally huge varieties of sounds? Rock and roll has its electric guitar, rap its thumping bass. But classical has its orchestra, and EDM its synthesizer, both of which represent a much wider collection of instruments and sounds. The only real difference is that while classical music requires a live orchestra, electronic music requires only its synthetic counterpart. Think of the synthesizer—the primary tool of EDM musicians—then, as a sort of modernized orchestra, a collection of digitized instruments and their distortions.But the parallels existing between electronic and classical go even further than their varied selection of sounds. Both also stand, for instance, as arguably the most diverse groupings of music. They are less like individual genres and more like umbrellas, encompassing many sub-genres underneath. This comparison can be taken a step further when one realizes that many of the sub-genres of EDM directly reflect those of classical.At an artist-specific level, this isn’t too hard to see. Take Skrillex: With his chaotic and unpredictable melodies, he’s like a dubstep version of Stravinsky—stunning, offending, but then ultimately winning over his audiences. But Deadmau5, with his minimal melodies and patience-testing (but worth-the-wait) buildups, reflects the repetitious yet emotionally moving style of composers like Philip Glass or Frédéric Chopin.
In a more general sense, both these genres tend to rely on melodies that are repeated and overlaid onto each other, building up the fullness and intensity of sound as the work progresses, until finally resolving it all in harmony. So while the characteristic, in-your-face “drop” of an electronic song might be lacking in classical pieces, its underlying concept remains.Beyond their actual composition, the role these genres play(ed) in their respective cultures is also surprisingly similar. Young people today might see classical works as out of touch or stale, but when those works were first being composed (and performed), nothing could have been further from the truth. Just as today the fans of EDM stars live for the next performance, the fans of classical composers once lived for their next performances. And just as modern EDM figures continually push the boundaries of what we consider musically appropriate, so too did classical composers push the musical boundaries of their respective eras. Through the genres’ best artists, culture has been shifted—forced forward—by classical and electronic music in much the same way.In the end, realizing the parallels that can be drawn between classical and EDM should only lead to a deeper appreciation of both. Here we have what at first seem to represent opposite ends of the musical spectrum: the wild and young electronic versus the stuffy and refined classical. Yet once this oversimplified and quite inaccurate differentiation is put aside, the connections between both musical forms become apparent. While the outward styles of music might have changed significantly over time—I doubt many senior citizens enjoy Skrillex—the core remains in many ways the same.So the next time you find yourself fist-pumping and head-bobbing to an electronica bass line, take a step back and realize that the catchy synth melody accompanying it isn’t all that different from those classical melodies of yore.Tyler VanValkenburg ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Canaday Hall

I was a junior in high school when it started.Every Saturday morning, I would leave my house in suburban New Jersey and take a train into Manhattan, transfer to the subway, and make my way over to the Manhattan School of Music on the Upper West Side. It was there that I became a musical glutton.One of the privileges of attending the music school’s pre-college program for high school students is complete access to the music school’s library. For two years, my weekly ritual was a walk down along the long series of stacks to the CD retrieval area, a small room separated by a waist-level divider (not unlike a drive-through without the car). I would hand the library worker—usually a somewhat homely female conservatory student, cruelly nicknamed “The Chub” by my peers—an index card with call numbers for the five CDs I’d be taking home.It started off small: taking home five CDs and then ripping them to my hard-drive wasn’t too much to handle. I could listen to a record a day and then hand them back next week for a fresh stack of music to consume. But then I discovered box sets: “The Complete [Insert Artist Name Here] on Blue Note [7 Disks],” “Complete [I.A.N.H.] Sessions on Decca [5 Disks],” “The Complete [I.A.N.H.] on Verve [14 (!) Disks],” etc. At the time, I thought of this kind of hoarding behavior as pre-hibernation for the bleak post-pre-college years when I’d be separated from my beloved source of aural stimulation. Once I finished high school, I figured, I’d finally have time to sit down and listen to all of the music I had accumulated.As it turns out, I now have 21076 items in my iTunes library, i.e., 85 days, 23 hours, 19 minutes, and 54 seconds of sound. To be perfectly honest, I probably haven’t listened to more than a quarter of the songs in my library. What’s worse is that since graduating high school, I’ve discovered an even faster way to acquire large amounts of music: subsuming the libraries of friends via external hard drive, which has added days of music by artists I’d never even heard of (and still don’t recognize, really).
I can’t remember exactly when I realized that I had a problem, but what I can remember is the long series of attempts—mostly failed—to address it: making “Currently Listening” playlists for regimented weekly consumption, trading in my iPod for my CD player (affectionately known as the “oPod”), trading in the CD player for the iPod and going on permanent shuffle, and so forth.Since coming to college, the problem hasn’t just been that I have too much music that I haven’t listened to—it’s that I still have that problem in addition to having even less time to listen to all the music that I haven’t listened to. It’s sort of a mess, and I don’t even want to mention how Rhapsody and Spotify and YouTube are factoring into the equation.But there’s hope. In the past, I think the reason for my uncontrollable urge to assimilate everything like an edacious musical blob was because I was worried about missing out; I didn’t want to pass up a chance to get some music that I might not have such easy access to later. Things are different now, mostly because so much music is available for free, any time and all the time. This comes with its own set of problems, most significantly the threat presented to the livelihoods of musicians, but for myself I’ve learned to curb my music-hoarding compulsions—at least a little bit.When I was younger, I regularly used to read a series of books called “Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader,” which served precisely the purpose its title declaimed. My favorite part was the fortune cookie-length facts, known as “running feet,” one of which would run at the bottom of every page. I remember one such fact—that an adult requires exposure to something seven times before he or she learns to like it (if he or she doesn’t the first time, that is). It’s common sense that the best way to learn to appreciate something unfamiliar is repeated exposure, but I didn’t think to apply this to my musical consumption habits until recently.Setting my mobile music device on “repeat all” has tempered my need to expand my collection, and I’ve finally found contentment in the middle way of repeated listening. I should be forthcoming about this method, though: what probably helped me even more than adhering to a schedule of repeated listening was actually an accident.A little while back, all of my music from my mobile device was accidentally disposed of through some technical issues. I chose not to fill up said device as I had before, and the absence of clutter has kept me in check ever since. That said, there is something inherently reassuring about the plenitude of a full mp3 player—never having to worry about not having enough stuff to listen to—but having too much to choose from is distracting more than anything else. There ends up being too much noise.—Columnist Kevin Sun can be reached at ksun@college.harvard.edu.

A Mahler enthusiast, Boston Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Benjamin Zander has not conducted one of his favorite works—Mahler’s Symphony No. 2— in 40 years. On Sunday at Symphony Hall,  he will rediscover the piece with the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra. The Harvard University Choirs, featuring solo vocalists Barbara Quintiliani and Robynne Redmon and conducted by University choirmaster Edward E. Jones, will accompany the BPYO to perform the masterpiece.The orchestra will also perform Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor with 17-year-old teenage piano phenomenon George Li, whose talent Zander compares to that of internationally renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang. Sunday afternoon’s concert will boast 140 singers and 128 musicians in total, all of whom have worked hard on the Mahler since November. “This will inevitably be one of the greatest sounds known to man,” Zander says.Also known as the Resurrection Symphony, Mahler’s 2nd is composed of five movements. The first consists of a “heaven-storming” funeral march, which, according to the BPYO website, is full of grief, protest, and wild emotion. The fourth, titled “Urlicht” (German for “Primeval Light”), will be sung by mezzo-soprano Redmon. It marks the turning point from death to resurrection in the symphony, as its hero prays that God will guide him to the Eternal Light. The final movement is Mahler’s interpretation of the “Day of Judgment.” “The piece makes [the audience] inspired and crazy,” Zander says. “No one can resist it.”According to the conductor, Mahler himself was taken aback by his own work, even though he created the piece. “This is the most powerful expression of optimism of any piece of music, and its only competitor is Beethoven’s 9th,” Zander says.The orchestra, made up of students aged 12 to 21, began preparing the Mahler back in November.“I can’t imagine when I was that age. I am lucky to have an orchestra that can play with this kind of conviction,” Zander says. The BPYO has plans to embark on a six-city summer tour in the Netherlands to present the entirety of its first season on a world stage.  “This will be a real high point for this next generation, and for me as well,” Zander says. “This is one performance that is not to be missed.”

Allison Macfarlane, chairman of the Nuclear Regulator Commission, argued that NRC oversight of U.S. nuclear technology is important for ensuring the adequate protection of public health and safety.“As the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, we don’t prognosticate or predict the future of nuclear energy or have a stake in it,” Macfarlane said. “We don’t promote nuclear energy; we simply oversee the existing facilities.”Macfarlane provided examples of recent nuclear disasters, such as the Fukushima plant, to argue for the importance of adequate preparation in dealing with potentially dangerous nuclear materials. She said that one of the most important elements of regulating nuclear reactors is to make sure the reactors have a constant supply of electrical energy in order to power their air conditioning systems and avoid meltdown.In the case of Fukushima, Macfarlane said that the earthquake, which was one of the largest in history and caused excessive flooding, prevented back up generators from being able to power the core cooling systems.“Nuclear regulation is something we can’t ever get lax about. We have to continually be on the ball, making sure that our licensees are acting safely and securely,” she said. “We need to make sure that we are up to date with our information.”
Macfarlane also said that, in light of both natural disasters and terrorist threats, the NRC has increased evaluations of protection from excessive inundation, seismic activity, and nuclear sabotage.The lecture was the first of a series hosted by the Future of Energy initiative at Harvard, which seeks to unify members of the Harvard community to create a dialogue about energy related issues.Manoj Easaw, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health who attended the talk, said he came to hear Macfarlane’s  “thoughts on putting our resources in an energy source we don’t know the long term outcomes of.”Easaw added that the use of a resource with a large potential for danger troubles him.But other attendees said that they believe the benefits of nuclear energy outweigh the risks.“It’s an efficient fuel and you better get used to it,” said A. Egon Cholakian, a graduate of Harvard Law School who was also in attendance.—Staff writer Indrani G. Das can be reached at idas@college.harvard.edu.

James J. “Jimmy” Watts ’10 died in an avalanche while ice climbing on Mount Washington in New Hampshire on Friday. He was 24.During his time at Harvard, Watts lived in Eliot House and concentrated in molecular and cellular biology. He was also an avid climber and a dedicated member of the Harvard Mountaineering Club.“Jimmy was such a true leader, mentor, and friend to so many of us in the club,” Mountaineering Club president Nick B. Waldo ’13 wrote in a email to the Crimson. “It is hard to imagine what the current Harvard Mountaineering Club would look like without him. We will always remember him for his caring for others, his quick laugh, and his unfailingly positive attitude.”Watts was in Huntington’s Ravine on Mount Washington when the avalanche was triggered, pushing him 1,000 feet down the ravine, according to the Forest Service.Another hiker found him around 3 p.m. Friday. Authorities believe Watts was alone when he died.
Watts, an Idaho native, was pursuing a medical degree at Columbia University’s medical school, and was due to graduate in 2016.His Facebook page says he worked at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.As of press time, neither Watts’s family nor members of the residential staff of Eliot House who knew Watts could be reached.Check The Crimson for a forthcoming obituary.—Staff writer John A.

A campus debate has flared up over mock eviction notices posted on students’ doors as part of a postering campaign organized by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee.The flyers, which were distributed Sunday in some of Harvard’s freshman and upperclassman dorms, informed students that their rooms were “scheduled for demolition in the next three days.” The notices went on to liken the mock eviction campaign to what they say is a unlawful displacement of Palestinians from their homeland at the hands of the Israeli government. The notices were part of efforts to publicize the Harvard Israeli Apartheid Week, which includes a film screening, a lecture by Noam Chomsky, and the construction of what they call an “apartheid wall” in the Science Center Plaza meant to resemble the hotly contested Israeli West Bank barrier currently being built along the West Bank by the Israeli government.According to organizer Yacoub H. Kureh ’13, the PSC distributed mock flyers on campus at least once before, in November 2010. Though the publicity campaign generated few waves in the past, this time the mock eviction notices have been received with more resistance.After distributing mock eviction notices throughout Quincy House, Kureh expressed dismay in a Sunday night email sent over the House list that his notices had been ripped up and thrown on the ground.And early Monday morning, one Eliot student voiced frustration in a separate email sent out over his House list when he received a mock eviction notice on his bedroom door, rather than on the door of his suite—a placement that organizers say was unintentional. Several other students in Eliot responded to the email largely voicing opposition to the publicity campaign and the Harvard Israeli Apartheid Week.
Steven J. Tricanowicz ’13, one of the Eliot residents who responded to the House email thread, said in an interview that he believes that the PSC “did a very bad job” of promoting constructive debate.“I feel like [Israeli Apartheid Week] goes against what Harvard stands for as a place for open academic dialogue, open thoughts, and open intellectual activity,” said Tricanowicz. “I find it kind of concerning that an event is going on in a way that promotes polarization and closed-mindedness.”Alexander R. Shams, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a member of the PSC, said organizers expected to receive mixed reactions to the campaign.“We weren’t too worried [about offending people] because the kind of events we’re hosting are the reality in Palestine,” Shams said. “If you’re going to be offended by it, be offended by the policies, not paper notices we use for advertising.”Though the flyers provoked ire from some, other students defended the PSC’s right to publicize its events.Kureh’s email over the Quincy House list prompted words of support from his fellow Quincy residents.Kureh said he was “pleased with the response.”Still, Sara Kantor ’14, co-chair of Harvard Students for Israel, said she believes the Harvard Israeli Apartheid Week is “inherently problematic.” According to its website, Harvard Students for Israel “is founded on a belief in the Jewish nation’s right to exist as a sovereign power in its historic homeland.”“We feel bad responding to something that is so outside the spectrum of what we are willing to engage in,” said Kantor, who is a Crimson Arts editor and a former president of Harvard Hillel. “The issue is that it no longer becomes a question of dialogue—it simply becomes rhetoric and demonizes an entire nation and people.”But Kureh said that amid the charged politics surrounding the issues, his group is focused on remedying what it perceives to be forced segregation of Palestinians.“This is a humanitarian crisis,” Kureh said. “We’re going to stay with that.”—Staff writer Anneli L.

Poetry is prized for its unique power to wander the interstices between nature and memory and to synthesize inspiration from many sources. In this spirit, seven poets will be at Harvard on Friday to present their works from “The Arcadia Project: North American Postmodern Pastoral,” a 2012 literary anthology consisting exclusively of post-1995 American poetry.The nearly 600-page collection features formally innovative work in the tradition of the pastoral,  an ancient form of lyric poetry celebrating shepherds and rural life. At the same time, these poems address ideas from an ecological perspective—a style sometimes called ecopoetry—maintaining a consciousness of one’s ecological citizenship and relation to the environment today.The readings will take place in the Edison-Newman Room of Houghton Library and will be co-sponsored by the book’s publisher, Ahsahta Press, and the Woodberry Poetry Room. Poets confirmed for the event include Dan Beachy-Quick, John Beer, Timothy Donnelly, Gabriel Gudding, Dana Levin, Brian Teare, C.D. Wright,  Joshua Corey, and G.C. Waldrep. Corey and Waldrep, who are the editors of the anthology, will also be introducing the event.Though the poets hail from across the United States and use widely differing aesthetic approaches, they are united in their conjuring of Arcadia, an ancient Greek city. The event’s speakers represent a diversity of influences and styles. Beer, whose works have been compared to those of John Ashbery, is the recipient of the  Norma Farber First Book Award from the Poetry Society of America. Donnelly is a poet and assistant professor of creative writing at Columbia University whose style is sprawling, subtle, and enigmatic. Waldrep is a poet and historian who teaches at Bucknell University and is the editor-at-large of the Kenyon Review. Corey is the Gustav E. Beerly, Jr. assistant professor of English at Lake Forest College. Together they create an ecologically focused view of an ancient city.—Staff writer Victoria Zhuang can be reached at vzhuang@college.harvard.edu.

My concentration is apparently the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/14/concentration-satisfaction-results/"">most satisfying one at Harvard: Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality is known for its small class sizes, excellent advising, and wonderful community. Even so, I used to feel nervous walking into the WGS office to meet a professor—until I learned that WGS’s program coordinator would always warmly greet me. This semester, each time she walks out of her office to talk to me about my coursework or my life, thte WGS coordinator updates the sign on her office door with a new sticky note: “245 days without a contract!”Like 4,600 other members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the WGS coordinator has been working without a wage raise since June 2011. Sadly, Harvard's ongoing negotiations with its clerical workers demonstrate a fundamental lack of respect for the people who make Harvard run. Whether negotiations focused on health care, size of the bargaining unit, or wages, Harvard has sent the signal that respecting workers' time and lives is not a top priority for our university.Harvard administrators have repeatedly made public statements asserting the fairness of their wage offers. For example, Harvard has <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/10/update-on-labor-talks/"">noted that “compensation is on average at the 75th percentile.” (Harvard has not cited any sources for this number—and the average worker’s wages were <a href=""http://www.haygroup.com/us/press/details.aspx?id=32925"">predicted to rise 3 percent last year, making Harvard’s wage raise offer below average.) Harvard Director of Labor Relations Bill Murphy argued that “Our benefits still rank in the top 25 percent, so we think it’s a fair and reasonable offer.” These numbers raise important questions: Does this pool of compensations include all clerical workers, or just those at academic institutions? Does it include only unionized workers, or also workers without union representation? And most importantly, when does Harvard ever think it reasonable just to be in the top 25 percent?It’s hard to paint a clear picture of the HUCTW negotiations with statistics. The Crimson argued last week that “With an average salary of $50,000 as of 2011 and wage increases consistently beating local inflation, HUCTW workers are paid well above competitive market rates.” This average salary does not include the dozens (if not hundreds) of temporary and casual workers who are not members of the HUCTW bargaining unit but probably should be. Just as importantly, the thousands of workers making below $50,000 per year must be struggling to keep up with Cambridge’s high cost of living, including skyrocketing rents and food prices, let alone supporting their families.Behind these statistics, dozens of comments on The Crimson’s site point to the difficult reality of many workers’ lives at Harvard. In response to an <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/25/harvard-middle-class/#comment-811750898"">anonymous comment that “It'd be interesting to see how many Harvard staff have second jobs to help make ends meet,” multiple HUCTW members replied saying that they have not one, but two extra jobs on top of their jobs at Harvard. Other workers wrote about working extra hours of uncompensated time to make up for the work lost by Harvard’s 2009 and 2012 staff cuts. “A Harvard Worker” noted, “We've all been working a lot harder these past few years in the wake of mass layoffs and voluntary retirements. Many of us are now doing jobs that were previously done by two people. Yet our compensation certainly has not doubled over that period.”
It is because of the WGS coordinator and other workers I interact with on a daily basis that I attended HUCTW’s 750-person rally in Memorial Church last week. The dozens of students at the rally demonstrated that students—apparently unlike the University administration—value and respect HUCTW workers.As I have learned from giving tours for the Admissions Office, Harvard has the largest academic library in the world. The Harvard Library <a href=""http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/Provost_-_Harvard_Fact_Book_2009-10_FINAL_new.pdf"">boasts over 16 million volumes, 8 million photographs, and extensive archival material ranging from recordings to maps to letters. Tour guides tell prospective students that researchers and academics come from across the country and globe just to use Harvard’s unparalleled academic resources.Yet all of these books are worth nothing if Harvard’s libraries are not navigable, or if there is no one to process, catalogue, and preserve archives. Indeed, the workers at Harvard library are also some of the most experienced, knowledgeable, and dedicated library staff around. If Harvard hopes to attract and retain workers who can maintain Harvard Library’s top status, it cannot simply expect its workers to accept higher co-pays and lower wage raises. Harvard doesn't help its image or its library by arguing that it can skimp on workers' wages.The WGS coordinator carried a sign at the rally noting the hypocrisy of Harvard’s negotiating position. It read: “POP QUIZ: For which of the follow does Harvard think a 75th percentile ranking is sufficient? A) Applicant SAT scores. B) Applicant GPAs. C) Full professor salaries. D) HUCTW salaries.” Harvard is not used to settling for 75th percentile. For better or for worse, HUCTW showed a lot of respect for Harvard when it agreed that workers would take a lower wage increase during the recession to offset the hit Harvard took in the financial crisis. Harvard should show its workers the same respect—and stop arguing that the 75th percentile is acceptable for clerical workers.Sandra Y. L.

“Gotta Get Over”Eric Clapton, ""Old Sock""In the 1960s, Eric Clapton’s bluesy licks and funky jams elicited cries of  “Clapton is God” from his rabid fans. On his new single  “Gotta Get Over,” Clapton revisits these core elements to create a track strikingly reminiscent of his earlier works. The song immediately establishes an upbeat, blues tempo, and the musical fire never dies. Clapton also fashions an impressive mid-piece guitar solo, and the live-performance feel that the song elicits with gospel singers and randomly interjected laughter, harkens back to classics of the past. But it is really the jazzed-up, Fender-filled finale in the original Claptonian fashion that makes this single one of his best recent works. The god is back, and he’s wearing his old socks.""One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)""One Direction
Whereas fangirls will swoon over One Direction’s rendition of Blondie’s classic song, more mature—and less obsessed—listeners may be disappointed. For one, the lyrics, which worked well in the hands of charming Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry, seem utterly disturbing for a boy band. “And if your lights are all out / I’ll follow your bus downtown / See who’s hanging out,” the group sings at one point. Essentially an instruction manual for the art of stalking, the lyrics distract from the otherwise decent vocal performances. Furthermore, the interpolation of the mash-up between Blondie’s track and “Teenage Kicks,” by The Undertones, comes across as unoriginal. Although the band does deliver a catchy “na-na-na” sequence midway through the song, there is nothing new or exciting about One Direction’s interpretation.""Box Chevy""Rick Ross, ""Mastermind""Attempting to listen to Rick Ross’s newest track is, simply put, painful. In this lead single off his upcoming album “Mastermind,” Ross comes across as anything but. For one, the senseless profanity is distracting. A verse is not complete without multiple mentions of “nigga,” “fuckin,’” or “bitch.” And, of course, there is no shortage of “pussy,” which, long his favorite noun, has become Ross’s go-to adjective as well. Ross also unsuccessfully experiments with a new rhyming scheme, complete with words such as “Okechobee,” “Bartow,” and “okey dokey.” Ross’s gangster image will definitely take a hit with this one. But what really makes this single disappointing is the lack of a clear direction—boasting about buying “the blue Lexus,” and blowing up “pussy niggas,” Ross overlooks clarity and originality for clichés and tasteless word choices.

Park Chan-wook is one of several big Korean directors making their English-language debuts—Jee-woon Kim of “The Good, The Bad, The Weird” just released the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle “The Last Stand,” and the thrillingly talented Joon-ho Bong has wrapped shooting on his new picture “Snowpiercer.” Park rose to prominence on the back of his “Vengeance Trilogy,” the second part of which, “Oldboy,” was a cracking success and is being remade by Spike Lee. Park’s own English-language debut, the gleefully overheated gothic potboiler “Stoker,” nods significantly to Hitchcock, but it has a style and strong performances that partially elevate it above other recent attempts to emulate the master of suspense.With its funereal calm and measured pacing, “Stoker” initially seems a million miles away from the kinetic heat of “Oldboy.” Dig deeper, though, and this exercise in style is a pleasing evolution of Park’s visual palette. His eye for a shot and attention to detail occasionally border on the astonishing—combed hair dissolves into cornfields, a belt is drawn through trouser loops with painstaking deliberation, Nicole Kidman’s face contorts and stretches at weird angles. There’s a keen desire here for the viewer’s experience to be as tactile as possible—Park rejoices in leather, stone, and wine so red you can almost taste it, and he utilizes textures, colors, and a richness in the movement and composition of his shots that can’t help be pleasing on the eye.Amid all this, the actual plot is almost irrelevant and doesn’t really kick into gear for a while. When it does, it’s pretty daft. India Stoker, well played by Mia Wasikowska—whose pale skin and luminous eyes receive much of Park’s most sustained attention—is a young girl, reserved and unpopular at school, whose father dies in a car accident. This precipitates the arrival at the funeral of his mysterious younger brother, Charlie (Matthew Goode). Charlie moves in with India and her mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), and the relationship between daughter and uncle starts to develop in a sinister, vaguely sexual, and altogether unhealthy fashion.There are various increasingly implausible plot twists and revelations that build up to an ending that must have seemed farcical on paper. It makes a kind of demented sense when allied to Park’s aesthetic, though, and the actors do a decent job of bringing some ludicrous material to life. Goode’s Charlie has a tan so perfect, his skin seems to glisten like a desert mirage, and he just about stays this side of creepy rather than being completely ridiculous.It’s Wasikowska’s show, though, and she demonstrates again why she’s one of the current It girls of art house cinema, capturing excellently the gradual maturation of a repressed and standoffish adolescent. You can see why Park must have been so enamored of her face—it’s gigantic, as big as a dinner plate, but it hardly seems to move: Wasikowska can emote with the mere flick of an eyelash or twitch of the nose, and the camera can fix upon or glide around the brilliant, white surface of her face. She has the trick of being stunningly beautiful without obviously being so, a pretty uncommon trait among today’s actresses. Kidman, Jacki Weaver, and Dermot Mulroney all do good jobs in supporting roles, and the set, a big old house with many empty rooms and dark corners, winningly conjures up the gothic fairytales evoked in the movie’s title.
It’s just a pity then that the script couldn’t quite sustain the weight of Park’s directorial vision. A tale like this needs to veer off in directions we didn’t expect and give us a story worthy of the storytelling. Instead, “Stoker” is more interested in the inexorable fulfillment of the familiar ritual of the horror movie—ultimately a safe and unsurprising move. The reason Hitchcock was a genius was not his brilliance with a movie camera, but the fact that he was able to reinvent the same genre again and again. “Psycho,” which is directly referenced in “Stoker,” is just such a movie—it completely changes direction halfway through and shocks the audience out of the complacency with which they might go to see a “Hitchcock movie.” At the end of the day, “Stoker” doesn’t have the nous or the courage to do that, and so the comparison between the two films ceases to be a flattering one. This is fun but familiar—and that’s not scary.—Staff writer Caleb J.T. Thompson can be reached at calebthompson@college.harvard.edu.

Last week, in a victory for the causes of public safety and human sanity, the United States federal government <a href=""http://www.boston.com/businessupdates/2013/02/26/orders-fung-wah-bus-line-suspend-passenger-service-over-safety-concerns/sJQfrDJcq7yCfMlsX34LNN/story.html"">ordered the Fung Wah bus service to cease all operations. The Fung Wah service was one in a fleet of several functionally unsound “Chinatown” lines that perilously escort passengers from Boston to Manhattan. Despite the plethora of automobile accidents instigated by derelict Fung Wah drivers in the line’s 17-year history, the bargain of a price unfortunately attracted more than a few Harvard students looking for an economical route back to New York City. The faults identified by the U.S. government demonstrate how each passenger aboard the Fung Wah bus put his or her life in jeopardy. Those structural problems authenticate pleas for an extensive and cost-effective train system throughout the nation.It is truly a shame that so many Harvard students are compelled to take their chances with the shoddy engineering of cheap buses rather than ride in the relative luxury afforded by the Amtrak line. The rationalization is not a complex one: While the astute shopper can purchase a standby bus ticket for as low as $1, train tickets are liable to cost around upwards of $100. Amtrak’s amenities explain this variance in price—passengers are privy to clean bathrooms, WiFi, café cars, and the guarantee of a safe trip home. In addition, trains are rather comfortable and enjoyable to ride, with expansive legroom and nonexistent wait times that place them in direct contrast to the commoditization of the altogether harrying airplane experience.America’s peregrinators are finally recognizing the halcyon alternative to disagreeable and sometimes dangerous travel adventures. A recent study by the Brookings Institution <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/03/01%20passenger%20rail%20puentes%20tomer/passenger%20rail%20puentes%20tomer.pdf"">shows that Amtrak’s passenger count has ballooned from 20.1 million to 31.2 million in the past 15 years. This demonstrative shift in demand was initially met by Obama administration plans for an illustrious national high-speed rail system. Unfortunately, the substandard shape of American finances put the kibosh on this program, and the recent realization of the feared sequester lends little hope to future earmarking for novel spending regimes.This is a shame, as a revamped rail service would reap benefits sure to ripple throughout the economy. It would also increase public safety by luring travelers away from more precarious automobile transportation. While buses may have their place delivering children to school and ferrying tourists around a city, there are few compelling arguments to why they should be relied upon for long distance transportation. At the moment, trains serve as the perfect surrogate. But a rise in demand must be met with a commensurate rise in supply. We hope America’s policymakers understand this basic point of introductory economics and bolster support for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, otherwise known as Amtrak.

The February debut of Netflix series “House of Cards” has critics in a frenzy—but not over anything that actually happens on the show. The topic of discussion is instead its method of distribution. The company released all 13 of the series’ episodes on the same day, making it in some ways resemble a long movie more than a traditional television show.I would like to put on my optimistic hat for a moment and come out in support of the binge release with a dream of what could happen in a future Netflix world. Yes, it’s possible that the shift will move the medium toward film in problematic ways. Unlike traditional networks and premium cable channels, Netflix doesn’t prescribe the number and length of a TV season’s episodes. <a href=""http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/02/04/house-of-cards-netflix-long-movies-and-short-tv-series/"">Critic Jaime Weinman predicts an unavoidable trim down: writers free from restriction will condense what was once a 20-hour season into a three- or four-hour chunk. But while this shift is technically possible, I’d argue it’s far from inevitable. Could the events in the twenty-hour first season of “The West Wing” happen over the course of three? Probably. But would I (and so many others) have fallen in love with Josh Lyman, one of its characters, in just that small amount of time? Probably not.  Likewise, Walter White of “Breaking Bad” wouldn’t so devastate viewers with his moral decay if we’d only known him as an upright citizen for the underside of an hour. Length is an integral part of the television experience. It allows viewers to get to know a world intimately and to gain familiarity with its characters to the point when they feel like real people.The perks of long-term commitment to a work are familiar to us from outside the realm of visual storytelling; for this reason I turn not to film as a comparative model for television’s future, but instead to the novel. My hope is that future television series will take on the best parts of a great book. They’ll require hours of investment, richly portray worlds, and excel in slowly simmering character explorations. They’ll have complex arcs, interweave subplots, and include details outside of those required for the most economic telling of a story. They’ll proceed in distinct sections released together for a viewer to consume at her own chosen pace. It’s telling that “House of Cards” labels each installment not with traditional titles, but instead just as Chapters 1-13.In one of the many fascinating pieces of criticism analyzing potential changes to televise, <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/articles/netflixs-programming-strategy-kill-golden-age-tv,92230/"">Todd VanDerWerff’s for The A.V. Club, VanDerWerff warns the binge release format could lessen series’ quality. In viewers’ rush to the next installment, they may potentially overlook flaws on the episodic level. But the book model could actually engineer the reverse effect. Much of a novel’s value comes from analysis after a first reading. Readers look back on the product as a whole and notice important ways in which disparate elements connect: a line of dialogue in chapter two takes on a different significance in light of a later development; a collection of imagery suggests a different reading than does the novel’s overt plotline. If producers have control over entire television seasons, they may be able to achieve this same level of artistry. This will in turn encourage a more formal relationship between viewer and product. Television won’t be about casually tuning in for a free hour on Sunday night. It will be about watching, repeating, and savoring. It will be about slow care and analysis.Netflix has already created an accessible television canon by releasing complete previously aired series. Future viewers will come to new shows with understandings of their historical context and will knowingly appreciate these shows’ innovations. The site is bringing changes, but they won’t end television’s golden age. Rather, they’ll solidify the medium’s place in our culture as a form of serious art.

With the ever-tactless Seth MacFarlane for a host, there was never any doubt that this year’s Academy Awards broadcast would ruffle a fair amount of feathers. For all of its other failings, the ceremony certainly delivered spectacularly on that front; it took a scant few minutes for the “Family Guy” creator to offend just about the entire audience in an opening number cleverly titled “I Saw Your Boobs.” Indeed, I could easily spend the remaining 600 words of this article just listing which lines he crossed, when, and how, but the time lag between my writing this article and its publication means the rest of the Internet will have beaten me to the punch by the time you’re reading this.But MacFarlane’s particular brand of offensiveness wasn’t the only one on display on Oscar night. In all of the general uproar about the show itself, one could easily overlook the controversial remarks made elsewhere; but once again, the Internet, our one-stop shop for righteous indignation, has us covered. When nine-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis, the Oscar-nominated star of “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” struck a pose upon hearing her name, the satirical newspaper The Onion tweeted, “Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a c***, right?” The uproar—and subsequent <a href=""http://www.theonion.com/articles/the-onion-apologizes,31434/"">apology from The Onion—was nearly immediate, and in the many articles that have sprung up over the past week decrying the poor taste on display at this year’s Academy Awards, this joke is invariably included alongside the bevy of boorish remarks from MacFarlane.While I personally didn’t find The Onion’s tweet particularly funny, it strikes me as somewhat disingenuous to lump it in with the host’s problematic jokes. True, nobody in the broadcast went so far as to legitimately swear, and if they had, they likely would have been censored, as Melissa Leo was when she dropped the f-bomb in her acceptance speech two years ago. No, MacFarlane crossed the line in what I consider a much more egregious fashion.Consider again the “I Saw Your Boobs” song. Let’s overlook for a moment that just about every Oscars ceremony includes a reference to the Best Actress category’s seemingly unofficial rule of “get naked, get nominated.” Let’s even look beyond the fact that much of the list includes past and present honorees whose breasts were only on display in scenes in which their characters were raped (Jodie Foster in “The Accused,” Hilary Swank in “Boys Don’t Cry,” and Jessica Chastain in “Lawless”). No, it’s the fundamental premise behind the song that makes it so problematic; in a show intended in part to celebrate powerful performances, the first reference to many of the honorees reduced them to nothing more than the object of male lust.This objectification was in many ways the recurring theme of the night, though it didn’t always manifest as sexism. When it was Salma Hayek’s turn to present, MacFarlane remarked that there’s always at least one foreign presenter each year and that “we have no idea what they’re saying, but we don’t care, ’cause they’re so attractive,” insinuating that foreign actors only matter for their exotic good looks.Now let’s think about The Onion again, whose intent seems to have been more benign. Though the specific wording was decidedly unfortunate and sexually charged, it’s clear to me that the goal was not to malign Wallis’ femininity. Instead, the joke is that, well, she’s nine years old and adorable, and it’s ridiculous to suggest that anybody could possibly dislike her. In what was undoubtedly a frenzied moment in the fake news room, somebody went too far—way too far—and the joke took on implications it was never supposed to have; replace the c-word with something more mild and the tweet becomes funny again.
As I wrote at length in my last <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/column/critically-thinking/article/2013/2/20/In_Praise_Of_Criticism/"">column, I’m not one to overlook poor execution solely on the basis of good intentions—and besides, I see no reason to defend a joke that I found tasteless and unfunny. Still, the distinction between the off-color tweet from The Onion and MacFarlane’s bad jokes is, to me, more than enough to warrant a different response. The former certainly crosses a line, but it does so because somebody wrote it improperly; the latter crossed lines in their very premise, in the fact that somebody thought that casual misogyny and racism were acceptable attitudes with which to approach Hollywood’s biggest celebration. If you’re in the mood for righteous indignation, it’s certainly called for in either instance; but in this case, perhaps not all outrage is created equal.—Columnist Jeremy Y.

Though Trevor Powers, the man behind Youth Lagoon, is just releasing his sophomore album, his musical aesthetic already seems to be set in stone. “Wondrous Bughouse” continues Powers’ traditional atmospheric sound, which he creates with bright, sometimes ethereal synths and understated vocals. There are places, however, where “Wondrous Bughouse” breaks away from the strategy set by Youth Lagoon’s debut, “The Year of Hibernation.” It more readily embraces dissonance and distortion, which make it an album that is not always beholden to the conventions of synth-pop. However, the album does stumble on its more pointed deviations. Ultimately, Powers’ musical experiments within the context of his established sound allow him to produce an album that, if nothing else, delivers a unique but unrefined experience filled with ambient whimsy and delightfully confusing innovation.In his first track, “Through Mind and Back,” Powers forcefully reveals the principle-breaking evolution upon which he continues to draw on throughout the album. The song begins with overt dissonance, and as the purely instrumental track progresses, creaky twangs are layered over a bed of deep reverberations, until the track eventually devolves into what sounds like nothing more than the whirring of machines. Even so, the song is an efficacious introduction to the album, almost serving as a preparatory period for the more experimental tracks to come.Indeed, Powers builds directly from the oddity of “Through Mind and Back” with the next two tracks in the album, creating an experimental trio of songs. The rather mystifying note choices from “Through Mind and Back” are reflected in the second track, “Mute,” which employs distorted synths to disrupt the otherwise pleasant melody and make complacency all but impossible. This insistence on active listening continues with the next song, “Attic Doctor,” which is in the ever-unexpected triple meter. The effect of these eccentric musical decisions is the creation of a paradoxical sound—these songs feel like ambient noise even as they refuse to fade into the background.Though Powers never completely reverts to compositions akin to those of “The Year of Hibernation,” the album does become less dissonant and more charismatic as it continues. Powers still hints at discordance and throws in another song in triple meter, “Daisyphobia,” but the peculiarity is limited enough that “Wondrous Bughouse” remains an intersection of curiosity and approachability. The epitome of this interchange is the penultimate track, “Raspberry Cane,” which combines moments of light distortion, an extremely catchy vocal and instrumental melody, and a solid beat that carries the song along for much of its six minutes.This pop-like catchiness, however, should not be a cue to disregard the album thematically. The sugary synths create a platform for surprisingly existential and oblique lyrics. The songs almost exclusively concern themselves with self-reflexive thinking. In “Mute,” Powers sings, “The devil tries to take my mind / But I can’t quite get inside.” Fittingly, Powers’ verses on this track—which are difficult to decipher auditorily—are almost opaque in their meaning as well. Powers takes this insistence on lyrical and melodic cloudiness too far in “Wondrous Bughouse,” though, to the point that a vast majority of the lyrics are incomprehensible without re-listen after re-listen. In fact, the major flaw of this album is the extremes to which it takes what are fundamentally good ideas. At points in the first track the dissonance becomes excessive and overwhelms the forward momentum, and the triple meter of “Attic Doctor,” particularly the painful emphasis of the first beat, is so strongly pronounced that it becomes nauseating by the end.
It is true that Powers has a great album on his hands. It is also true that it could have benefited from critical revision so that its fantastic concepts could be expressed with more moderation.  Powers took a major step toward releasing his creative potential on “Wondrous Bughouse,” but because of his failure to properly harness his raw, imaginative energy, he has created an album whose inventiveness is compromised by its overstriving.

Storyteller Xanthe Gresham has been travelling the world and captivating audiences with her energetic, creative performances for almost 20 years. Her repertoire of stories spans a wide range of cultures and time periods, and she has performed everything from the “Epic of Gilgamesh,” one of the oldest surviving literary works, to her own contemporary storytelling pieces.  Gresham will be performing selections from the Persian epic “The Shahnama” today at the Sackler Museum, and will also be conducting a storytelling workshop at Arts @ 29 Garden tomorrow.The Harvard Crimson: Was storytelling, or listening to stories being told, a big part of your childhood?Xanthe Gresham: I studied literature at Oxford, so I've always read. But yeah, strangely enough, I had quite a strong church upbringing, and I always had to listen to a lot of Bible stories. Sometimes I feel like I ended up doing what I hated as a child—telling stories and using a lot of religious material.THC: What would you say are the key skills a good storyteller needs to have?XG: A good storyteller has to like stories. They have to need stories. As a child I used to like certain stories that I read again and again, and novels, and when I was at school I used to memorize poetry on my long walk to school…. You need that passion as a storyteller. You need to love language and playing with language.
THC: How much do your performances evolve and differ from past renditions of the same story?XG: It really will be a different experience each time. Some of the stories are quite fixed, but others I improvise quite a bit more. With stories for children, I do a lot more improvisation, because they are more involved with the story….  And you're reading the audience’s reactions all the time and adapting your story. It’s very much like a conversation.... The [size] of the audience makes a big difference. The energy of the performance gets bigger with a bigger audience. When it’s a smaller audience, it's more intimate and more conversational.THC: You work with a lot of different storytelling cultures and stories from all over the world. Do you ever feel a cultural disconnect to a story because you aren't from that area? How do you overcome that disconnect?XG: I do. I overcome it through reading the text and [through] research like looking at museum artifacts. If a story speaks to you in your heart—it sounds sappy—and you work hard, then you can overcome the cultural differences…. It’s interesting because I'm only just coming to the U.K. myths, although I’m from the U.K. I've got a commission to do something with the Arthurian cycle, maybe about Morgan le Faye, this July. It’s so odd, because I've never been interested in my own culture and I studied all these stories from other cultures, and I followed them, and they brought me home.THC: What will you be doing in your upcoming workshop at Harvard?XG: My workshop is basically a storytelling class. I'll be discussing the little pockets of stories I know well and my experience storytelling. Storytelling has been a job for me but also a process that has helped me to work through various things in my life. And I'll be talking about practical ways to tell a story. Storytelling works because it triggers images in people’s minds and you have to work to build the world of the story through words…. It helps to be brave in storytelling, so I always encourage students to tell it in their own way and make it their own.

To title an album “XO” is a bold statement. A kiss and then a hug—a simple, casual valediction reserved for the closest relationships, the letters “xo” seem to be most at home carved into the weathered wood of park benches. “xo” means memories and being stuck between youth and growing up.Fortunately, Elliott Smith was a master of devastatingly personal songwriting, and his 1998 album, named after the sweetest two letters to ever be left on a page, is both the salt and ointment to the wound of heartbreak. It’s an album about breaking up, but not just losing a lover; “XO” is an album about breaking up with someone you love and then breaking up with yourself. The 14 tracks could be considered an autobiography of sorts—from the casually impassioned “Sweet Adeline” to the defeated “I Didn’t Understand,” Smith explores every nook and cranny of his despondent and often sequestered mind.Over the years, I’ve built a home among the most beautiful moments that populate “XO,” and the carpet is marked with Smith’s shoe prints. He taught me that breaking up with myself is easy to do. “Cut this picture into you and me / Burn it backwards, kill this history” are the lines that open the album, and this idea of forcibly excising something slowly evolves and takes on multiple meanings throughout the record. On “Waltz #2 (XO),” Smith’s repeated plea, “You’re no good, you’re no good, you’re no good” becomes one of the most matter-of-fact and cutting lines from the album. What better way to stop loving yourself than to convince yourself that you’re not worthwhile?Despite the occasional stunningly delivered line, though, Smith isn’t an incredible lyricist. He creates an atmosphere dependent not on any particular phrase, but on the emotional pathos that saturates the album as a whole. Smith avoids detailed personal sketches that might isolate him from his listeners, making his music all the more relatable. Because of this accessibility, I gradually adopted “XO” to be a story about my own life. Elliott Smith and I had a long distance relationship, but the distance was more through time than through space. Ten years after the release of “XO,” Smith’s claim on the fifth track, “Pitseleh”—which lyrically  works to deconstruct the system of endictment in relationships—that “no one deserves it” helped me imagine a blameless world, safe from the accusations of others, but mostly from the accusations of myself. All people are too hard on themselves, and I knew that—but it was different hearing that assertion come out of someone else’s mouth. But throughout “XO,” Smith chooses to deny hope, instead sounding resigned and, occasionally, regretful. After all, he has nothing to prove—despite this album being his first on a major label, “XO” retains the close, intimate feel of the multi-instrumentalist’s solo work.The album’s greatest strength is epitomized by the quiet piano intro to “Waltz #1,” which is marked by magical, shimmering overtones of the earlier waltz on the album. The sparsely amalgamated instruments provide the perfect backdrop to Smith’s characteristically double-tracked vocals, which themselves carry a certain honesty and sadness. A minute or two into the track, a single piano line accompanies his voice as he offers a striking lament, “What was I supposed to say?” It is in this moment that the album’s defining and greatest characteristic becomes clear—that, at the end of the day, the best word to describe the doubt-filled, ever-questioning “XO” might be “human.”
Being at a loss for words is not what you might expect from a songwriter, but it is this humble uncertainty that breathes life into “XO.” The moments that stuck most closely with me were when he seemed the most unsure—the ambiguous discontent of “Oh Well, Okay” and the glorified ambiguity in “A Question Mark.” Even the pop-influenced tracks such as “Bled White” that disappointed Smith’s biggest fans upon the release of “XO” retain a sense of intimate honesty. In truth, all of these tracks are organic products of a man whose career was born through raw emotion and acoustic guitar.Although “XO” is an album that taught me the art of breaking up, it ultimately helped me put myself back together. At the very least, it helped me come to terms with the part of me that wanted things to fall apart and for me to forget. I wouldn’t be exaggerating very much if I said that every day comes with a reminder that I won’t be hearing from Elliott ever again—this October will be the 10-year anniversary of his death. Although two of Smith’s studio albums were released—one posthumously—after “XO,” I consider its final track, “I Didn’t Understand,” his goodbye, if not to the world, then at least to me. Sometimes, I revisit the album, but other times, the shoe prints on the carpet stop me from making it past the foyer. The freshest of them all is on this final track, when his voice tiredly declares through the warm blanket of a capella vocals, “There’s nothing here that you’ll miss, I can guarantee you this.”Elliott, you couldn’t have been more wrong.xo

The war for Yardfest opening act has been waged, and The Cantab Cowboys and Puttanesca have come out on top.<!--more-->Last weekend at the Cambridge Queen's Head Pub, five student bands competed to earn a spot at this year's Yardfest.So who of Harvard's own do we have to look forward to?""The idea of the band is that we do interesting instrumentation on modern songs,"" said Nina L. Hooper '16, the harpist for Puttanesca. The band is an 11-piece ensemble that has everything from the drums to a harp to a yangqin, a Chinesen dulcimer. Hooper said she isn't sure as of yet what Puttanesca will be performing. ""Were looking at maybe doing 'Sail' by Awolnation—something fun like that.""Matt R. Shuham '15, the drummer for The Cantab Cowboys, said the band plans to perform some of the songs that helped them win last weekend's battle of the bands. ""We do a lot of classic country music, but also more modern stuff—a lot of indie rock and country rock mixes,"" he said.

A month after administrators announced to a packed University Hall that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences would move to Allston, Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting was comparatively uneventful, with few attendees and fewer announcements.While faculty members expected a continuation of last month’s discussion on academic integrity, academic culture on campus was not mentioned until question period.The second meeting of the semester instead focused on policies to clarify faculty involvement in online education and new findings on gender imbalances in the faculty’s tenured ranks.TWEAKING THE RULEBOOKIn light of the rapidly growing potential to offer higher education courses online, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith began the meeting by highlighting the need to redraw guidelines on how professors report work done outside of the University. Administrators are currently updating existing policies on reporting outside activity across the University, Smith said.
“We have seen a true explosion in the kinds of opportunities that are before our faculty to do work not only here on this campus, but to explore educational opportunities outside this university,” Smith said.University President Drew G. Faust echoed Smith’s statements, noting that clear expectations are imperative to ensure that outside work does not detract from the teaching and learning goals of professors on campus.“How do we sustain that balance between the special obligation to students at Harvard University and meld it with other opportunities?” she said.The proposed policies would require professors to consult with divisional deans if they wish to distribute educational content over the Internet through non-Harvard platforms, a procedure that some professors said raises questions about ownership and control of educational materials.“Do these draft principles assume that the University can control any educational content produced by the faculty placed on the internet?” asked English and comparative literature professor James T. Engell ’73. “How can the University control this material if it does not own it?”The deadline for faculty comment on the draft policies is April 15, a week before next month’s Faculty Meeting.BALANCING THE RANKSIn the only docketed agenda item of the afternoon, biology professor Elena M. Kramer, chair of the Standing Committee on Women, reported that the percentage of tenured and tenure-track women has leveled out at 25 percent over the last six years—casting Harvard behind some of its peer institutions in terms of gender balance in the faculty. Kramer added that she thinks tenure-track searches would benefit from a more deliberate effort to recruit talented young female academics and hopes that the report will spur further review within individual departments.“This is very scary to me,” Smith said of the slowed pace at which women are offered tenured-track professorships. “In a noticeable number of places we’re not working hard enough to recognize women and underrepresented minorities to get them into our applicant pools for our tenure-track positions.”Smith acknowledged the faculty’s need “to do better in this area” and suggested that best practices for hiring women will be considered in the approval of all future faculty searches,

For teenagers or young “twenty-somethings,” Harvard students tend to act a lot like forty-year old corporate executives. I’m not talking about a general obsession with business casual or the fact that the only sport we really seem to excel at is squash. Instead, I am referring to how Harvard students, like workaholic professionals, seem to have time only for work, be it academic or extracurricular. “Social time”—hanging out with friends—has to be “scheduled in,” often weeks in advance. People too often ask  friends to grab lunch only to be told without irony, “Let me check my G-cal and get back to you.” Marissa A. Mayer, new CEO of Yahoo, would be <a href=""http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/"">horrified at the measly amount of interaction occurring between Harvard students. If she thinks the lack of “communication and collaboration” among Yahoo employees is a problem, I tremble to think of her reaction to the anti-social atmosphere of this campus.This may seem like an obvious statement—just an everyday fact of life here at Harvard. Everyone is busy, and everyone is excited and dedicated to various schoolwork and activities. It is a wonderful characteristic of our university that so many people are passionate about all the different things that they're doing. Getting A’s in classes, dancing some fabulously strange dances at Ghungroo, and attending every Phillips Brooks House Association open house all rightly receive our full attention and intensity. However, when it comes to making time for friends, we fall short. This is a mistake.College life—the opportunity to live with all your friends and see them each and every day—never happens again. The older we get, the harder it will be to find time to just chat and coexist. Families, work, and in my probable case, caring for my obese cats, will start to take precedence in later years as friendships start to exist for weekends and special occasions. Here and now at Harvard, we have the opportunity to engage with our friends in unstructured ways; yet this is usually the last thing we're thinking about. I mean, these are supposed to be the best years of our life, man.I’m not arguing that Harvard students should stop working hard or forsake all activities on campus. But I do think it would be valuable to stop behaving as if we’re all on the fast track at Goldman Sachs. That p-set is still going to get done even if you go to brain break for fifteen minutes. Who says that if you don't comp every single publication on this campus and fail to attend every IOP study group, you will be earmarked as a loser for the rest of your life? One trip to Pinkberry is not going to throw your political career under the bus. Although it seems like there is absolutely no time, such a characterization is untrue. We do have time. And we could all put in the effort to make a little more.You may ask yourself why this even matters. We go to Harvard to learn and to succeed, not to shoot the breeze and banter. It matters for two reasons.
Firstly, we need haphazard human as well as sterile electronic connections to enrich our lives and keep a sense of perspective in such a high-stress environment. There is so much neurosis at Harvard that more downtime with friends can only help dial back our anxiety. With all the recent talks about mental health, I cannot help but wonder if we might be a little less stressed if only we spent more time talking to each other rather than typing in earnest.Secondly, some of the best ideas come from schmoozing. Just bantering about something random may trigger one of those eureka moments of uncalculated innovation. It was a casual remark by a Microsoft guy that got Steve Jobs moving quickly on the Pad. Friends can inspire you in ways big and small, sometimes even with an irreverent comment or offhand joke. As Marissa Mayer noted in her memo to Yahoo employees, “Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings.” Although many of her employees may have been furious, I think in time they will agree with her wisdom.If we all make a little more effort with each other, I think our lives on campus will improve significantly. And this means real effort, not a text with a grinning monkey emoji. (Is that supposed to be a signal that you want to get dinner?) The constant refrain of “too busy” should be abolished from our vocabulary. Many years from now, looking back, we will regret it if we spent these years glued to our laptops instead of each other. As John Lennon once sang, ""Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.""Isabel H. Evans ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is an English concentrator living in Adams House.

My little sister was three days old when the first bombs fell on Baghdad. Today, she’s two weeks from her tenth birthday, but the American military only withdrew from Iraq three months ago and continues the war in Afghanistan.By the time U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, children old enough to be in high school will have never known a day when their country was not at war. On the other side of the world, a whole generation of Afghani and Iraqi children, by sheer accident of birth, cannot forget a scarred legacy—of the relentless explosions around them, the menacing whine of deadly jets above them, and the graves of their loved ones below them.These long-lasting miseries are the casualties unaccounted for in official body counts. Living through 9/11 and its aftermath as a seven-year-old Muslim boy in New York City gave me a glimpse into the sorrows so sadly routine in less fortunate parts of the world. Like the billowing smoke I could see rising from Manhattan, an epidemic of grief quickly perforated the thoughts of my city and my country. In rash decisions to commit violence or to wage war, too little gravity is given to incalculably severe human costs.But this is not an apology for pacifism. I am not opposed to all war—I am only opposed to pointless wars.Yet the near decade-long occupation of Iraq—after a rushed decision made on the basis of cherry picked intelligence later proven to be spurious, before United Nations inspectors could thoroughly investigate alleged stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction—is not the only pointless war waged by our feckless leaders.
Consider Congress, that dysfunctional, dyspeptic body only capable of trundling from one manufactured crisis to another. In the needless, melodramatic wars waged by grandstanding, self-indulgent officials, the inevitable casualty is the well being of the young, the minorities, and the poor—in short, the unconnected.Our predilection for pointless wars disenchants both our citizens and the citizens of the world. Americans see our soldiers, some grievously wounded, others killed, and many disturbingly abandoned, fighting a war in Iraq founded on false premises. Americans also see our politicians, captured by lobbyists and special interests, whose deification of ideological purity and delusional conflation of obstinacy with martyrdom constitute a dereliction of duty to the American people.More pernicious than this inflated belligerence—and perhaps the only issue with unwavering bipartisan support—is the collective refusal to learn from or even acknowledge the dire consequences of our unnecessary wars.Many of the most vocal supporters of the invasion of Iraq still loudly preach that their decision was not only vital but also beneficial. John R. Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. during the Bush administration, continues to fear monger by disingenuously <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/15/america-withdrawal-iraq-world-instability"">declaring that American withdrawal from Iraq “is a tragic mistake” and “heralds a world of instability.”James Fallows, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, rightly points out the <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/as-we-near-the-10th-anniversary-of-the-iraq-war/273504/"">noxious persistence of prominent demagogues like Donald H. Rumsfeld, noting that “after Iraq, there has been a weird amnesty and amnesia about people's misjudgment on the most consequential decision of our times.”Claiming that the world is a better place since the removal of Saddam Hussein, perhaps the only original justification for the war that has not been thoroughly debunked, ignores the realities of more than <a href=""http://www.iraqbodycount.org/"">110,000 civilian deaths, a resulting power vacuum that enabled an increase in Iranian influence, and the grim precedent set by defying the international community to fight an unnecessary offensive war.Moreover, the American stance toward totalitarianism, dictatorship, and human rights abuses is capricious and hypocritical at best. It would explain the lukewarm reception to certain populist democratic movements like the Arab Spring and the close trade relations with known human rights violators like <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-china"">China and <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-saudi-arabia"">Saudi Arabia. America props up unscrupulous and ruthless dictators when expedient, like the Shah of Iran, General Pinochet of Chile, and countless others, but somehow proclaims itself as a beacon of liberty and democracy to the rest of the world.More than <a href=""http://www.defense.gov/news/casualty.pdf"">4,000 American soldiers lost their lives fighting a war for little reason: alleged Iraqi ties with Al-Qaeda were fictive and weapons of mass destruction are nowhere to be found. To some, such a statement may seem unpatriotic for somehow dismissing the sacrifice of soldiers. But the truest patriotism and highest regard for our soldiers is not found in lip service, but instead in the prevention of the needless sacrifice and sorrow in the first place.In Iraq, hundreds of children must live as orphans because of an impetuous judgment made a decade ago—in America, hundreds of children will now have to go <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/us/politics/poor-face-most-pain-as-automatic-budget-cuts-take-effect.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=0"">without baby formula because of the self-inflicted sequestration enacted only a week ago.Unless curtailed, our insatiable penchant for unnecessary wars will only continue to dole out damage.Idrees Kahloon ’16 is a Crimson editorial writer in Weld Hall.

After losing two EIVA conference games this weekend, Harvard men’s volleyball swept MIT, 3-0, on Tuesday night at the Malkin Athletic Center.The road losses put the Crimson (10-4, 5-3 EIVA) in fourth place in the conference. With a three-day turnaround, coach Brian Baise believed the key was his team’s mentality.“Coming off those tough league losses, I wanted us to be loose and I wanted us to be aggressive,” Baise said. “Most importantly, [today] we were focused and we were confident.”It was a close first game for Harvard, which escaped with a narrow 25-23 victory. The Engineers (11-10) held a lead for nearly the entire set, until an attack error pushed the score to 21 apiece. The two teams exchanged the next four points until the Crimson was able to seal the win.“One of the first things you remember when you step onto the court is your mistakes from the last time,” said junior co-captain and outside hitter Nick Madden, referring to the uncomfortably tight first frame.
“The challenge is to be tough enough to get over that,” Madden said. “Being able to let go of your past mistakes and then move onto the next point.”MIT’s offensive efforts were strongest in the first frame, where the Engineers registered 14 of their 33 kills on the night.Senior Matt Hohenberger led the Engineers with 10 kills.“Our defense wasn’t closing our blocks very well, which was probably the biggest difference I saw between games one and two,” said Madden.Harvard took an early lead in the second game but allowed MIT to climb back and knot the score at 11. After calling its first time out of the night, the Crimson returned to the floor and finished the game in convincing fashion, winning 25-17.In the third frame, the two teams traded points until Harvard gained an 11-8 edge. The Crimson was able to hold on to its lead this time, winning the final stanza 25-19.“I’m glad we had the fortitude and strength to come back after the first game,” Madden said. “We came back and got those last points we needed and then continued in the last two games.”Junior libero Chris Gibbons had 11 digs for Harvard, four more than MIT’s defensive specialist Brendan Chang. The Crimson’s 34 digs on the night outpaced the Engineers’ 25.“Especially after the first game, I thought our defense was excellent,” Braise said.“Chris was all over the back row,” Madden said. “He was really loud [and] really the general of the back row tonight. I give him my player of the game honors tonight.”

In October 1988, a ten-year-old girl <a href=""http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-10-17/news/8910172856_1_noriega-panama-city-sarah"">named Sarah York traveled to Panama to meet with her Panamanian pen pal, the infamous military leader Manuel Noriega. Noriega was widely known in the United States as a corrupt leader who was later tried by the United States for drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering. There were also widespread claims that the Panamanian military, under Noriega’s command, engaged in <a href=""http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/panama-fresh-investigations-urged-after-manuel-noriega-extradition-2011-12-13-0"">widespread human rights abuses and harassment of US troops and civilians.Sarah York’s continued visits and correspondence with Noriega were met with widespread disapproval at the time, by a public and political atmosphere that considered Noriega “Public Enemy Number One” at the time of the U.S. invasion of Panama. However, Ms. York and her family emerged with a very different account of this supposedly ruthless dictator, a unique point of view in the midst of highly biased coverage. While it can be argued that Ms. York was at a highly impressionable stage of her life and that Noriega was simply using her for political gain, the perspective was important in creating discourse.On March 3, 2013, retired American Hall of Fame professional basketball player Dennis Rodman returned to the U.S. after a highly controversial trip to North Korea where he met and engaged directly with dictator Kim Jong Un. Rodman, nicknamed “The Worm,” returned with <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/03/03/obama-dennis-rodman-kim-jong-un-north-korea/1959853/"">praise for Kim, saying “I love him. The guy’s awesome. He was so honest.” Many outlets are considerably and understandably critical of Rodman’s visit, which has been described as a lavish celebration of basketball greats filled with copious amounts of food and drink. These festivities stand in stark contrast to the millions of North Koreans in <a href=""http://www.wfp.org/countries/korea-democratic-peoples-republic-dprk"">conditions of famine, under-nutrition, and general food insecurity.Rodman’s visit sheds some light onto a country we typically discuss in tones of either indignant condemnation or hushed mystery. We often underestimate the power of appealing to the human side of these mysterious figures. Rodman’s role was not and should not be as a diplomat or another U.S. sanctioned political figure. He attended not as a representative or ambassador of our country, but as a well-known basketball great playing along with a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/business/media/dennis-rodman-in-north-korea-with-vice-media-as-ringleader.html?pagewanted=all"">media ploy by the company “Vice” and the Harlem Globetrotters. He emerged with insights on the dictator and his personal life that not even our C.I.A. could profess to know, and that’s a tactic we forget to consider.  There is nobody at the C.I.A. who could tell you more personally about Kim Jong Un than Dennis Rodman, and that in itself is scary.We’re all human, and so we have public and private lives. People are different from the sensationalist depictions our media tends to feed us, and it thus becomes more important than ever to garner as many perspectives as possible. This is in no way a defense of the North Korean regime—the atrocities of prison camps and seemingly lack of regard for its citizens are inexcusable. However, it is important to understand that we all come from different upbringings and value systems; what Kim is doing (or not doing) is definitely wrong, but we need to understand why his imperial regime has been doing this, what the motivations are and the cultural biases that make him believe what he is doing is acceptable in any way. From a nationalistic point of view, North Korea is terrified of the super powers of the West that stand against them. It builds up its nuclear program and weapons because we have a far greater <a href=""http://ploughshares.org/world-nuclear-stockpile-report"">stockpile of nuclear weapons on our side. It is hard for us to judge unless we are there.
Rodman should not be prohibited from future visits to North Korea. In fact, he should be encouraged to do so and to share his experience, biased or not. His first visit and the ensuing public outcry will give him exposure to the public side of Kim, the dictator that we have grown to revile, but Rodman will be able also to provoke a new type of conversation about North Korea.So while the Rodman-Kim friendship may not be as deep as Rodman professes from his two day visit, it is a hopeful step towards gaining insight into a country and a man we know little about. Our media has built a perception of Kim as a power-hungry, emotionless dictator. And while the regimes and human rights abuses of Kim and his predecessors should be strongly condemned, it is also important to recognize Kim as only human. The man is not a myth or a legend, and we should not treat him as such.Kathy Wang ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is a government concentrator in Pforzheimer House.

Last Friday, the White House and Congress <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/us/politics/obama-meets-with-congress-leaders-as-spending-cuts-near.html?ref=politics"">failed to reach a deal to prevent drastic cuts in federal spending, indiscriminately slashing $85 billion of funding over the next seven months and $1.2 trillion over the next decade for domestic programs, research grants, and defense spending.Washington’s incompetence will likely <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/04/weve-reduced-the-deficit-and-hurt-the-short-term-economy/"">stymie the already lukewarm recovery, slowing growth by 0.6 percent and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/republicans-unveil-government-funding-bill-that-would-boost-military-readiness-protect-fbi/2013/03/04/227d26d4-8538-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html"">costing 750,000 jobs according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/us/politics/poor-face-most-pain-as-automatic-budget-cuts-take-effect.html?hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1362404316-SiM0GU+yo17Egvvi6WvPCw"">squeezes already underfunded and over-stretched public programs and may prevent the delivery of baby formula to low-income mothers, turn out 125,000 residents from public housing, and deny food and formula to 775,000 at-risk women and children. Despite <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/world/panetta-weighs-military-cuts-once-thought-out-of-bounds.html?pagewanted=all"">protests from senior Pentagon officials, funding to the Defense Department will be slashed by 7.8 percent. All this senseless cutting, purportedly designed to reduce long-term deficits, takes no action to address the two principal strains on the future budget: entitlement spending and the tax code.Despite objections from university presidents, including Harvard’s <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/27/Faust_Protests_Sequestration/"">Drew G. Faust, Congress severely cut funding to federal research agencies that provide much of the grant funding for basic research conducted at American colleges and universities that is vital for sustained, long-term economic growth. The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation will <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/25/university-braces-spending-cuts/"">reduce both the number of grants awarded and sharply cut award amounts, forcing labs across the country to cut back on research projects and spend more time applying for already competitive grants.Former NIH director Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/02/27/there-should-be-grandeur-basic-science-in-the-shadow-of-the-sequester/"">warns, “The most impacted are the young, new investigator scientists who…will now abandon the field of science. There will be a generational gap created.” Despite evidence that federal support of basic research has, according to the Congressional Budget Office, “a significantly positive return,” Congress unthinkingly sequestered research funding and clogged the pipeline of innovation critically needed for continuous economic growth.Rather than focusing on a byzantine tax code that allows Apple to pay <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html?pagewanted=all"">less than 10 percent to the federal government on its tremendous profits, or the <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/what-is-driving-growth-in-government-spending/"">astronomical  increase in entitlement spending, Congress is wrongly fixated on axing federal programs that undeniably benefit society at large, like basic research funding that drives growth or public programs that decrease poverty and inequality.
Most deplorably, the sequestration was never supposed to happen. The plan was originally designed during the equally irresponsible debt ceiling negotiations of August 2011 as a sword of Damocles so devastating that both parties could never let it continue.But Congress let the sword swing down on America.

At 7 p.m. last Friday evening at Lavietes Pavilion, with 33 straight Ivy League wins under their belt, the Princeton women’s basketball team seemed poised to move even closer to a fourth consecutive Ancient Eight crown. Senior Niveen Rasheed, the league’s leading scorer at 17 points per game, had led her team to victory in every conference game this season by an average margin of 33 points, and she showed no signs of slowing down anytime soon.  The Tigers looked unstoppable.But stoppable they certainly were. Over two halves, Harvard dismantled Princeton, holding their opponent to 25.8-percent shooting from the field, nearly 20 percent lower than their season average. Rasheed found herself suffocated by Crimson defenders, hitting just 3-of-12 field goal attempts.The last time the seniors of the Tiger squad, who had gone 50-1 in their Ivy careers to that point, saw a loss? Feb. 4, 2011. And the team that dealt this blemish to an otherwise perfect season? Harvard.One could dismiss this week’s upset victory as a fluke, an instance of a greater team simply choking. But this game really was a Crimson win, the materialization of an upward trend and a quest for vengeance.Rebounding from road losses at the Killer P’s and still mindful of a blowout at Dartmouth back in January, Harvard has played its past four games, all at home, to convincing wins.
Since the humbling 67-51 loss at Jadwin, the Crimson has shot at an average of 44.2 percent from the field and drilled over a quarter of its attempts from deep, even while missing standout three-point shooter Emma Golen. Junior guard Christine Clark has scored at least 14 points in each contest, while senior forward Victoria Lippert has broken the 20-point mark in three of the four games.But it has been far from a two-women show. Amidst a rash of injuries, Elle Hagedorn has stepped up as an athletic guard with the ability to beat practically any defender off the dribble. The senior has seen her playing time increased to nearly 30 minutes per contest over the past four games and taken advantage, grabbing boards and displaying much-improved ball control skills.In the frontcourt, forwards Miriam Rutzen and Temi Fagbenle have provided power on the glass. Fagbenle, in particular, has used her 6’4” frame to cut down opponents’ second chance shots with defensive rebounds.The Crimson has knocked visiting opponents off of their offensive games. Starting with Brown on Feb. 22, opponents’ shooting percentage has fallen steadily. In Harvard’s last outing, a convincing 67-54 win over the Quakers last Saturday, Crimson defenders stifled Penn to dismal 6.3-percent shooting late in the first half.But the team’s dominance in recent weeks isn’t adequately captured by improved statistics alone. The women of Harvard basketball have played with heart, with their coach Kathy Delaney-Smith frequently reminding them of how they’ve erred in the past.“We should have never lost to Penn the first time,” Delaney-Smith said. “We should have never lost to Dartmouth the second time. Those are huge errors we knew would come back to haunt us a little bit. But stranger things have happened; many Ivy champions have had three losses.”Previously facing a potential third place finish in the Ancient Eight, Harvard moved a step up the conference standings to second place this weekend, tied with Penn.The Crimson now faces three more Ivy tests, Cornell and Columbia twice. The race for the conference title has opened up a little for the first time in several years.Princeton left Cambridge evidently shaken by their scuffle with Harvard. The next night they traveled to Hanover and left with their slimmest margin of victory over a league opponent yet. Trailing at the half by three points, the Tigers fought for a narrow 68-60 win.For Harvard women’s basketball, the pieces fell into place this weekend to break Princeton and continue a streak of its own.—Staff writer Cordelia F.

James J. Watts ’10 was always up for an adventure—whether it be climbing mountains or unicycling around Widener Library.“The man was super excited about life,” said former blockmate Isaac S. Shivvers ’10-’11. “He was always excited to be doing what he was doing.”Watts—an avid mountaineer, loyal friend, and energetic student—passed away in an avalanche Friday while climbing Mt. Washington. He was 24.Once president of the Harvard Mountaineering Club, Watts loved sharing his passion for the outdoors with experienced and new climbers alike.“Jimmy was such a true leader, mentor, and friend to so many of us in the club,” said current HMC president Nick B. Waldo ’13 in an email to The Crimson. “It is hard to imagine what the current HMC would look like without him.”
Watts’ adventurous spirit extended into his everyday life, according to Shivvers. Watts created a bouldering route around his sophomore room and could traverse the suite without ever touching the ground. Friends especially remembered his willingness to take risks on behalf of others.During his junior year at Harvard, Watts took a semester off to work at a drug rehabilitation clinic in Mexico with patients who could not afford rehabilitative drugs.“He spent every single waking moment with the guy that was recovering from drug addiction,” said Carson H. Weitnauer, who interacted closely with Watts through the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship. “There was no money for drugs; they could only give love, presence, and prayers.”Indeed, faith was a central tenet of Watts’ life. He was involved in HRCF for all four years of college.“He pushed everyone to grow spiritually—to grow personally,” said Weitnauer. “Everyone wanted to become more of a Christian like he was.”Watts’ faith and his commitment to relationships kept him grounded despite a busy schedule at Harvard.“If we were going out to get food and take a break somewhere, he would join us whether he was hungry or not,” Shivvers said. “He was always willing to put other people in front of his own workload. I don’t think he ever made an enemy.”Throughout college, Watts dated his high school sweetheart Cassidy J. Ray, whom he married last spring.“Anyone who saw him with Cassidy, they knew that there was something tremendously special there,” said former blockmate Sam L. Linden ’10.Watts was a medical student at Columbia University when he died. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he wrote a thesis in Biochemical Sciences while working in a laboratory during his spare time.“He was a very eager student,” said biochemistry professor Jack L. Strominger, under whom Watts worked for four years. “Some students come to work in your lab because they think it will help them get into med school. That wasn’t Jimmy. He was really interested in doing research, always pushing to be independent.”Watts never gave up this excitement for new ideas.“With him gone, there’s a part of my future that won’t be there anymore,” Shivvers said. “He won’t be a part of these little adventures. That’s what I’m going to miss the most.”—Staff writer John A. Elzinga can be reached at jelzinga@college.harvard.edu.

This is what by-appointment office hours are for.  Q. I've been interested in this guy for almost three years now, but we've never had a real conversation. I see him practically every day, and now we're running out of time because we are both seniors. Any advice on how to approach and befriend him? A: We have a similar problem with a guy, in that we've been looking at pictures of Ryan Gosling practically every day for three years now and also have yet to have a real conversation with him.We won't judge you for sounding creepy, mostly because that would be hypocritical (but FYI you are a little bit creepy). Honestly though, it's senior spring. If we hadn't made fun of Twitter acronyms in our <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/column/listen-up/article/2013/2/26/listen-up-friend-zone/"">post last week, we would probably say YOLO or something. Since actually approaching him out of the blue would most likely be terrifying for both you and him, find a mutual friend to introduce you to <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">your target the guy. Make sure to floss before the big moment and—BAM!—your life will now change forever. Jk. But it will be something to look forward to other than reading the HUDS menu daily and praying for a miracle. Q: How do I get a boyfriend? It's so hard to date at Harvard. —Lonelygirl

With one day to go until administrators and representatives of University Health Services sit down at Thursday's much-anticipated ""Mental Health Town Hall,"" students are refining, submitting, and voting on questions that aim to demystify Harvard's mental health resources and procedures.<!--more-->The Undergraduate Council-sponsored event—which features a panel of guests, including representatives of the AdBoard, Harvard Mental Health Services, the Financial Aid Office, the Office of Student Life, and Student Mental Health Liaisons—will run from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday in Emerson 105.According to Paul J. Barreira, director of University Health Services, the panel will be moderated by a neutral facilitator, and though there may be some matters of fact presented at the event, the majority of time will be devoted to open question and response.Questions already submitted via a UC-promoted <a href=""https://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=201b45"">Google Doc touch on a wide-range of mental health issues, from the availability of self-help books to the scope of confidentiality between students, UHS, and the administration.Here, in order, are the top five questions as of Wednesday afternoon:
1. How does Harvard plan to improve the system for student advocates during the AdBoard process in light of recent academic and health concerns?2. What rights and limits of confidentiality exist between the student and UHS, tutors and residential staff, and the Ad Board? How can we increase transparency?3. Would the university consider subsidizing mental health costs for those on a leave of absence who met full-financial aid requirements? Extending our student plans currently costs &gt;$1000, which may be significant burden starting off on leave.4. The system at Harvard works with the extremes, meaning healthy students thrive &amp; students about to commit suicide can be seen overnight. How does Harvard plan to address the middle - so students aren't forced to get worse before they can get better?5. Will Harvard commit to abolishing the de facto policy of persuading students to take leave of absence, except where medically necessary?""Check TheCrimson.com for updates.

New York Times columnist and former Crimson news editor Nicholas D. Kristof ’81 described what he sees as the three major challenges in the field of journalism Tuesday night after accepting the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism at the Harvard Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy Jr. forum.The first challenge Kristof addressed was what he called the “evaporating” business model of journalism. He said that news agencies must be more innovative if they want to “dominate the new landscape ahead.”Kristof said that he believes established journalism institutions that feel as though they are doing important work tend to be overly careful.“I think we probably do need to be more experimental,” he said.To keep journalists who are doing important work in the field, Kristof said, “We have to figure out how to make money.”
The second challenge Kristof referenced was what he termed a U.S. retreat from “the rest of the world,” motivated in part by the economic downturn and by a general “weariness with Iraq [and] Afganistan.”Kristof labeled the “rising distrust for the news media” as journalism’s third major challenge. In a time when news organizations are more polarized and publish inaccuracies twice as many times as in 1995, Kristoff said that a focus on ethics is more important than ever.Alex S. Jones, Director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, and a New York Times reporter, called the Goldsmith Awards event a “highlight” for American journalism.Alongside Kristof, the Shorenstein Center awarded Goldsmith book prizes to writers Jonathan M. Ladd and Rebecca MacKinnon.Thomas E. Patterson, Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at the Kennedy School, said that the Goldsmith Awards are set apart from other journalistic awards by the “expressed intent that the journalism be aimed at improving how the government works.”Six finalists were recognized for their success in achieving this goal in investigative reporting. The Chicago Tribune’s Patricia Callahan, Sam Roe, and Michael Hawthorne were recognized for their series, “Playing with Fire,” and won the $25,000 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting.-Staff writer Zohra D.

By my count, the clothes that I’m currently wearing have six pockets between them. Are any of them useful? Absolutely not.In women’s clothes today, there is a distressing trend of aesthetic pockets rather than useful ones. Men’s clothes are positively riddled with pockets, with the exception of socks and underwear—because that would be weird. These pockets are wonderful, deep, capacious compartments which fit literally everything: phones, keys, wallets, small notepads, larger notepads, legal sized notepads, and an assortment of healthy snacks. My father is able to keep all of this in his pockets, plus a smaller jacket, which has even more pockets.In contrast, I might be able to squeeze a slightly chewed piece of gum into the front pocket of my jeans. That is, if I didn’t mind the stickiness, which I do. Don’t even get me started on the back pockets. Theoretically, these are the pockets that are supposed to fit your phone and wallet. Dream big. Putting a phone in your back pocket is straight up asking for it to get flipped out into a toilet or a particularly sticky final club floor. The same risk is associated with women’s wallets—which incidentally are the size of baguettes (and go poorly with brie).The impracticality of women’s pockets does not stop there. The chest pocket, the most frustrating pocket of them all, has absolutely no purpose other than to perch on top of our boobs and remind us that all of our pockets are useless. To be fair they do make nice finger warmers. But what do I have that fits in there besides my pinky? Nothing. What do I need to carry around? Everything.It makes no sense that women, who, as romantic comedies have shown, carry around an inordinate amount of stuff, have pointless pockets, while men literally have small caves in their clothes for whatever phones, keys, and actual baguettes they happen to have.
The only solutions to this problem are buying bags, which are annoyingly expensive, or stashing items in your décolletage.And while this may be convenient, pulling your baguette out of your cleavage is not all that appetizing.

Revisions to Harvard’s planned relocation of campus services to 28 Travis Street in North Allston were met with mixed reactions at a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Tuesday night.Residents also voiced concern over what they called unsatisfactory and ambiguous plans for improvements to Rena Park and the mixed-use development at Barry’s Corner.Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, began the meeting by presenting six modifications meant to address community concerns over the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/allston-task-campus-services/"">relocation of mailroom services, Harvard University Information Technology, Harvard University Police Department training, recycling and storage, and “fleet management services” from 219 Western Avenue to 28 Travis Street. The proposed plan for the project and for the residential and retail commons at Barry’s Corner is slated to go before the Boston Redevelopment Authority board next week.“My hope is that most of you, if not all of you, will feel comfortable... with Harvard moving forward with the relocation project,” Casey said.The changes Casey announced included the elimination of Harvard traffic on Travis Street, a commitment to begin planning for Rena Park next month, shuttle access for Allston residents, and a promise to find a suitable location for the Ed Portal in Barry’s Corner.
“[The plan] has been improved by all of your feedback,” Casey said.After Casey’s presentation, Allston residents expressed concerns that the changes did not address issues like the disruptive sounds emitted by Harvard vehicles.Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alfred criticized Harvard’s plan to operate the facility throughout the night. But Carl Tempesta, Harvard’s associate director of transit, fleet, and charter, responded that the University plans to construct a new building on Travis Street, which will serve as a noise buffer for the neighborhood. He also said that traffic late at night and early in the morning will be minimal.Task force members also took issue with Harvard’s promise to “revisit” 28 Travis Street as the suitable location for campus services once the construction of the Allston Science <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/6/seas-move-allston-campus/"">Complex is finished.“Those totally nebulous terms offer me no assurance whatsoever,” task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said. “The term ‘revisit’ doesn’t tell me a thing.”Casey responded by saying that the University and task force could change the wording of the proposal before it is reviewed by the BRA board on March 14. However, Casey said that it will be hard to assess the location’s suitability until the science complex is completed.“We want to make sure there’s a certainty of what’s going to happen,” task force chair Ray V. Mellone said.The members of the task force recommended approval of the Travis Street relocation under three additional conditions, the first of which was that Harvard agree not to put campus services on or near residential streets. Additionally, the task force requested that Harvard complete construction on Rena Park and move campus services away from Travis Street by the time the science complex is occupied in <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/19/allston-plan-master-official/"">2018.Despite the critique of Harvard’s proposal, some task force members said that they appreciated the University’s attempts to move toward a compromise.“I thought that your presentation addressed a multitude of things that we are concerned about,” Mellone said. “We’re almost there and I would hate to see us not get there.”The Travis Street relocation is part of a larger plan for development of Harvard’s property in Allston, including a new basketball arena, a hotel and conference center, and the renovation of Harvard Stadium.—Staff writer Marco J.

Government professor Michael J. Sandel and University of Chicago professor Jean Bethke Elshtain discussed the role of religion in public life on Tuesday in front of a crowd of more than 500 students and community members in Sanders Theater.Moderated by Christopher D. Hampson ‘09, the forum gave the professors 15 minutes each to speak about their own opinions on the topic. The talk was followed by a question and answer session between the panelists and then with the audience.The event was sponsored by The Veritas Forum, a national Christian group “dedicated to the exploration of big questions.” The organization has the mantra that “big questions are best explored together,” according to Terrance Moore ’14 in opening remarks.“This is an opportunity to take our differences seriously in light of the hardest questions,” Moore said. “Our hope is that everyone will be challenged on both intellectual and spiritual grounds.”Both Elshtain and Sandel agreed on the importance of incorporating religious beliefs in academic and every-day discourse.
Elshtain, who said she had been criticized for using too many religious references in her work, said it was impossible to separate her public or professional identity from her faith.“It turns out that what I thought I had rejected had lived on and rose forth in manifold ways,” she said.Elshtain added that without incorporating religious lessons in all realms of life, “We become more stupid and lose contact with forces that for better or worse made us who we are as persons.”Sandel agreed with most of Elshtain’s assertions. Like Elshtain, Sandel also disputed the notion that moral and religious convictions should be kept separate from public discourse.“This view is a mistake,” Sandel said. “It is a mistake for two reasons. First because it’s not always possible to bracket or set aside these views. And second, even in those aspects of public life where we could bracket, doing so would cut ourselves off...from a range of considerations that often matter in the way we govern our lives together.”Sandel added that incorporating religious views in public discourse would make for a higher level of discourse and a better kind of democratic citizenship.Brian R. Gifford ’13 said that he agreed with Sandel and Elshtain.“I’m a Christian, and I’m hoping to do some missionary work abroad next year,” Gifford said. “I found myself in agreement that there needs to be a space to talk to each other about what we believe and even try to persuade each other because that will only help us find truth.”J. C. Lewis, a local journalist, echoed Gifford’s sentiment.“Religion informs so much of the history of our consciousness,” he said. “The idea that you could banish it simply makes no sense.”—Staff writer Pooja Podugu can be reached at podugu@college.harvard.edu.

School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray said that she anticipates a 30 percent growth in the size of the SEAS faculty over the next 10 to 15 years.“We’re going to be doing a huge amount of hiring,” Murray said, adding that she expects SEAS to add 20 full-time equivalent positions to the tenured and tenure-track faculty.SEAS currently has 67 tenured faculty members and 16 tenure-track faculty members, who collectively work for as much time as would an equivalent of 66.45 full-time faculty members.Murray emphasized that when adding the 20 faculty positions, SEAS would also need to make up for retirements.“To grow 20, I expect we’re going to hire 50,” Murray said. “This is just looking at the age of the faculty and the number who leave for one reason or another.”
SEAS has three confirmed hires—Shmuel Rubinstein, Jelani Nelson, and Yaron Singer—who will be joining the faculty in July. SEAS will also recognize the retirements of two faculty members—Michael O. Rabin and Peter P. Rogers—in May.The number of full-time equivalents among SEAS faculty has grown by almost 50 percent since July 1998, when there were 44 full-time equivalents. Yet Murray said the faculty size needs to continue to grow to keep up with the number of undergraduate <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/13/cs-seas-more-concentrators/"">concentrators. Since 2009, the SEAS faculty has not grown, while the number of undergraduate concentrators has expanded by 70 percent.Area Dean for Applied Physics Eric Mazur recognized the possibility of hiring additional faculty to help develop an applied physics concentration, but said that such plans are contingent on SEAS resolving its space needs.“Right now, there’s very little extra space for hires, especially since most applied physicists are experimentalists and need a lab,” Mazur said. “So I think a lot of the hiring will depend on what happens to space, which is connected to the possibility of moving to Allston.”Last month, University President Drew G. Faust told The <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/6/seas-move-allston-campus/"">Crimson that SEAS will relocate to Allston in as few as five years.In an interview with The Crimson on Friday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that the move to Allston would provide room for SEAS to expand and hire new faculty members.“The number of students taking SEAS courses has grown rapidly, [which] has placed huge demands on SEAS faculty,” Garber said. “Allston offers us the opportunity to give the SEAS faculty space to grow, to have state of the art facilities, and to some extent to bring SEAS faculty together.”More immediately, SEAS will begin relocating some of its administrative staff to a new location in Harvard Square starting next <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/seas-moves-allston-square/"">month, according to an announcement from SEAS Executive Dean G. Timothy Bowman.While growth remains a priority for the school, Area Dean for Electrical Engineering Evelyn Hu said she expects the hiring process to be carefully planned around cutting-edge research and undergraduate interest in different concentrations.“Although SEAS hopes to and expects to grow in the next few years, I don’t think it’s anyone’s intention to grow carelessly and unconstrained,” Hu said. “The strength of an engineering program at Harvard is to focus on...what we do best and how we can grow in a way that is thoughtful and that adds value.”—Staff writer Brian C.

Two Harvard-owned apartment buildings on Prescott Street are slated to become part of swing housing for students during the next wave of House Renewal, forcing current residents to relocate.Residents of 20-20A and 22-24 Prescott Street must vacate their units by Feb. 1, 2014, according to a letter from Harvard University Housing. The buildings will be used for Dunster swing housing in 2014.During its Monday night meeting, the City Council reviewed a complaint letter from a Ware Street resident, who protested the University’s decision to turn apartment buildings into swing space for the College and calling on the Council to intervene.By unanimous consent, the Council referred the matter to the city’s University Relations Committee for further investigation.According to the complaint letter, the two buildings on Prescott Street account for a total of 80 apartments.
“The overall reduction in the number of available housing units in the city, especially in [the] Harvard Square area, evokes all the problems attendant upon a real-life version of the game of musical chairs,” the letter reads.The letter expressed particular concern for tenants living in rent control units.Even though the state of Massachusetts eliminated rent control in 1996, Harvard still had several tenants leasing rent controlled units. When the city of Cambridge questioned Harvard about the fate of these tenants, the University decided to allow them to remain in a rent control system.“Under the swing housing program, each of the tenants of the seven former rent control units are being assisted with finding equivalent housing in another Harvard-owned facility at the same rent as they were paying previously,” Harvard spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson. “In addition to helping these tenants find another unit in the Harvard University Housing portfolio, Harvard will also reimburse these tenants for moving-related expenses.”Of these tenants, those who wish to lease in buildings outside of the Harvard University Housing portfolios will also receive assistance from Harvard in finding other housing, Neal wrote.Harvard is giving all residents first pick in lotteries for Harvard-owned units.But residents said that they are worried because housing is not guaranteed.“It’s like a competition because all the people who live here [in this building] are looking for Harvard Housing,” Prescott Street resident Alejandra Bueno said. Bueno, who lives with three roommates, said that she is also worried about finding good housing for four people.Bronwyn C. Roantree, a College Fellow in the Committee on the Study of Religion, has been living on Prescott Street for the past six years.“It’s a disruption for me, but it’s not traumatic,” Roantree said. “The people whom I am most concerned about...are older and have been living here for 35, 40 years.”—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

The cozy feeling behind snowy tunes like ""Baby It’s Cold Outside"" and ""Let It Snow"" only lasts several days past Christmas.

This one involves stairs, but for those of us headed to CGIS or the Art Museum from the Yard, it pays to head downstairs and cut across Memorial Hall for a quick warm cut.

Humanities concentrators should be jealous. Somehow, the Mallinckrodt Lab just happens to be built as one of the longest warm cuts on campus: it runs along Oxford Street beginning from the Science Center and ending seemingly never.

George Saunders’s “Tenth of December,” his latest short story collection, was hailed as “the best thing you’ll read this year” on the cover of The New York Times Magazine. His agent has agreed to give FM a strict 30 minutes of his time, but Saunders, with his Chicago accent and self-described “Pollyanna-ish” familiarity, isn’t a stickler; we’re pushing 90 when he requests a two-minute break to chase his runaway dog.1. Fifteen Minutes: In many of the stories in “Tenth of December,” you place your characters in moral dilemmas and watch as they puzzle through them. How do you embed explicit moral structures without condescending?George Saunders: The thing is to come up with a dilemma that’s really complicated, so the reader goes, “Hmm, I don’t know what I would do.” Then just let the story be one answer to the question. The technical difficulty lies in posing a moral question that’s really interesting. So you come up with this idea that there’s a couple named Romeo and Juliet, and they’re really hot for each other. That’s not a story yet. But then you see yourself looking for an obstacle or an obstruction because that’s where the interest lies. If you claim that this couple is in love, for me it goes, “Oh, really? Then prove it.” Then you go, “Oh, I can prove it, I’ll make it difficult for them.” Their families hate each other. That’s how what people call the moralizing element gets in there.2. FM: Did you always write that way?GS: Yeah. When I was younger, I used to make more of an attempt to have more of a conceptual underpinning for what I was doing. But then I got into a fix where nothing I was writing was any good. I wasn’t even interested in it. I came around to this more radical way of thinking: The way to get your best self into a piece of fiction is to really really concentrate on the line-by-line charm of your prose. The whole world is contained in your first sentence, and that’s a little bit too much pressure, but it’s true. Everything you’re going to bring to a story as a writer, the only way you’re going to do it is a sentence at a time.
3. FM: Do you have a favorite first sentence from your writing?GS: Not really. I’m big on functionality, so in the first sentence all I’m trying to do is get you to take one step into the room. The only way anyone ever reads a story is a sentence at a time. It’s like a linear, temporal experience. So you just try to keep the reader feeling honored and continuing to read, and that approach for me contained everything that there was—all the politics, all the themes.4. FM: Politics are central to much of your work. Why?GS: I’m a pretty straight up liberal and so I’ll have all the usual reactions to Republicans, but at some point you get bored with that and wonder, is there a more sophisticated answer? I’m trying to get to the more human aspect of it. Opinions are what we do to assure ourselves that we are alive.5. FM: So how do you try and understand other opinions?GS: I think that’s fiction. Let’s put these people in stories. Al Rooster is a guy like that in “Tenth of December.” I wouldn’t like him naturally, but then I got to be inside his head for a year. You start digging around and seeing the ways that you are similar, which is not surprising because you are inventing him. Even liberals have conservative impulses. Let’s say you are a liberal person and you meet a girl at a party who’s had nine abortions and is like, “I don’t give a shit.” You’re going to respond like, “what!?” Part of you even wants to abolish abortion so that someone like that can’t live that way. That’s a conservative impulse. You just think “Oh I’m George, and I’m a liberal, so when I have a conservative thought I squash it.” But as a fiction writer you have the incredible liberty to not have to do that.6. FM: You wrote a “Shouts and Murmurs” humor piece for the New Yorker earlier this year from the perspective of Ayn Rand’s former lover. You mentioned in an interview that before you took to mocking her, you were a fan. How did your politics evolve? Is Rand still an influence in any way?GS: No, I can’t stand her. I was trying to decide whether to go to college through Atlas Shrugged. That was the first novel I’d read in many years, and I really loved it. That was very intoxicating stuff—that following your own impulses was the most holy thing in the world. What 18-year-old doesn’t want to hear that? I was just a working-class boy, and I hadn’t done very well in high school so my options for college were very limited. It was nice to hear that I was right all along after all. I’m grateful because I wouldn’t have gone to college if I hadn’t read that book. I was just sort of re-energized the way I thought about myself. I thought, “I, Me, George, could be on a college campus with friends!” So even though it was kind of a hateful book, I think, and completely, completely wrongheaded, it came to me at the right moment and made a big difference.7. FM: “Tenth of December” has been called more mature and less zany than a lot of your earlier work. Do you think that’s accurate?GS: I’m a little less zany than I used to be. I think it’s more like focused zaniness. You go to a party, and you have 12 beers, and you say something stupid. Then, at the next party, on beer eight, you go, “Huh, I remember that 12 was a bad decision; maybe I should stop.” I think art is like that. You write four or five books, and every time you’re wearing out certain approaches and trying out new ones and refining those.

“I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat,” Churchill famously declaimed, in a staunch metaphor of national and human resolve. For <a href=""http://www.kent.edu/uhs/upload/formattedmsm_goldberg_gates.pdf"">over seven million American men, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Association has left item number one off that list.In a <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm"">policy that has persisted since 1983, the FDA has maintained a lifetime ban on blood donation by men who have had sex with other men. Before improvements in HIV detection, FDA censorship may have made scientific or actuarial sense, but that erstwhile rationale gave way some time ago. Encouragingly, anti-ban opinion has gradually snowballed with support: A recent letter-writing <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/1/campaign-protest-blood-donation/"">campaign, spearheaded by the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies and the Harvard Libertarian Forum, is an especially bright embodiment of that trend.Their voices follow a growing chorus from the field of medicine itself. The American Medical Association, America’s Blood Centers, and the Red Cross itself, to name three particularly <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-16/national/35453125_1_blood-safety-and-availability-blood-banks-human-services-advisory-committee"">weighty <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/sexual-and-reproductive-health/articles/2010/06/11/us-weighs-lifting-ban-on-gay-men-as-blood-donors"">examples, have formally endorsed removing the lifetime restriction. Modern technology now permits effective <a href=""http://www.aabb.org/pressroom/statements/Pages/bpacdefernat030906.aspx"">screening of blood for HIV within 10 to 21 days of disease contraction, and although the FDA cites worries regarding this “window period,” a human lifetime is a draconian confidence interval to enforce. A robust <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/world/europe/09briefs-Britain.html?_r=0"">slate of nations worldwide—England, South Africa, Japan, and many more—agree, and have no lifetime ban in place.The proscription, of course, might be justified even in the face of inefficacy. The Hippocratic maxim, “Do no harm,” would seem to justify caution. Except that the ban does do harm. For one, it limits the scope of blood donations. Ending the restriction would not spur a long-term effusion of blood donors, but it would provide badly needed help. One study <a href=""http://www.kent.edu/uhs/upload/formattedmsm_goldberg_gates.pdf"">predicts an increase as high as 1.4 percent in the effective donor pool. That may sound on the paltry side, but with the Red Cross reporting its lowest blood donation <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-07-28/nationwide-blood-shortage/56545264/1"">level in 15 years last summer, any meaningful increase in donations is sure to translate to real results at the human level. It is a bitter, ironic scene: a medical establishment scrambling to combat a donation shortage, while a dusty government ban outlaws charity to ameliorate it.And even beyond the utilitarian math, the policy is simply discriminatory. Shorn of its scientific basis, it serves only to limit a historically marginalized cohort from a basic, noble exercise in freedom and dignity. As we <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/12/18/fda-discrimination-must-end-as-harvard/"">wrote on the issue over a decade ago—even then, the ban was a vestige—yet still must reiterate today, “Personal history is the pertinent information; blind predetermination based on orientation is not.”
The picture does have its bright spots, however, albeit not in the FDA’s interdiction itself. The Harvard campus displayed an episode of broad-based fervor and effort, in a campaign that elicited letters for the FDA from roughly one-fourth of the College’s student body. It also marked a potent case study in cooperation among student groups: Its success came as the fruit of collaboration between the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies and the Harvard Libertarian Forum. The spirits of cooperation and working together may sound trite or simplistic. But 1,624 letters say otherwise.We hope that efforts like the joint one on campus and its national counterparts will engender an end to the FDA ban. In the telling (if understating) <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/06/health/gay-men-blood-ban"">words of an independent panel commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services, the current blanket policy is “suboptimal.” The FDA should make it optimal.

Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement brought the Allston debate into Harvard Yard Wednesday in a community forum led by a panel of Harvard-Allston Task Force members and community development experts.Harvard undergraduates, staff, Allston residents, and members of the broader community gathered at the Phillips Brooks House to discuss Harvard’s role and responsibilities in Allston.No representatives from the Harvard administration attended the event.To kick off the discussion, which was dubbed “Parks or Parking Lots?”, Task Force member and Allston resident Brent C. Whelan ’73 recounted the history of the relationship between the University and the neighborhood. He stressed what he perceives as the lack of transparency with which Harvard has extended its land holdings in Allston and said that Harvard has placed little emphasis on community benefits in its development plans.In 2007, Harvard filed an institutional master plan for Allston development, which included designs for the construction of a $1 billion dollar science complex and the redevelopment of the area surrounding the intersection of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street, known as Barry’s Corner. However, the University halted construction in Allston in 2009 because of financial constraints, a decision that sparked outrage among Allston residents.
In 2012, Harvard announced it would be <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/12/new-blueprint-for-allston/"">restarting development in Allston and that it would include Allston community members in its new planning process.But according to Whelan, between 2010 and 2011, when the planning for Harvard’s development in Allston restarted, the wishes of Allston residents were not considered.“Absolutely no community representation was allowed into that process,” he said.Harry E. Mattison, another panelist and Task Force member, pointed to the University’s plan to move campus services to 28 Travis St. as an example of Harvard’s lack of commitment to community interests. The relocation has been <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/allston-task-campus-services/"">extensively debated at recent Task Force meetings. Mattison said that Harvard had promised to place a three-acre park where Barry’s Corner meets the residential community, but that the University is now reneging on that promise.“You can imagine our dismay to see the Travis Street project be the first project Harvard will complete,” he said.Panelist Pallavi K. Mande, director of the Charles River Watershed Association’s Blue Cities program, said that Harvard has a responsibility to develop its property in a sustainable way. Mande, whose Blue Cities work includes the design and implementation of green infrastructure projects, described the negative environmental effects of covering large plots of land in asphalt. She said that the Watershed Association has recommended that Harvard replace some asphalt lots with parks.“[Harvard does] claim to be a university that believes in environmental sustainability,” she said. “It’s just a matter of making sure that the community’s interests are part of these goals.”Alex L. Chen ’16, a member of SLAM and one of the organizers of the event, said that Mattison approached SLAM in February about creating an opportunity for College and Allston community members to come together. While SLAM focuses primarily on labor issues at Harvard, Chen said the group was happy to coordinate with Mattison.“It’s just important to be engaged with how the University is interacting with the community,” Chen said.­—Staff writer Marco J.

As Harvard School of Public Health professor Myron “Max” Essex begins his day in his office in Boston, his mind is already thousands of miles away. Essex—a renowned immunobiologist and virologist—spends much of his time on conference calls with partners in Botswana, chairing the Harvard-Botswana Partnership for HIV/AIDS research from afar.Since the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, Essex has focused his career on researching the disease. His discovery that HIV is a retrovirus earned him the Lasker Award, one of the most prestigious prizes in the medical field.Today, Botswana­—a small nation in southern Africa­—is the object of almost all of Essex’s research.As in many countries in the region, HIV/AIDS remains a dramatic problem in Botswana. But, thanks in part to the Harvard’s collaboration with the government, conditions on the ground have improved in the past decade as the partnership employs methods that combine vaccination, prevention efforts, and treatment.‘THERE TO HELP’
In 1996, executive director of Harvard’s AIDS Initiative Richard G. Marlink worked with Essex to forge a partnership between Harvard and the Botswanan government using a framework that had been implemented in similar programs in Senegal, Tanzania, the former Zaire, and Nigeria. Since the 1980s the AIDS Initiative—a program dedicated to AIDS research—had operated as an extension of the School of Public Health.But the situation in Botswana was different than that in the Initiative’s other base countries. The infection rate of the small, sparsely populated country in southern Africa was higher than that of most of its counterparts and showed no signs of leveling off.Seeing this anomaly led Essex to hypothesize that the strain of AIDS affecting southern Africa, specifically Botswana, was a different type than the typical strain encountered in the United States or other parts of Africa.The Botswana-Harvard Partnership began to expand rapidly between 2000 and 2001. Today, more than 250 people work in the partnership, most of them Botswanan researchers, technicians, and support staff. The organization is based on the campus of the Princess Marina Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Botswana.Describing the spirit and strategy of the endeavor, Marlink explained three stringent rules for employees that have allowed the partnership to operate successfully over the years.“We want this relationship to be almost familial,” he said. “This is their country, their money, and they will be able to implement solutions to the problem in the most sustainable way possible. We are only there to help.”REDUCING THE NUMBERSThe Harvard-Botswana Partnership’s research procedure is complex and varied, according to Essex, and is unified only by its reliance on asking questions that have thus far remained unanswered.“We have done research on pregnant women almost since day one,” Essex said. “Over time we’ve perfected combinations of drugs—free drugs—to give to pregnant women starting at the beginning of the third trimester.”The success of the strategies developed by Essex and his team have been recognized by international organizations. The World Health Organization adopted guideline recommendations developed by the team to reduce maternal transmission of HIV in developing countries, according to the Harvard AIDS Initiative’s website.

To the editor:I am disappointed that The Crimson has not apologized for but instead <a href=""http://freebeacon.com/awkward-harvard-crimson-president-flounders-under-heat-of-oreilly/"">continues to <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2013/03/02/harvard-crimson-president-defends-editorial-urging-some-conservatives-not-to-enroll-video/"">defend its juvenile editorial <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/28/do-not-enroll/"">warning conservatives not to enroll at Harvard. Although The Crimson claims that the article’s purpose was to highlight the hypocrisy among alumni who wish to “score political points by maligning Harvard,” the article fails to actually make this argument.Instead, The Crimson explicitly warns conservatives to stay away from Cambridge on the grounds that students who are critical of Harvard should “neither apply, enroll, nor graduate from this fine institution.” The article’s logic is embarrassing, and the belittling and disparagement of conservative students is repugnant.The editorial rests on the false assumptions that solely conservative students disagree with the University and that dissent is inherently problematic. There are countless examples of Harvard’s liberal students and alumni expressing discontent with the University. By its own logic, The Crimson’s message should also apply to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/al-gore-climate-change/"">Al Gore, who has praised the student campaign challenging the University’s investment in fossil fuels. Furthermore, the editors surely recognize that criticism can play a valuable role in righting wrongs. They certainly wouldn’t condemn alumni who disagreed and criticized Harvard for its past exclusion of women and minorities and much less deem them “episodes of treachery.” As a Hispanic female, I might not be studying at Harvard today were it not for vocal critics of past Harvard policies.Perhaps the most arrogant and disrespectful claim in the article is the characterization of conservatives as “anti-intellectual.” The name-calling itself reveals the real anti-intellectualism at Harvard. It is not typically found among its conservatives, whose ideas and arguments are sharpened by constant scrutiny and criticism. Rather, it is found in the intolerance toward conservatives on campus and in the failure to engage the arguments and principles that guide conservative beliefs.
In this respect, this editorial is not an outlier, but only the most brazen recent example of the preference for mindless bullying over authentic discussion. Many of Harvard’s students recognize the value and necessity of intellectual diversity, but it is discouraging to see that our campus’s newspaper does not.In a few weeks, students from across the globe will find out whether they have been accepted into Harvard’s Class of 2017. I urge The Crimson to reconsider its welcome message. Conservatives remain an integral part of Harvard, and they are encouraged to apply and enroll.Luciana E. Milano ’14Cambrdge, Mass.To the editor:I teach an upper-level undergraduate statistics class, Statistics 123: “Applied Quantitative Finance on Wall Street,” which has averaged an enrollment of approximately 100 students a term. The course is substantive and difficult (I demand Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability” as a prerequisite), introduces subtle and elegant theory, and challenges students to tackle new ways of thinking. The midterm and final exams (closed-book, proctored) are demanding and stretch students’ mastery of the material.In my class I have met varsity football players, computer science prodigies, a gifted conductor now at Juilliard, a European math Olympiad finalist, writers for The Crimson, cross country runners, violinists, golf stars, and fencers, among a wide range of Harvard students.These students all share the drive and motivation to add knowledge, to understand the subtleties of complex concepts, and to tackle difficult topics head on. They do not want to shirk the acquisition of knowledge for an easy grade. Rather, they are motivated to master the most challenging material they can, and they take delight in their own intellectual progress. It is an unqualified joy to teach such students and to see them respond to and engage with demanding subject matter.There is much we can all do better. But let us not be afraid to say, clearly and loudly, “academics flourish at Harvard.”Stephen BlythCambridge, Mass.

Part of a series of ongoing coverage on Venezuela following the death of President Hugo Chávez.On March 5, the day the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela announced the death of its president, Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías, the sky over the city of Mérida darkened into an uncharacteristic gray. The Andean sun, shining in the clear morning blue as it had been for the past three weeks, passed behind the clouds in the early afternoon and remained there through 5 p.m., when Vice President Nicolás Maduro made the announcement, choking back tears. At the institute for my study abroad program, we were told instantly to go home for fear of looting, riots, and problems with Americans. I decided to take a long route home through the city.Mérida is the capital of one of just two states that voted against Chávez in the October elections. It is known as a center of the opposition, and the tension in the streets was palpable. Two women ran down a sidewalk screaming, “He's dead! He's dead!” “At last!” shouted a man driving by on his motorcycle, his shirt removed. “At last, we’re free!”

Others, gathered in groups, exchanged words about the government's deception: how Chávez had likely been dead for some time and the vice president had only decided to make it official for strategic reasons. They made repeated references to Cuba and Fidel Castro. On the bus I caught to the city center, the Venezuelan national anthem abruptly interrupted blasting reggaeton music. In the seat across from me, a young woman fought back tears with the comfort of her boyfriend; behind me, two teenagers snickered. Suddenly, at a red light near the military battalion, a guard rushed over and handed our bus driver a folded piece of white paper, an order that we couldn't continue. While a line formed for people to pay their fare, about half the bus slipped out the back door.  We were not told the reason for that order, but it became clear as I walked with the crowd towards the city center.  Though it was just 20 minutes after Maduro's announcement, all schools and businesses had already closed down. Their owners dangled their keys as they walked away from their bar-enclosed storefronts in the opposite direction, joined by mothers tightly grasping their children.I had seen few police cars during my previous seven weeks in Mérida, but at least 10 now passed through the streets along with many motorcycles, some of them speeding through on the wrong side of the street. They all converged at the Plaza Bolívar, the heart of the city and the location of many chavista rallies in the spirit of the plaza's namesake. The most recent one, held 15 days before, had celebrated the president’s return from Cuba.Now, freshly-decorated murals hung by the grass, and along the sidewalk stretched a white piece of paper on which citizens had written personal messages to the fallen president. Some wished him peace and happiness, declaring that he would remain, with reference to his election campaign, the heart of the Venezuelan people; others professed their everlasting love. One person from the nearby city of El Vigía left a message consisting, mysteriously, only of a phone number.A stage had been erected in front of the city’s government building where six people spoke fervently to the somber crowd of about 500, clad in red. They led several popular chants emphasizing their identification with their leader (“todos somos Chávez”; “we are all Chávez”) and his continued presence, which would now remain in spirit (“¡uh! ¡ah! ¡Chávez no se va!”; “Chávez won't go!”). Then, in an appeal to overcome the tragedy, they called upon the collective unity that Chavez had fostered among the people. Behind them stood a line of police officers and paramedics, waiting at attention beside an ambulance.The leading speakers now shifted their rhetoric to “The Empire” of the “yanquis” (or yankees), rousing loud cheers. Considering my appearance and accent, I decided to head back home.

HarvardX, a branch of Harvard and MIT’s joint virtual learning venture edX, will be a priority for Harvard’s upcoming capital campaign, University President Drew G. Faust told The Crimson on Wednesday.“We feel that we have the privilege of undertaking this campaign at a time when there are some extremely important things happening in higher education,” Faust said, in reference to the growing significance of online learning at academic institutions.<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/2/mit-edx-virtual-online/"">Launched last May with $30 million apiece from Harvard and MIT, edX allows anyone in the world to enroll in select courses offered by faculty at some of the world’s most prestigious universities at no cost. The platform <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/20/edx-international-six-schools/"">has since expanded to include 12 colleges and universities from three continents.Faust said that in addition to traditional priorities, Harvard’s capital campaign—now in its quiet phase but scheduled to go live this fall—will also seek to target more cutting-edge trends in teaching and learning.“It’s not just a matter of strengthening our pillars of existence like financial aid and faculty, which we certainly will have as priorities in the campaign, but there are new things happening in the world of higher education, and the digital environment is one,” Faust said.
At a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/5/edx-funding-virtual-independent/"">virtual education conference on Monday, edX President and MIT professor Anant Agarwal said that the organization would seek additional sources of revenue in order to remain non-profit without burdening its institutional partners.At the conference, Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that in addition to the original $30 million investment, the University incurs costs for each new course that it offers on the edX platform.In the long term, he said, “our intent [is] that this is a self-sustaining activity that does not depend on ongoing philanthropic support.”For now, however, the University is soliciting contributions for edX as part of the capital campaign, and Faust said that some donors are excited about helping fund the online platform.“They see it as transformational,” Faust said. “They’ve looked at what the digital revolution has done for other sectors of the economy, other industries, and they think we have a chance to have a real impact here with edX.”—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nikitakansra@college.harvard.edu.

Long before edX began offering Harvard courses online, the Harvard Extension School has provided open-enrollment courses to those seeking an education outside of the typical undergraduate timeframe. The Extension School, which was founded in 1910, opens up the University’s ivy-covered gates to everyone—from professionals, to retirees, to Harvard’s very own employees. Extension School students can take advantage of many courses taught at the College by the same professors, who have found that the range of personal experiences and the more practical goals of these students create a different, but no less stimulating, classroom environment.While the majority of the 13,000 students enrolled at the Extension School takes courses purely out of intellectual interest, others are enrolled in associate, undergraduate, and master’s degree programs in order to advance in their fields or shift careers. In 2011, 588 students were enrolled in undergraduate degree programs and 1,210 were enrolled in graduate degree programs at the Extension School. To receive a Bachelor in Liberal Arts degree, comparable to a Bachelor of Arts from the College, a student must complete approximately 32 courses, with each class ranging in price from $995 to $1,950.“Extension school students are paying cash out of pocket to come to class, and so missing a class is actually a big deal for them,” says Daniel G. Donoghue, an English professor who has taught at the Extension School since 1987. “If I should cancel a class for Harvard College students, they’d consider that a holiday,” he says, with a knowing smile.Perhaps as a result of the visible price tag of each course, many Extension School students are quite dedicated to attending every class. “It’s not just a matter of rolling out of bed in the morning when it’s snowing and raining,” says Jennifer L. Hochschild, a government professor. “I’ve had students fly in from the West Coast, Virginia, Portland, Washington, New York,” she says.Many of these students have a pragmatic approach to education, perhaps born of the lengths they go to pursue their studies. Hochschild said that her students’ interests in the practical have challenged her to justify her curricula. “Sometimes they need more persuasion that what I’m asking them to read and think about is worth their while. They’ll say quite explicitly, ‘I don’t see why you’ve asked us to read this; what’s the point?’” Hochschild says. “That’s a little startling when someone says that in the classroom. Undergrads don’t usually say that so explicitly—they may think it, but they don’t say it.”

Professors notice another difference in the ways in which Extension School and College students approach their classwork. “[HES students’] life experiences prepare them for reality,” says David C. Bell, who teaches nanotechnology and microfluidics courses at the Extension School. “Harvard College students are very good, but they haven’t had a job; they’ve been in university all the time, and they don’t know how industry works necessarily.”These differing life experiences challenge professors to accommodate the diverse backgrounds of their students. Cheryl D. Vaughan, Assistant Director of Science Instruction at the Division of Continuing Education, compares her experience teaching Extension School students to teaching the parents of undergraduates. She points out that while many Extension School students have a wealth of experience in their respective fields, others may have gaps in their learning: It may have been decades since they’ve stepped into a science laboratory, for example.“The challenge of teaching the Extension school population is greater because you don’t know right away what the gaps are and what their experience is,” Vaughan says. “You have to come to the classroom respecting the experience they have.”While the differences in backgrounds and skills may pose a challenge for instructors, they can enhance the classroom experience for students. “We can end up in a situation where somebody doesn’t know how to do ‘x,’ but someone else in the lab does and can do it better than anyone,” Bell says.Extension School students frequently bring their life experiences into the classroom and relate them to the discussion at hand. “They are more inclined to use their own careers and life trajectories and they bring those things to bear on the readings more directly,” says Hochschild.She has had students who have years of experience in political campaigns or who have run for office. “They’ll read an article about a politician’s incentives or the processes of engaging in a political campaign and they’ll say ‘No, I ran for office, and that wasn’t the way I did it.’ Or, ‘In the campaign I was running, that isn’t how it works,’” Hochschild adds.Donoghue teaches a seminar on Seamus Heaney and “Beowulf” and recalls moments when the broader life experiences of his Extension School students illuminated parts of the epic. “There are a lot of poignant, elegiac moments in ‘Beowulf’ concerning grief, loss, and the passage of civilization and it was a very emotional thing to read these passages,” he says. “It brought us out of the immediate moment of the teaching of that class and made us realize some hard truths in the world.”By allowing anyone to register for classes and investigate their intellectual pursuits, the Extension School has established itself as a highly democratic institution. “In a way, it’s Harvard’s public face to many people in the Boston area: This is the portal through which they can go and obtain some of the benefits that Harvard has to give,” Donaghue says.Vaughan, too, points to how the Extension School has unique effects on its students. While she says she loves teaching College students, she knows that “they’re going to be fine” with or without her. “I have a whole packet of thank you notes from adults who are on their way to a better job or to a PhD program,” Vaughan says, pausing for a moment. “It feels like changing lives.”

If extraterrestrial life exists near dying stars, there may be a way to detect it within the next decade, according to a new theoretical study co-authored by Harvard astronomy professor Abraham “Avi” Loeb.The study, which was also authored by Tel Aviv University professor Dan Maoz, developed a method for identifying oxygen in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets orbiting the class of cooling stars known as “white dwarfs.”While many previous studies have proposed methods to investigate the possibility of life on the planets of stars in the middle of their lifetimes, like our sun, Loeb said that none of these proposals were “practical in the immediate future.”In contrast, Loeb’s proposal uses NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, which is slated to launch in 2018.Within just five hours, the telescope would be able to detect whether the atmospheres of planets surrounding white dwarfs contain oxygen using infrared analysis.
Harvard astronomy professor Jonathan “Josh” E. Grindlay said that although this study offers “a very reasonable approach,” it is “very unlikely” that this particular method will yield the discovery of extraterrestrial life.In their study, Loeb and Maoz estimated that the examination of 500 white dwarfs will yield at least one terrestrial planet with the potential for life.Because white dwarfs and the Earth are comparable in size, a planet of the Earth’s volume would block the white dwarf’s light once in every orbit. Due to this pattern, only a “relatively modest effort” would be required for astronomers to detect white dwarfs with planets, Loeb said.But due to the relative dimness of white dwarfs, it is unlikely that 500 will be quickly detected, Grindlay said.No white dwarf planets have been discovered yet. These planets must be detected before Loeb and Maoz’s method can be applied.Loeb said that he is “100 percent sure” that the telescope will be available for the project after white dwarf planets are identified.“The question of whether there is life outside the earth is perhaps the most exciting question that astronomers can answer,” Loeb said. “If we find a positive answer to this question, it would have major implications for not just science, but philosophy, religion, everything. It would change our conception of our place in the universe.”

More than half of student organizations on campus are skewed towards single-gender leadership, according to a recent report on gender in leadership at the College. The report defines skewed leadership boards as those which are at least two-thirds male or two-thirds female.Commissioned by the Undergraduate Council and the Harvard College Women’s Center, the report served as a follow-up to an internal study conducted in 2007 and revealed that gender ratios among leaders of Harvard student groups have changed little since the first study.The report, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/10/women-leadership-harvard-clubs/"">written primarily by former UC vice president Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, focuses on examining potential gender gaps in student group leadership, gender parity in organizations considered to be “prestigious,” and undergraduate perceptions of gender and leadership.This year’s study confirmed that there is largely the same number of female and male leaders running Harvard organizations, similar to the study conducted in 2007.According to data provided by the Office of Student Life that was used in the report, the number of male-skewed leadership boards outnumbered female-skewed ones nearly 6 to 1. The gender ratio in the executive boards of health and wellness groups is 7 to 1, female to male. In addition, 24.8 percent of all groups on campus were exclusively led by members of one gender.
While Yalamanchi applauded the apparent gender parity, she voiced concern about gender-skewed leadership in different types of organizations.“I think what’s sort of the main takeaway from the report is that men and women lead in different spaces, and I don’t know if that’s necessarily best for either of those spaces,” Yalamanchi said.The study also looked at gender parity in the leadership of “prestigious” organizations. In a survey conducted at each of the dining halls in mid-October 2012, over 500 students were asked to list what they each perceived to be the top five most “prestigious” organizations on campus, allowing individual interpretation of the meaning.The top five groups, in ascending order, were The Crimson, the UC, the Institute of Politics, the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, and the Hasty Pudding Theatricals.According to the survey responses, 48 percent of the 29 listed groups are male-skewed in their leadership, many of which are exclusively male organizations.The report featured information from three undergraduate focus groups on gender and leadership, which showed a marked difference between perceptions of gender by freshmen and upperclassmen.First-year students in the focus groups felt more strongly than upperclassmen that “societal gender norms play into organization structures.”“What was very true about the freshmen was that their backgrounds and socioeconomic experiences really defined how they viewed gender at Harvard,” Yalamanchi said.The 39-page report was submitted to University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who referred it to the FAS Standing Committee on Women for review.While the UC and the Women’s Center await further recommendations from the Standing Committee, Women’s Center Director Gina Helfrich hopes that the findings will encourage discussions within the student body but most importantly throughout the more than 400 leadership boards of campus clubs.“I think this [report] presents a good opportunity for our campus to discuss whether we are comfortable with the current role of gender in leadership,” Helfrich said.—Staff writer Steven S.

In a finding that that could improve the effectiveness of treatments, Harvard Medical School researchers have found that certain genes are associated with five psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism.“We have found evidence of genetic links between these disorders, which points us in a new direction in understanding the biology behind mental disorders,” said Medical School professor Jordan W. Smoller ’83, the study’s lead author.Most treatments used today are based on limited knowledge of the biology behind psychiatric disorders, Smoller said.“Currently it’s classified by symptoms and not causes,” Smoller said. “This study may allow us to approach mental illness in a different way and ultimately classify and diagnose based on underlying cause rather than simply symptom profile.”Smoller added that this may allow doctors to be more effective in diagnosis and treatment.
The study was conducted by Harvard Medical School professor of psychiatry Jordan W. Smoller ’83 and researchers from the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.According to Smoller, the study is the largest of its kind across multiple psychiatric disorders. The research involved scientists from 19 countries collaborating and sharing data.“It’s an incredibly important study because it validates what we have had an intuition about for a long time,” said Joshua W. Buckholtz, assistant professor of psychology at Harvard. Buckholtz said the study confirmed the idea that there is no one-to-one mapping between genes and genetic variants and discrete psychiatric disorders as defined by the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Alisha R. Pollastri, a research fellow in the Smoller Laboratory, cautioned that while the results are important, they only explain a small amount of an individual’s susceptibility to the disorders.“It is one small step to understanding a bigger picture,” Pollastri wrote in an email.She added that the study’s finding paves the way for additional exploration of the role of calcium channels in the five psychiatric disorders identified to share the same genetic basis.According to Pollastri, exploration of calcium channels may contribute to a better understanding of treatment options.“No single study is going to provide a cure or answer overnight,” Buckholtz said. “What this study does is focus research efforts on aspects of treatment that are broadly applicable to multiple disorders that affect people.”—Staff writer C.C.

Heading into the final weekend of Ancient Eight play, there are exactly five basketball games that matter in the quest for the league title.And while the Harvard men’s basketball team’s Ivy championship outlook is decidedly bleaker than was the case one short week ago—and an outright title is all but off the table—the Crimson (17-9, 9-3 Ivy) retains a shot at the crown.Thanks to two Harvard losses last weekend to Princeton and Penn, the Tigers (16-9, 9-2) have jumped into the driver’s seat heading into the final stretch of league play. For the first time this season, Princeton holds a half-game advantage over the Crimson in the standings with three days worth of conference contests remaining.According to Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, the Crimson’s only focus is on the part of the equation within its control—two games at Lavietes Pavilion this weekend, as Harvard plays host to Columbia (12-14, 4-8) and Cornell (13-16, 5-7) on Friday and Saturday, respectively.“Certainly, if we want to have an opportunity for things to fall our way, we have to do our job,” Amaker said. “And our job is to see if we can really play well this weekend and win.”
Needless to say, both of the Harvard’s final two games are virtual must-wins if the Crimson hopes to punch a ticket to March Madness, and even then, Princeton could still claim the title.“A lot is at stake for us in a lot of different ways, but we’re not playing out all of the scenarios and all that,” Amaker said. “We’re at home, our final conference games, senior weekend, seeing if we can finish strong.”First on the slate is Columbia—the only team in the Ivy League that the Harvard has yet to beat this season. When the teams last met, the Lions upset a heavily favored Crimson squad, 78-63—the biggest margin of victory, win or loss, in all of Harvard’s conference games.“[Columbia] is a pretty potent offensive team at times, and we saw that first hand,” Amaker said. “Our game against them [on Feb. 10] could have been one of their best games, if not their best game, of the year. They had great balance.”For Harvard to come out on top Friday night, it will need an increased defensive presence, particularly given the recent 75-point performance of a Quakers squad that has averaged 62.8 points per game this season.“We had a steady diet of defense this week in practice because we weren’t very successful at Penn on the defensive end,” said freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. “We are trying to focus on what we did wrong and trying to fix that [for this weekend].”Last time out, the Crimson struggled to contain the Lions’ offense, allowing guard Steve Frankoski to score 27 points on the game, including 20 in the first half alone.“He just annihilated us,” said Amaker of Frankoski’s career performance. “What we’ve been trying to do in our practices this week is that we have to do a better job of guarding their perimeter players.”Frankoski and Columbia point guard Brian Barbour—who leads his team with 12 points and 4.2 assists per game—will likely headline the Crimson’s defensive challenges on the perimeter, while Mark Cisco and John Daniels each average greater than four rebounds per game on the inside. In the two teams’ contest at Columbia, the Lions outrebounded the Crimson, 33-22, and scored 12 more points in the paint.“We gave up way too many second shots in New York, and we also gave up too many open shots,” Chambers said. “Those are two areas on the defensive end that we really need to focus on.”Although the Crimson was able to squeak by with a 67-65 win in its first matchup against the Big Red, the victory did not come without major difficulty. Chambers led the Crimson on the day, notching an impressive 18 points and 11 assists against a Cornell team that has been plagued by injury as of late.“We’re not sure who’s going to play [for Cornell],” said Amaker of the Big Red’s depleted roster. “Obviously their quickness, their athleticism, similar to a Penn, gave us a lot of problems [last time]. I anticipate that however many healthy bodies they have or whatever the situation is, that they would play us very tough, very aggressively.”In addition to any conference implications, this weekend also marks co-captain Christian Webster’s final home games in a Harvard uniform. Webster—the lone senior on the Crimson’s roster—recently earned the distinction of being the winningest player in the history of Harvard basketball.“[Webster] has enhanced our program immeasurably, certainly by his presence and also by his game,” Amaker said. “We’re going to miss him. We’re hopeful that we can finish this the right way for him.”—Staff writer Catherine E. Coppinger can be reached at ccoppinger@college.harvard.edu.

FM sat down with Professor James H. Waldo, Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Computer Science, Chief Technology Officer, and Professor of Computer Science 105: Privacy and Technology, to discuss the privacy issues surrounding Google Glass, a soon-to-be-released device. Worn like a pair of glasses, follows voice commands to take photos, record videos, search for information, and share all of it across the Internet.FM: How do you think Google Glass will affect and change privacy laws in the future?JHW: It’s hard to say, because it’s not clear what the capabilities of the Google Glasses are going to be. In some sense they’re not going to be different from what we’ve already got—you already carry a camera and a recorder with you all the time. But what is going to be different is that if these things become ubiquitous or even fairly common, it’s going to be hard to tell when you’re being photographed or when you’re being recorded. We already have laws that protect you from being recorded, but the law almost always lags behind technology, by a considerable amount…. It could be the sort of thing where in certain situations, everyone is asked to take their glasses off. Maybe it means we’re just more careful about what we say in all situations, knowing that by default, unless you’re in a room with someone you know and trust, anything you say is essentially public.

2012-13 marked yet another disappointing regular season for the Harvard men’s hockey program, which finished dead last in the ECAC for the first time in team history.But thanks to a provision that grants a conference tournament birth to every squad in the league, that fact does not really matter much at all.The Crimson (9-17-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) is in the postseason, where it has the chance to return to its first NCAA Tournament since 2006 if it can get hot at the right time.That journey begins this weekend, when Harvard travels to Thompson Arena to take on fifth-seeded Dartmouth (13-11-5, 9-9-4) in the first round of the ECAC playoffs.“We’re obviously really excited,” senior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “I think it should be a good matchup.”
The Crimson’s Ivy League rival, ranked No. 18 in the final regular season USCHO poll, enters the contest with just three wins in its previous 12 games. But it went undefeated in the season series against Harvard, registering a 3-2 victory in Hanover on Jan. 12 and tying the Crimson, 1-1, at the Bright Hockey Center on Feb. 10.Fallstrom, though, said that Harvard—which knocked off No. 1 Quinnipiac last Friday night—is not currently the same team the Big Green had previously faced.“When we lost against them at their place I felt like it was at that point in the season where we really weren’t playing our best,” Fallstrom said. “Then we played them at home, and I felt like we were still at a point where we were [just] gaining our momentum. They haven’t seen us the way we are now. They haven’t seen us full throttle, so to say.”The Big Green ranked in the middle of the conference in most offensive categories this season, though defensively its penalty-kill rate of 89.2 percent was second-best in the ECAC and fourth-best in the country. That could spell trouble for Harvard, whose 11.7 percent conversion rate on power plays was second-worst nationally.Dartmouth also does not make many mistakes, as it registered the ninth-fewest penalty minutes per game in the country this year.Forwards Tyler Sikura and Eric Robinson tied for the team lead with 10 goals, while Sikura’s 28 points paced the squad.“Dartmouth is a team that looks a lot like us player-wise,” junior goaltender Raphael Girard said. “It’s more of a skilled team that looks to make plays around the net, rather than going to hit a lot of people and put a lot of traffic on net. It’s [a] good [matchup] for us.”Junior Cab Morris (8-6-3) and freshman Charles Grant (5-5-2) have split time in goal, with the pair posing nearly equivalent save percentages. Morris made 22 and 21 saves in the teams’ first two meetings, respectively, but Grant has seen most of the action of late.At the other end will be Girard, who struggled for most of the season, allowing 2.98 goals per game. But the team hopes he can replicate his breakout playoff performance from a year ago, when a dominant run sparked the team to the ECAC Championship Game.“[Last season’s playoffs] gave me good confidence,” Girard said. “I know I can be a big difference maker in this series—as much as I was last year, or even better.”

Friday Night:I start off Friday night right: with a two hour phone call to my mom. I am fishing for sympathy, perhaps a care package or two, but when I tell her I am too stressed to binge drink this weekend I get nothing. “Good” she says, “go study.”Taking her advice, I start on my government readings.One hour later I am at a Highlighter party. I have no idea how I ended up there and no idea where to stash my backpack—I would hate for someone to steal my government readings, or my laptop.One kid compliments my dress. The second tries to put highlighter “black light” goo on it. I slap him away: It’s dry-clean only.
The kid who complimented my dress comes up to me and tries to say something witty, “Wow we are running into each other a lot tonight.”I am unimpressed and preoccupied by the fear that there is goo on my dress.He starts to introduce himself, “My name is-”I walk away. I am too sober for this.I go back home and finish reading The Federalist Papers. That Madison has a way with words.Saturday Night:Hearing rumors of another highlighter party I promise my mother that I am going to lock myself in my room and study.I’m pretty faithful to my word until about 11 p.m., when a 10 minute study break transforms into me lying about my nationality at an international party. The good news is that I remembered to leave my backpack at home; the bad news is that my Canadian accent sounds like a pirate’s and no one believes that I am from British Colombia.One kid, potentially an actual Canadian, asks me to dance. I ask him if he is a freshman. He says, “yes,” so I say “no.”I am too sober for this.I go for a drink, but instead the bartender lets me pocket a Smirnoff nip for later. Success! I take my drink and head to my highlighter party. I spend the wee hours of Sunday morning reviewing my seismic imaging notes for my environmental science class.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority plans to replace a portion of the Red Line train service with buses from Kendall to Park Station for 25 weekends, starting this summer and continuing to the fall of 2016.The Red Line will not be able to continue as scheduled because Longfellow Bridge, which connects Cambridge and Boston, will be undergoing construction.The Longfellow Bridge Rehabilitation Project, coordinated by Massachusetts Department of Transportation, will upgrade the bridge’s structural capacity and bring it up to modern safety codes. While improving the conditions of the bridge, the construction could hinder students from traveling to Boston.“It’ll be pretty inconvenient for college students particularly those at Harvard, MIT, and Tufts who don’t have an alternative way of getting around,” Christopher J. Magnani ’15 said.Will F. Poff-Webster ’14 echoed Magnani’s concerns, emphasizing that students do not take advantage of the Harvard’s proximity to Boston.
“Harvard students don’t go into Boston often enough,” Poff-Webster said. “The Red Line is an important resource to help students explore Boston. Taking it away would make that far less prevalent.”The Longfellow Bridge Rehabilitation Project is a part of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s Accelerated Bridge Program, in which the state allocated $400 million to improving the conditions of structurally deficient bridges in the Lower Basin area of the Charles River.The Massachusetts Department of Transportation Board of Directors approved the construction contract for the Longfellow Bridge on Feb. 27. This decision marks the Final Rehabilitation phase of the Longfellow Bridge Rehabilitation Project, following the first Early Action stage, which was completed in January 2012.In addition to structural improvement, the bridge will be modified to allow the sidewalk approaches to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibilty Guidelines.According to MBTA Director of Communications Joe Pesaturo, only five of the affected weekends will fall in 2013. Once they are finalized, the dates of the weekends in which part of the Red Line will be replaced with buses will be available on the MBTA website.

The issue of <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/7/sexual-assault-at-harvard/"">sexual assault at Harvard has received increased attention in recent months. Recently leaked statistics from Princeton show that this rising concern about sexual assault extends to other Ivy League universities, too.In a 2008 survey, the results of which were released by The Daily Princetonian this week, one in six female undergraduates at Princeton reported that they had experienced non-consensual vaginal penetration during their time at the University. According to the <a href=""http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2013/03/04/32954/"">article in The Daily Princetonian, it remains unclear just why the survey was never published. But one administrator claimed that because the data was consistent with the <a href=""http://www.nyu.edu/shc/promotion/svstat.html"">national average of one in five women being raped during their college years, the administration likely did not want to draw unwanted attention to the issue.<!--more-->Amanda Sandoval, Director of Princeton's Women's Center, <a href=""http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2013/03/04/32954/"">told The Daily Princetonian that the survey results were ""not anything unexpected,"" and that releasing the numbers would have caused unneccessary media attention, especially given that none of Princeton's peer institutions have published similar data. Indeed, other Ivy League administrators seem to have either neglected to conduct surveys about sexual assault or have allowed them to go unpublished.As Harvard and its peer institutions look to combat sexual assault on campus, disturbing numbers like these ensure that a bright spotlight will continue to be shone on these issues.

I don’t remember how the scars started. I’ve never been able to  actually see or touch them, but I’ve carried them for as long as I can  remember. Sometimes I forget they’re even there, but I can never quite  escape them.Maybe it has something to do with the city, and how, late at night,  the ohsoquiet doesn’t let me forget about the ceaseless, clear coquí frog sounds that would sing me to sleep. Maybe it’s related to the  borderline panic attacks I get when it’s been days since I’ve said  something, let alone had a thought, in Spanish.Maybe it has more to do with our different perceptions of beaches.  For most of my friends here at school, they’re the quintessential  indicators of paradise. Apparently, if you live close to one, all you  ever do is work on your tan and sip on piña coladas. Don’t forget about  grinding to reggaetón. (Daddy Yankee, yo!)To these friends, beaches aren’t hidden sanctuaries for broken  bottles and shards of glass, cigarette butts, or used syringes. They  aren’t places that shock them into remembering how small they are, but  rather places that allow them to disconnect from their “real world” in  the States.That real world isn’t as far away as they might wish it to be. It’s here as well, just a few miles away from my San Juan home.
The  summer before we all left for college, a group of friends and I went on  a road trip, determined to find one of the island’s hidden gems: an ice  cream shop that serves flavors like sweet plantain, cod fish, and rice  pudding.I was dubbed the designated driver, even though I had no idea how  to get there. After we all crammed into my lime-green Volkswagen Beetle,  we were off, serenaded by the likes of bands from ‘N Sync to Major  Lazer. No regrets.The road signs gave distances in kilometers. We, however, were  brought up under U.S. customary units. As a result—and with Google Maps  on the fritz because even it finds nations in political limbo  trifling—it took us a while to understand the labyrinthine mountain  roads.Several hours later, we made it to Lares’ town square. After taking  a solid 15 minutes to parallel park my car into a space that could have  easily fit two vdub bugs, we ran to the store, where we proceeded to  sample one of almost everything. One of my friends treated herself to a  dulce de leche/coffee combo, I indulged in a cinnamon-flavored  coquito/corn concoction. We both rolled our eyes at the endearing  environmentalist smoker in our group, who wondered if the shop promoted  humane food production policies.Right before leaving, we walked around the plaza and, like your  typical prematurely nostalgic teenagers, took pictures throughout the 20  minutes we spent in town. Slightly embarrassed, I couldn’t help but  look at the locals between shots.I could feel their friendly, yet distrusting gazes reflected on my  thin, black-rimmed glasses. Chuckling at our own witticisms while  photographing what we thought were community oddities, we were  inadvertently making a spectacle out of their day-to-day lives. I gulped  dryly at that realization—I was no better than the Coppertone-smeared  tourists who show up in Old San Juan dressed like they’re about to go on  safari.Now that I go to Harvard, a high school parent’s wet dream,  presumably, I don’t feel as guilty keeping tabs on the Isle from afar.And  yet, when I pull up my local newspaper’s homepage, I read the  headlines—Gang Violence Rises, Innocent Bystander Caught in Gunfire (a  six-year-old, this time), and JLo Shares Table with Marc Anthony’s  Girlfriend—and the scars start to sting again.Puerto Rico, my heart’s de-vo-tion. Let it sink back in the ocean.What am I doing here? Where do I fit in all of this?  Shouldn’t I be home, trying to accomplish something more concrete than  turning in some bullshit research paper? Why did I leave?As  vapid as I’m aware it might sound, I was worried that I would be missing  out on an opportunity, whatever that’s supposed to mean, by staying in  San Juan. Worried that I wouldn’t grow if I did not physically remove  myself from a relatively insular culture. All that worry, it seems,  became a spineless feeling, a sense of cowardice. One that, over time,  dug into my skin, hardened into these scars, and almost immediately  became invisible to those who haven’t looked closely enough.But these scars aren’t something to be ashamed of. They’re here for me to keep, and hey, scars make me look like a badass.Valeria M. Pelet, 2015, is a History and Literature concentrator in Winthrop House. Her “real world” is way better than MTV’s.

What has three letters, one syllable, and a history of being excluded from every inaugural address before this January? “Gay.”President Obama <a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-21/politics/36473188_1_tradition-of-equal-rights-gay-equality-gay-rights"">broke a longstanding taboo by inserting the word into his speech to the nation after his second public swearing-in. “If we are truly all created equal,” the president continued, “then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.” Obama may have a penchant for talking big and acting small, but his administration <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/us/politics/administration-to-urge-justices-to-overturn-a-gay-marriage-ban.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hp"">filed a brief last Thursday that added a little bite to the presidential bark: The White House will fight for marriage equality and against California’s <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/californias_proposition_8_samesex_marriage/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"">Proposition 8, the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, in the Supreme Court this month.The Obama administration argues that laws that treat gay citizens differently from straight citizens violate the Constitution’s equal protection clause. As a result, according to the White House, those laws should be subject to a heightened form of review known as <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny"">strict scrutiny. And in order to pass strict scrutiny, a law must serve a compelling government interest. But what compelling reason, asks the White House, could California possibly have for denying homosexual couples the right to marry when those couples receive the same privileges and benefits as do heterosexual couples through civil unions?The White House points to <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/02/u-s-endorses-limited-gay-marriage-right/"">seven states whose civil union provisions mirror those of California: Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island, and its argument applies only to those states. Critics <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/opinion/the-white-house-joins-the-fight-on-gay-marriage.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;"">complain that the White House has not gone far enough, that the Obama administration should ask the Court to acknowledge a constitutional right to gay marriage. But today’s generally conservative Court surely will not take so dramatic a step. The administration recognizes this truth and has offered the Court—or, more specifically, swing-vote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy—another possible option for a ruling.That ruling would still mark a major advance for gay rights. Strict scrutiny is a stringent test, difficult for any law to pass. If the Court sided with the federal government, all laws that discriminated based on sexual orientation would undergo such heightened review, making it close to impossible for them to stand. What’s more, one small step today would pave the way for a bigger leap tomorrow.
Tomorrow could not come soon enough. When our Founding Fathers wrote the <a href=""http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html"">Constitution in the voice of “We the People,” that people may have included only rich, white, straight males. And when slaveholder Thomas Jefferson penned the <a href=""http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html"">Declaration of Independence, the “truth” that “all men are created equal” may not always have been entirely “self-evident.” But as time has passed, so has some of our prejudice. The crusade for gay rights is another stage of our nation’s journey toward fair treatment under the law. Before the civil rights movement and the women’s rights movement, equality in the United States existed only in theory. For decades, we have been fighting to turn it into reality.We’re not there yet. But every moment, support for equal rights for same-sex couples <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/us/justices-consider-same-sex-marriage-cases-for-docket.html"">increases. In October, a Pew poll revealed that 49 percent of Americans think gay marriage should be legal. In 2008, only 39 percent were in favor. And a Gallup poll from November showed that 73 percent of the people between 18 and 29 years old want gays and lesbians to be allowed to marry legally.Young people aren’t the only ones exhibiting a shifting attitude toward gay marriage. Over 200 companies, including big-league players like Citigroup and Apple, have <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/business/companies-ask-justices-to-overturn-gay-marriage-ban.html?_r=0"">signed onto a brief in another Supreme Court case arguing against the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act. Even a group of prominent Republicans have <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/us/politics/prominent-republicans-sign-brief-in-support-of-gay-marriage.html"">spoken out against Proposition 8.One day, “liberty and justice for all” will be more than just a mindless refrain schoolchildren chant as they raise the star-spangled banner every morning, before turning a blind eye when they see their peers mercilessly ostracized and bullied, lampooned on Facebook, and stuffed into lockers in the halls as punishment for the crime of being different. The rising generation, corporate organizations, and members of the conservative GOP have recognized the need for this day to come as soon as possible. The Supreme Court should recognize it, too.Molly L. Roberts ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Holworthy Hall. Her column appears on alternate Thursdays.

“I want to know what happened in that room when they were making a decision that changed my entire life.” Julie, an undergraduate, says she will never understand why the Administrative Board decided in its closed deliberations in the Forum Room on the third floor of Lamont Library to allow the student who sexually assaulted her to remain on campus.  Julie, who has been granted anonymity by The Crimson because she fears retaliation from her perpetrator, initially felt optimistic about the College’s response to her sexual assault. After reporting the rape, Julie felt encouraged by the responses of Harvard University Police Department and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. Assured that there was significant evidence to build a case against the perpetrator, Julie took her case to the Ad Board.
 In light of this, she said, the Ad Board’s ultimate decision not to require the perpetrator to withdraw was particularly disheartening.  Paola, another College student who was sexually assaulted on campus, also found OSAPR to be a helpful resource. Yet she expresses deep disappointment with the way that administrators respond to students coming forward with experiences of sexual assault. “They question the event so much and ask if you were in the wrong so many times that, after a while, one begins questioning if it even happened,” she writes in an email to The Crimson. Paola, who has been granted anonymity by The Crimson to protect her privacy, decided not to pursue her case with the Ad Board in part because she knew the perpetrator.  For a growing number of students on campus, stories like Julie’s and Paola’s highlight what they describe as a disparity between Harvard’s many resources for the victims of sexual assault and the policies that govern the ways in which incidents of sexual assault are investigated and adjudicated. These critics, who include sexual assault survivors and campus activists, say that the Ad Board’s written policy language is not favorable to victims of sexual assault, and that the Ad Board’s lack of transparency about its processes intimidates students who bring their cases before the Board. Harvard is currently conducting an ongoing review of its sexual assault policies across its various schools and has recently hired its first ever University-wide Title IX coordinator, who begins work this month. Still, some students feel that these efforts are not enough. They say that changes in the way administrators handle cases of sexual assault at the College level are progressing too slowly, and are not sufficiently responsive to student concerns.

After an undefeated dual meet season, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team looks to secure its place at the top of Ancient Eight swimming with a win at this weekend’s Ivy League Championships.“The team goal is always to win the Ivies,” sophomore Chuck Katis said. “This is the strongest team we’ve ever had.”Given the Crimson’s performance this season, the team has earned the right to be confident. The 18th ranked Harvard squad is 9-0 (7-0 Ivy) in dual meets this season and has been dominant in the Ivy League. The Crimson is seeking to take home its 23rd Ivy Championship.“I’m not going in worried about anybody, I’m excited about my team,” Murphy said.Harvard’s main competition will come from Princeton who pushed them close in a meet earlier in the season on Feb. 2. The Crimson and the Tigers have taken home the last forty Ivy League championships, splitting them twenty apiece.
Princeton has been more successful of late, winning the last four and six of the last seven titles. However, the superlative Tiger Class of 2012 has graduated and in their wake Harvard has been the team to beat in the Ivy League thus far. Princeton has dropped dual meets against both the Crimson and Columbia this season.“Of course Princeton is our main rival,” Katis said. “We have a lot of big races against them.”When they met earlier in the season, Harvard became the first Ivy school to defeat the Tigers in its home pool, prevailing by a score of 200-153.Despite the loss earlier in the season, the four-time reigning Ivy League champions will certainly be a threat in the water.“We’re not really worried about anybody,” Murphy said. “We just take care of ourselves.”A large part of the Crimson’s success this year has been the impressive performances from Katis. At the UGA fall invite on Nov. 30 this season, Katis set Harvard records in the 100m and 200m breaststroke with times of 52.49 and 1:52.08 respectively. Both times set NCAA ‘A’ standards and qualified him for the 2013 NCAA National Championship.Katis impressed as a freshman, receiving second team All-Ivy honors in several events and added a pair of All-American honorable mentions as a member of the Crimson’s 400 free relay and 800 free relay teams.He went on to put in three top-50 performances at the 2012 Olympic team trials over the summer. His performance this season has since been formidable, particularly with regard to the two aforementioned Harvard records.“He has a tremendous work ethic and he just keeps plugging away,” Murphy said. “He’s very consistent, he’s very motivated, and he’s very disciplined so it’s a nice combination.”While Katis was keen to emphasize the team aspect of the upcoming meet, on an individual note the Ivy League championships may bring back bittersweet memories. He finished second in both the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke races and will be going out this year trying to go one better.

You’ve heard it before: Student enrolls at Harvard, student develops business idea, student drops out.But the story runs differently for Sujay Tyle and Connor Zwick, formerly of the classes of 2013 and 2015, respectively. Unlike their predecessors, they were given $100,000 and some of the best connections in the business world when they left Harvard. Each applied for a Thiel Fellowship and was among the fewer than five percent of applicants accepted.In 2011 and 2012, Tyle and Zwick packed their bags and joined the ranks of the 20 individuals under the age of 20 selected annually by billionaire Peter A. Thiel, founder and CEO of PayPal and first external investor of Facebook. They launched their careers as entrepreneurs—with Thiel’s help, of course.Along with co-founder James O’Neill, Thiel developed the fellowship to encourage young entrepreneurs to consider routes that are alternative to traditional forms of higher education. “What we want to suggest,” Thiel explained in a 2011 interview with the National Review, “is that there are some very smart and very talented people who don’t need college.”But Tyle and Zwick’s diverse experiences suggest that a college education may not be dispensible, even for a Thiel fellow.
Sujay Tyle:Tyle describes his experience with the Thiel Fellowship as “kind of cool and crazy and wild.” Although few of his classmates were aware of his true age, Tyle started as a freshman at Harvard when he was 15 years old. By the time he dropped out as a junior, he had found a blocking group of close friends, gained membership into the Owl Club—and engaged in six years of groundbreaking biofuel research.When he first left Harvard for the fellowship, Tyle was eager to gain real-world experience at Scopely, a Silicon Valley mobile gaming startup. He discovered that, for the first time in his life, he wasn’t always the youngest person in the room, and that his status as a dropout was immaterial to his co-workers.Yet as Tyle searched for engineers for Scopely, he realized the recruiting process needed to change. After finding like-minded entrepreneurs at a conference in Ireland, Tyle left Scopely to start a business designed to fix the problems he encountered, looking to “revolutionize the world of… technical recruiting.”The fellowship provides him with an incredible support system that allows Tyle to be in constant communication with Thiel. “We’re on a texting relationship,” Tyle explains.His connections as a fellow don’t stop there: “On Monday, we all went to Peter’s house and met a bunch of Facebook executives and, you know, the co-founders of the biggest companies in the world,” Tyle says, describing a typical retreat Thiel holds monthly for his fellows; he goes on to detail a past trip to Hawaii and a future trip planned for Tahoe.Although Tyle was named one of Forbes’ “30 Under 30” innovators for games and apps this past December, he hasn’t forgotten his Crimson roots. He is quick to credit the school for much of his success, stressing the importance of his Harvard education.“I would never have been able to do anything that I’m doing right now without having gone to Harvard for two and a half years,” Tyle says. For him, the Thiel Fellowship meant exploring opportunities outside of Cambridge, and “not allowing education to stifle entrepreneurship.”Connor Zwick:When Zwick  left Harvard last year with Colton Gyulay, who was also in the class of 2015, to design a handheld mobile gaming device called the Coco Controller, he had been contemplating studying Romance Languages.

The resounding punch of the time card machine punctuates the silence as each spectator clocks in to the exhibit. Directly ahead, a model of a chicken sits between a suffragette’s calendar and an authentic gramophone. Bronzed sundials adorn the room’s back display cases.These objects are part of an ambitious interdisciplinary exploration of one of history’s most ubiquitous themes: time.The installment, “Time and Time Again,” is a collaboration between the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, the History of Science Department, and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. The exhibit features a broad array of time-related objects ranging from primitive Bedouin calendars to Japanese timekeeping devices.The exhibit is one of the first efforts by the Museums of Science and Culture to establish Harvard’s museums as part of an integrated network.“By bringing together Harvard’s museums in this one consortium, we could make it so much greater than the sum of its parts,” said Jane Pickering, executive director of Museums of Science and Culture.
Nearly a year ago, Sara J. Schechner ’79, curator of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, began brainstorming ways to utilize Harvard’s extensive collection of sundials and pocket-size clocks.With the help of a team including CHSI committee leader Peter L. Galison ’77 and CHSI director of administration Jean-Francois Gauvin, Schechner amassed a collection from the Museums of Science and Culture and beyond.“This is a place where we can do experimental, interdisciplinary exhibits,” said Galison, who is also a professor of physics and of history of science. “It’s is a way for people to think of tangible objects as openings for bigger intellectual questions.”The exhibit will feature a series of events and host several science and music classes over the course of its nine-month run in the Science Center’s second-floor gallery. Programming will begin on Saturday with a family festival on stories through time.“There’s a sort of playfulness to get people to think about the topic of time in ways they might not otherwise,” Schechner said.The installment also features its own smartphone app, “Time Trails,” intended to help unify the six outposts of the Museums of Science and Culture.As part of the initiative, a series of labels are scattered throughout the other museums in the consortium.Museumgoers can then scan the labels with their smartphones to trace the theme of time among Harvard’s various exhibits.“This is all part of our attempts to explore things in very open-ended ways,” said Galison.—Staff writer Jessica A.

For almost two weeks now, transformative energy has swept our campus on the topic of mental health at Harvard. On February 22, Undergraduate Council representatives attended a rally to stand in solidarity with our peers in response to the poignant<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/21/anonymous-schizophrenia-help/""> anonymous op-ed published the previous day. As representatives, we felt that it was our responsibility to understand student sentiment on this issue.We recognize that student groups, including Student Mental Health Liaisons and peer counseling groups, have been working in collaboration with University Health Services to improve mental health in our community for years. The gravity of their work cannot be overstated, and our peers, trained multiple times each year to navigate mental health concerns, cannot be ignored as invaluable <a href=""http://uc.fas.harvard.edu/index.php/2013/02/24/mental-health-resources/"">resources.The UC has also worked to improve student mental health by empowering students to directly interact with UHS. These interactions have occurred primarily through the UHS student-faculty committee and the Peer Patient Advocacy student-faculty committee. Appointed representatives to the UHS student-faculty committee pushed for the creation of a peer health advocate program in each dorm.Peer Patient Advocate positions were created this past year to solicit student feedback on experiences with UHS and direct those patients to the Patient Advocate, Linda Cannon, who is charged with investigating negative experiences and planning solutions. Though the structures exist to facilitate communication between student and Harvard’s health care providers, Peer Patient Advocates have found students generally unaware of the Advocate program, wary of reaching out, and hesitant to give specific information to work toward solutions.The Student Health Planning Committee worked to improve communication to students. Thanks to their work, this fall students received emails indicating their personal physician team, contact information, and name and information of UHS' Patient Advocate; all Houses and freshman dorms were sent a list of the physical and mental health resources available. The committee also focused on making UHS voluntarily compliant with the Affordable Care Act, such as by expanding the number of therapy visits to 24 and covering the cost of medications.
As a result of a specific recommendation of the Mental Health Task Force citing a need for greater communication for mental health resources to students, the wellness tutor program began in 2004. However, despite the progress made, lack of required training and disparities in tutors’ interests lead to inequalities in quality of mental health care support and resources on campus.Students have been able to impact Harvard policy to improve student health in the past, and we hope that the current campus energy around mental health can stimulate further discussion and improvements.Harvard's services are strong relative to peer institutions, and there is no doubt that we have dedicated professionals, administrators, and peers working to improve campus mental health. However, as a community, we must avoid complacency on this issue. We should strive for the improved mental health of each Harvard student; mental health should not fall prey to the institutional comparisons that Harvard favors. This is not about Princeton or Yale—this is about Harvard and what we can do better to benefit our students.Over 150 students attended the rally on February 22. The rally had no organizer, and word spread in under 24 hours. Regardless of the strength of our services, getting 150 Harvard students anywhere on a Friday afternoon without months of planning is a statement we cannot ignore.The UC heard our peers at the rally, and we have not ignored the call to action. We are hosting a town hall discussion this evening from 7-9 p.m. in Emerson Hall 105. The panel will feature Katherine Lapierre, Chief of UHS Student Mental Health Services; Sally Donahue, Director of Financial Aid; Brett Flehinger, Associate Secretary of the Administrative Board and former Resident Dean; Nancy Turnbull, Senior Lecturer on Health Policy and Associate Dean for Educational Programs at Harvard School of Public Health; Angela Lee ’14, Co-President of Student Mental Health Liaisons; and Rishab Mehan ’14, former Co-Director of Room 13 and a Peer Advising Fellow. We have been soliciting<a href=""http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=201b45""> questions and have also made time for open discussion. We ask you to come and voice your opinions so we can improve the resources available at Harvard and make communication between the administration and students more clear.Mental health is an issue that is relevant to every Harvard student, and it demands an urgent call for attention. It is important to raise awareness and encourage discussion among the greater Harvard community. We must capitalize on this moment on campus.We look forward to our future action. We have started fruitful collaborations with other student groups, and we plan to extend this conversation—beginning with tonight’s town hall—to other pockets of the Harvard community, including Houses and classrooms. As we learned two weeks ago, this issue is multifaceted, and the discussion should reflect that. We must answer questions about financial aid and the Ad Board, listen to the feedback surrounding mental health services, and work as a community to dispel misinformation and find solutions. Every interested voice should be included in these conversations. Together we can strive for a healthier Harvard.Megan B.

Wind power and wind farms may not be capable of producing as much energy as previously believed, according to a paper co-authored by Harvard scientist David W. Keith.Keith, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, co-published the paper on Feb. 25 in the online scientific journal Environmental Research Letters with Amanda S. Adams, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.Their study examined the long-range effects of one wind farm on another. The spacing between turbines is critical to each of their individual functioning, because a turbine placed directly behind another turbine cannot spin at full capacity and is therefore less efficient and able to put out less energy. This phenomenon is caused by the fact that in order to operate and move its blades, a wind turbine takes mechanical energy out of the wind passing through it. As a result, the speed of wind that has already passed through another turbine is lower when it hits the next in a series of the devices.Therefore, when a wind farm becomes large enough, according to the study, it can have a larger impact on the energy-producing capacity of surrounding wind farms. Due to these diminishing returns, Keith said future efforts to scale up the amount of wind power produced on earth will result in each new wind farm producing less power relative to its land area than previously expected.Keith said that past investigations into the impact of one turbine on another did not take into account large-scale decreases in wind speeds that arise from entire wind farms essentially removing energy from the wind.
“The old-style idea was that you just add it up,” Keith said. “You calculated the wind at the turbines around the world, and you added up all those things as if they work independently.”But even with diminishing power output, covering vast areas of land with turbines could potentially provide for power demands in the U.S., Keith said. However, Keith warned, the large number of turbines could come with other costs and consequences.Keith explained that although an individual wind turbine may be efficient, turbines in large numbers are both expensive to build and relatively inefficient when functioning collectively.If advances cannot make turbines more cost-efficient, Keith said, a significant increase in the amount of power produced by wind will not be financially sensible.Beyond monetary concerns, the paper also emphasizes that the implementation of wind power on a large scale can have a significant impact on the local environment. Keith said these effects will become significant and visible “well before” wind power supplies a third of U.S. primary energyWhile Keith said he believes wind power is a good alternative to coal or petroleum, expanding wind power to the scale of either energy resource would result in changing temperatures on Earth, which could impact a myriad of issues like crop growth. Land use also becomes a serious issue as wind farms become larger leading to the a need to build access roads to the turbines, Keith said.Keith said that although he would not totally discourage further research into wind power, he thinks people should put less effort into its development relative to other alternative energies, such as solar and nuclear power, which have more potential to offer a sustainable solution to energy demands.“We have to think analytically with numbers about what the consequences are of scaling up...and realize there are some [energy sources] we wouldn’t want to scale even if we could,” Keith said.Keith said he thinks policymakers should take into account existing research when allocating funds for energy development in the future.“This is a game of moral responsibility and political decision-making,” Keith said. “This is not some kind of passive guess about what happens. We’re part of the guess. We need to make political decisions about what we want to have happen, not guess.”

At the beginning of the season, the Harvard men’s hockey team was projected to finish near the top of the league, and the incoming crop of freshmen was touted to be the best in the ECAC.
While the team results may have fallen short of expectations, with the Crimson finishing at the bottom of the ECAC standings for the first time in history, the rookies did not disappoint.
The standout this season for the Harvard freshmen has been forward Jimmy Vesey, who was recently named Ivy League Rookie of the Year.<a name=""jump"">
Missing only a few games due to the World Junior Championships – in which he helped team USA earn the gold – Vesey played in 24 of 29 games for the Crimson, netting 11 goals and tallying 18 points, tied-for-first and second on the team, respectively.
In strictly Ivy League play he scored just one goal and had three assists, but in ECAC play he led freshmen in scoring with 15 points (nine goals and six assists), earning ECAC Rookie of the Week thrice and also ECAC Rookie of the Month for November.
The Ivy League also awarded captain Danny Biega, naming him to the All-Ivy League second team, his third All-Ivy honor of his career. The defenseman played a majority of minutes for Harvard, finishing the season with two goals and seven assists.
These two will look to continue their strong play into the ECAC playoffs, where the Crimson will face off against Ivy League rival Dartmouth, Friday night at Thompson Arena in Hanover, New Hampshire.

When Laura E. Donohue ’85 found out that the paper supplier Crane and Company was discontinuing the type of paper used by many students to print their theses, she knew she had to make a phone call.“I actually called Crane’s and got as [much] as I possibly could out of their warehouse,” said Donohue, owner of Bob Slate Stationer, a business on Brattle Street that sells thesis paper and binders. Bob Slate has already gone through 20 or 30 reams, as well 100 packs of the discontinued Crane paper. A ream contains 500 sheets of paper, and a pack, 100. Only a week into March, there’s just one ream left.As honors thesis deadlines come and go throughout March, businesses around Harvard Square are preparing for the inevitable spike in paper, binder, and printing requests that come as students complete the final stage of the taxing process.Gnomon Copy, a printing and copying business on Mass. Ave., has in the past few weeks alone had about 60 student requests for thesis printing or binding, owner Michael Skikne estimated, a figure he said is consistent with years past. Skikne said he expects that number to  increase in the next week as spring break and thesis deadlines approach.According to Donohue, Bob Slate has had about 100 students come in to buy acid-free paper or custom-made binders thus far.
Students have several options for where to print or bind their theses, from stores in the Square to the printing rooms in the Houses. Jeanne A. Follansbee, director of studies for the history and literature department, said her department does not make any official recommendations for where students choose to print their theses.On Feb. 28, history and literature concentrator Erin M. Fahy ’13 went with a friend to Gnomon Copy to print her thesis the night before it was due.Skikne said printing a thesis at Gnomon can cost anywhere from $10 to $100, depending on the type of paper used and whether or not it is printed in color. Fahy said hers cost about $23, and she said she was satisfied with the service.Fahy said she chose to have professionals print her thesis rather than opt for the House printing room “more for the peace of mind to have someone else [print] it.”Daniel M. Claridge ’13, an inactive Crimson video editor and an English concentrator, opted to print his creative writing thesis, a 90-page screenplay, in Lowell House on acid-free paper purchased from Bob Slate. Unlike many thesis writers, he did not have to purchase a binder because the English department provided one for him, he said.While many deadlines are still looming, those who have already pressed print said they are ready to enjoy post-thesis life.“It’s really nice to be done, and I’m glad hist. and lit. had an early due date,” Fahy said.—Staff writer Madeline R.

On Monday evening, students gathered in Hemenway Gymnasium, brightly colored yoga mats and chilled water bottles in tow. They quickly began to stretch, hoping to alleviate the day’s stress.With all but one upperclassman House offering free yoga sessions this semester, students have latched on to the opportunity to stretch and rejuvenate in a relaxing environment as a complement to their hectic lifestyles.“After the stresses of school, basketball practice, and homework, it’s really nice to be able to relax with some yoga,” said Katherine A. Metoyer ’16, a self-proclaimed yoga enthusiast. “It’s even nicer when you don’t have to go out of your way to find a time that fits your schedule because they’re offered so often.”These yoga classes, taught by House tutors as well as trained yoga professionals, are open to any Harvard students regardless of their House affiliation.“You’re welcome to join any of them—to go to another house if you can’t make Eliot’s sessions, or to go to every class and become, free of charge, an avid yogi,” Brandon R. Tilley, Eliot’s house wellness tutor, wrote in an email over the House list.
In the email, Tilley also encouraged everyone, including those who are more experienced and those who have never done yoga before, to participate.“Classes are especially apt for beginners and experts: [The instructor will] gently teach you the fundamentals, and can help even the most experienced among us to fine tune,” Tilley wrote in the email.Lucy V. Burke ’16 said she has been especially impressed with the yoga instructors on campus.“There was one time I got stuck in a very uncomfortable position, and they eased me out of it with great prowess,” she said.Kirin Gupta ’16 said that she believes this rising popularity of yoga at Harvard is a result of “contortionism being sexy.”“Think about the sheer sex appeal of putting your legs behind your head,” Gupta said.In addition to these classes at upperclassmen Houses, Harvard also offers yoga classes in Allston. The Center for Wellness has partnered with the Harvard Allston Education Portal to co-sponsor an eight-week yoga class series this semester.According to the Harvard Allston Education Portal’s website, “Yoga provides a unique opportunity to build strength and energize, while cultivating flexibility and balance, and relaxing and quieting the mind.”However, Hanna Evensen ’16 said she sees another dimension of yoga’s benefit.“Everybody just wants to bend into a flexible pretzel,” she said.

“I grew up as a child of exile, so I grew up navigating between two imaginary worlds,” said Richard Blanco, the inaugural poet for Barack Obama’s second term, in a lecture and discussion he gave on Wednesday at the Winthrop House Junior Common Room. “One was the 1950s and 1960s of my parents and my grandparents—the Cuba that they talked about in their stories, and the gossip, and their family lore.” Blanco himself never lived in Cuba, but grew up in a Cuban community in Miami. “I really believed that the America that I saw on TV really existed outside the boundaries of that realm. I really thought there was a place like ‘The Brady Bunch’ or ‘Leave It to Beaver.’”Blanco, who is also a civil engineer, spoke this past January at the inauguration, during which he read his poem “One Today.” He was the first immigrant, first openly gay, and youngest inaugural poet in history. Through his Winthrop reading, entitled “Navigating Identities,” he explored his identity as a gay Cuban-American.When Blanco speaks, it seems as if his poetry is meant to be performed—verses come to life and his voice sounds slowly and musically. “I certainly don’t do it on purpose, but it’s the internal music that you hear,” Blanco said. “It’s more like the linguistic patterns of speaking Spanish.” However, he said, he is not convinced the musical aspects of his poetry are derived entirely from speaking Spanish, and he believes that every poet has a sort of music—or lack thereof—to his or her writing.Blanco began his talk by speaking about his first collection of poems, “City of a Hundred Fires” and discussing about his struggle for cultural identity as a Cuban American. “Somewhere in between [the worlds of Cuba and America] I had to navigate a sense of who I was and where I belonged, so a lot of my work speaks to that,” he said. “We [immigrants] really hold [America] to its ideals, and I think that, since it never met those ideals, we kind of feel, ‘Well, that’s not me.’”Participating in the inaugural reading helped to change that for Blanco. “The happy ending here is that it was really during the inauguration...that I finally felt American,” he says. The most defining moment for Blanco was when President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. shook his hand. “I wasn’t expecting that, and it really was a sense of ushering me and saying...here’s your country,” he said. “And so I finally realized also that my story was an American story. I kind of never accepted that.”
He also spoke extensively on another aspect of his identity: being gay. “[It’s] one of the other things Obama made me famous for now,” he said. However, until his latest volume of poetry, “Looking for the Gulf Motel,” Blanco hadn’t written about his sexuality. “I felt like I didn’t have literarily or emotionally a story to tell that was unique,” he said. In “Looking for the Gulf Motel,” Blanco explores several intimate and humorous recollections of what he called his cultural sexuality. “I realized what was interesting me was that intersection between my culture and my sexual identity,” he said.In its evocation of specific places and times, Blanco’s poetry is very concrete as well as musical, but it is also defined by its extreme intimacy. During his talk, he gave his first reading of a selection from his forthcoming prose work that focuses on his formative relationship with his grandmother. “‘Better to have a granddaughter who’s a whore than a grandson who’s a pato-faggot like you, understand?’ [my grandmother] says with scorn in her voice,” he read. Yet a tender sadness characterizes the piece, despite these moments of intense emotion and abuse—it’s painful, but not traumatizingly so. “I’m a man when she wakes up, opens her eyes wide for a moment, looks at me and squeezes my hand, then slips away quietly, silently, dying, without a word, and I let her go,” Blanco read.Though his work and lecture addressed deep and affecting situations, Blanco’s writing has a sense of humor he retained in his delivery. Even in a poem that he said was written almost scathingly, the constant refrain of “I’ve seen you,” read in the voice of an eerily voyeuristic grandmother, roused consistent laughter from the audience. “Writing humor into poetry is very difficult; it’s a very difficult thing to pull off and still be heartwarming,” Blanco said. “But it’s also a cultural reflection. In some ways, you cannot be from a Cuban-American household and not have this tragic-comic sense to your life.”Since the inauguration, Blanco has made numerous appearances on the local and national media circuits, but once the fervor dies down he hopes to make more appearances in schools than on the news. “There’s a disconnect in America with the arts and with poetry especially,” he said. “The cause that I take away from all this is [that] I want to get into middle schools and high schools, and I want to see about how we can create a new generation of poetry readers.”—Staff writer Kurt P. Slawitschka can be reached at kurtslawitschka@college.harvard.edu.

As the numbers of practicing primary care physicians dwindle across the nation, new initiatives at Harvard to draw attention to the field of primary care are gaining momentum.Only 32 percent of students nationwide plan to enter primary care, while the remaining 68 percent are hoping to specialize in a particular field, according to survey results recently released by Kaplan Test Prep. Although the financial incentives are great—according to a 2012 survey by the Medical Group Management Association, specialty physicians on average make $150,000 more a year than their primary care counterparts—most students in the survey who claimed an interest in specialty work cited “academic interests” as their primary motivation. Only 2 percent attributed their goals to the financial incentives, according to the Kaplan survey.But many disagree that primary care is less intellectually stimulating than specialization.In response to the survey data, Tarina Quraishi ’14, a pre-med student and former secretary of the Harvard Pre-Medical Society, remarked that primary care can be just as academically stimulating as a specialization, if not more so. Quraishi said she plans to pursue a career in primary care herself.“An interdisciplinary approach can come into play [with primary care,]” Quraishi said. “You don’t necessarily get to do in a specialty.”
Oona B. Ceder ’90, director of premedical and health career advising at Harvard’s Office of Career Services, echoed the sentiment, describing primary care as “very intellectually stimulating and valuable.”She also described her office’s recent collaborations with Harvard Medical School’s newly created Center for Primary Care. Last spring, the partnership sponsored a panel discussion, “The Hows and Whys of Primary Care,” and is currently planning similar events.The Center for Primary Care is also implementing initiatives to expose medical students to the field of primary care. One such effort that the center participated in is the Crimson Care Collaborative, which has developed and implemented five community health practices in the surrounding neighborhoods of Boston staffed by Medical School students and faculty.Albert C. Yeh ’07, a Harvard Medical School student who has been involved in the Crimson Care Collaborative for the past few years, described the program as a great experience.Still, like many in his position, Yeh said he is not currently considering primary care seriously. Instead, he said he planned to pursue a longtime interest in oncology.Overall, the popularity of primary care is increasing slowly but steadily, according to Ceder.“We are seeing what appears to be a growing interest in primary care and community healthcare amongst Harvard College students and also among students at Harvard Medical School,” she said.

This article is meant to be a general tribute to Clarence Thomas, my favorite Supreme Court Justice.In a hearing in mid-January, the Supreme Court considered the competency of the lawyers of the defendant. After hearing the lawyers had attended Harvard and Yale, Clarence Thomas was heard making a snide remark about the aptitude of Yale Law students. However, the stenographer at the court’s proceedings, recorded only “Well- he did not-” before laughter drowned out the rest of a surely wondrous insult. Oh, the possibilities of what this venerable Justice might have said. A few suggestions:“attend Harvard.”“get into Harvard.”“know Harvard existed due to a horrible brain injury that forced him to attend Yale.”
According to the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/clarence-thomas-breaks-silence-in-supreme-court.html"">New York Times, experts on the Supreme Court say it has been more than 40 years since a justice remained silent during oral arguments for an entire term, much less seven years. Clearly, Justice Thomas felt his insult warranted this historic occasion.The brilliant Clarence Thomas was, in fact, a Yale graduate. He was the very best kind of Yale student—the kind that proudly displays his “Yale Sucks” bumper sticker on the mantle of his chambers because he knew it firsthand. According to his <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/clarence-thomas-breaks-silence-in-supreme-court.html"">memoir, the Justice “peeled a 15-cent price sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of [his] law degree to remind [himself] of the mistake [he’d] made by going to Yale.”Yet announcing the truth about Yale is not Justice Thomas’s only proud achievement. As a young man, Clarence Thomas had troubles with English, having spoken the African-English creole, Gullah, as a first language. So what does little Clarence Thomas do but major in English and graduate cum laude from Holy Cross University. Then in 1966 he registered for the Vietnam War draft. Yet he was rejected due to curvature of the spine. His show of backbone was not enough to straighten it.Justice Thomas has not always been so reserved however. In fact, it was his alleged loquaciousness that got him into the biggest scandal of his career. After Thomas had been confirmed to the Supreme Court, hearings were reopened when testimony from a former coworker claimed that Thomas had sexually harassed her 10 years prior.  Yet the charges were hard to prove. The testimony was only hearsay and all those who testified had left the firm on poor terms. Ultimately, the case was dismissed and the culprit who put his or her <a href=""http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/20/anita-hill-scandal-almost-sank-clarence-thomas/"">pubic hair on Thomas’s can of Coke was never brought to justice.Perhaps this explains the Justice’s reticence now. Thomas<a href=""http://media.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWE2YzdhZGI4NWY5NGM0ZDg2ZTBlYjMzYjUxOWNlZDI=""> justifies his notorious reservation on the grounds that “the media often has its own script."" Indeed, during his initial years as Supreme Court Justice, many media pundits derisively called him Antonin Scalia’s <a href=""http://newsok.com/thomas-rejects-notion-he-follows-scalia/article/3151334"">understudy. However, upon closer examination, it would appear that Scalia often changed his view to align with Thomas rather than, as most believed, the other way around.The Justice may take a consistently originalist approach to the constitution, but his relationships are anything but partisan… and all but adorable. The Justice is particularly close to Stephen G. Breyer, who happens to be diametrically opposed to Thomas ideologically. Yet the two are often <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/clarence-thomas-the-courage-of-his-convictions/article/94780"">seen in court whispering, trading quips, and passing notes. They are like the Supreme Court version of a 1980’s teen Rom-Com. When Breyer really hits it home, Thomas is heard releasing “The Laugh,” as his rolling baritone laughter is known to Supreme Court insiders.To take a moment to point out Thomas’ weaknesses, however, his Achilles’ heel is probably his Achilles’ heel. In <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/20/us/court-takes-death-penalty-challenge.html?scp=1&amp;sq=clarence%20thomas,%20achilles%20tendon&amp;st=cse"">1993, Thomas tore his Achilles tendon playing at a pickup game in the Supreme Court’s basketball court, commonly known as “the highest court in the land.”I write this homage to my favorite Justice because it is important to remember what makes The Nine representative of the population. Try as you might, nine coveted and highly powerful positions will never accurately reflect the demographics of American race, creed, and gender. In fact, the justices are strikingly unrepresentative of American demographics. For all his quips about Yale, Clarence Thomas and the rest of the justices all are Harvard or Yale graduates who reside in the upper percentiles of intelligence. With six Catholics and three Jews, not a single Justice is Protestant, though Protestants make up <a href=""http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/10/10/3587547/protestants-in-us-a-minority-for.html"">half the country. What makes them “representative” of the population is what makes them human. What makes them human is also what makes them likeable. That’s why we should take a moment to learn what makes judges human after all.Sarah R. Siskind ’14 is a government concentrator in Adams House. Her column appears on alternate Fridays.

I was recently on a panel of Harvard students at a conference when a high school student asked, “Are you ashamed that Bill O’Reilly graduated from Harvard?”As someone who <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/5/american-political-gridlock/"">arrived at Harvard as a Tea Party supporter and subsequently moderated, I recognized the questioner as the kind of arrogant liberal that is unfortunately common on campus and who contributes to Harvard’s rocky relationship with conservatives.Last week’s Crimson staff editorial entitled <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/28/do-not-enroll/"">“Warning: Do Not Enroll” was just the latest flare-up, <a href=""http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000151617"">outraging <a href=""http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/12790"">conservatives across the nation who understood its message to be that they are not welcome at Harvard.Thankfully, that was not its intended message. The editorial was a (failed) tongue-in-cheek condemnation of politicians who disingenuously attack Harvard for political gain. Its wording and tone certainly left it vulnerable to misinterpretation, but its core idea is difficult to deny.I sadly can’t read minds, but it’s difficult to believe that Senator Ted Cruz is being honest when <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/02/ted-cruz-sees-red-not-crimson-at-harvard.html"">claiming that Harvard Law was packed with commies that no one else seems to remember. Or that Mitt Romney, who spent four years at Harvard to Obama’s three, was being honest when he <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election-2012/harvard-educated-mitt-romney-rips-president-obama-spending-time-harvard-article-1.1057223?localLinksEnabled=false"">criticized President Obama for spending too much time at Harvard.
Chances are Cruz and Romney, like most politicians, are practicing the ancient art of pandering. Ridiculing egghead liberals at elite universities plays well with the Republican base.Pandering has a price, though. Like Democratic pandering on entitlements, the actions of Romney and Cruz perpetuate America’s political dysfunction. Harvard bashing is only one manifestation of many conservatives’ disdain for the liberal coastal elite. This disdain’s most harmful effect is that some conservatives now automatically dismiss research that contradicts their worldview as trash promoted by liberal hacks, rather than critically engage with it.Perfunctory disclaimer: There are clearly liberal equivalents to these conservatives.The reason the two parties seem to be on different planets is that, more or less, they are. They believe the world works in fundamentally different ways. Science offers the possibility of at least partially merging those worldviews, laying the foundation for compromise. Refusing to integrate new factual evidence into your worldview because you vote differently than the responsible researcher is indefensible and makes compromise even harder.Yet conservatives are absolutely correct that Harvard mistreats them. It’s no secret that many Harvard liberals, especially younger ones, are intolerant of opposing viewpoints. Conservatives at Harvard constantly endure insinuations that they are unfeeling, selfish, bigoted, or dumb for disagreeing with mainstream campus views. Whether it’s prominent professors making fun of Republicans in lecture, Right to Life posters being <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/10/20/group-claims-right-to-life-posters-torn-down/"">torn down, or a <a href=""http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/harvard-undergrads-try-and-fail-to-discuss-affirmative-action/"">campus-wide character assassination of a conservative student columnist, the message to conservatives is clear: you are not welcome.This liberal illiberality is tragic. Too many students here waste a unique opportunity to learn from equally intelligent other young people who think differently than they do. On a campus that prizes diversity, diversity of thought is largely squandered.I knew that I would be in the ideological minority at Harvard when I arrived, but I didn’t realize that many liberal students would deny my opinions even basic respect. Rather than justify their assumptions to me when pressed, many liberals would simply shut down the discussion by labeling my opinions racist, sexist, homophobic, or “problematic” (a catch-all word used by my least favorite kind of liberal to dismiss anything that threatens his or her belief system). I started hearing “I’m not even going to argue this” more from my peers than my parents. Some plainly said they couldn’t be friends with someone who disagreed with them on politics.The more thoughtful liberals at Harvard, the ones that have so enriched my experience, understand that having smart conservatives on campus to challenge liberal orthodoxy and groupthink is fundamental to healthy liberalism. Stereotyping all people who disagree with you as uncritical only makes you yourself uncritical. A belief system is worth nothing if it hasn’t withstood scrutiny.Conservatives are rare here: only <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/5/25/graduates-senior-survey-2012/"">13 percent of the class of 2012 leaned towards Romney. It would be dangerous for that number to drop further. Harvard liberals need to start making conservatives feel welcome before they stop enrolling entirely.So liberals: Engage. Debate empirics. Explain assumptions you’ve never had to explain before, even if they seem obvious. They are not obvious to everyone. Most of all, treat conservatives with respect and give them the benefit of the doubt. Like you, most of them are not terrible or stupid people. They just disagree with you.I told the questioner at the conference that no, I am not ashamed that Bill O’Reilly went to Harvard despite my political disagreements with him. Of course there are times I think he’s being illogical or pandering himself, but mostly I think he is an intelligent man who cares about people just as I do. He simply understands the world to work differently and consequently believes different policies will best help society. May that more Harvard liberals realize the same of their conservative classmates.Wyatt N. Troia ’14, a Crimson editorial writer, is an economics concentrator in Winthrop House.

Let me start off with a disclaimer: I’m a feminist, so I don’t actually have a sense of humor. Feminists aren’t allowed to have a sense of humor, because we’re too busy being angry and not shaving ourselves. Furthermore, we also hate free speech because we’re Maoists.But really—this is the sort of response I usually get when I try to bring up some of the problems I have with objectifying jokes: I need to lighten up, I need to get a sense of humor, I need to stop trying to “restrict free speech.” The issue with these claims is that nothing is objectively funny; certain things can really only be funny to people who have certain kinds of privilege.Take women’s bodies, for instance. Using women’s bodies as punch lines and disparaging feminists, women’s labor, and violence against women for laughs is nothing new. Women are made to listen to these sorts of jokes all the time, expected to laugh, and forced to acculturate themselves to a point where they learn to swallow any uneasiness and force a smile. And if they complain, they are told to “lighten up.” But this is very hard, because there’s a huge, heavy problem with objectifying women for laughs: Cultural acceptance of such objectification has concrete outcomes. Violence against women happens every single day, all around the world, and these sorts of jokes, this type of “humor,” normalize a way of regarding women and their bodies that is simply dangerous.This is one of the many reasons that I found Seth MacFarlane’s hosting of the Oscars to be unbearable. His jokes about women rested entirely on disparaging female bodies, made light of domestic violence, and contributed to larger, harmful social trends. In this context, suddenly it seems like much less of a coincidence that MacFarlane was happy to use a situation of domestic violence (Rihanna and Chris Brown’s relationship) as a punch line, and that in his opening number, <a href=""http://www.newser.com/story/163508/macfarlanes-boobs-song-celebrates-rape-scenes.html"">three of the scenes he mentions in which he saw an actress’s “boobs” were either rape scenes or scenes that occurred directly after a rape.But it’s ironic! So it’s fine, right? No, actually, because I guarantee you that every single woman in that room has been harassed on the street, has had her body commented on time and time again in ways that made her uncomfortable and unhappy, and that <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/health/nearly-1-in-5-women-in-us-survey-report-sexual-assault.html?_r=0"">about a fifth of the women in the room have also probably been sexually assaulted. So when someone makes jokes like this, not only is it old, and tired, and puerile, and uninteresting, but it’s also deeply offensive. And when William Shatner comes on the screen and essentially asks us to laugh at the fact that these jokes make women uncomfortable and unhappy, we are forced to ask: To whom can this actually be funny? Who is genuinely able to find women’s discomfort at being objectified to be a funny thing, in and of itself? Certainly not anyone who has experienced this discomfort or who has learned to view objectification as a source of physical danger in their lives.
MacFarlane’s sexualized <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/24/macfarlane-rihanna-chris-brown-oscars-zingers_n_2755974.html"">joke about 9-year old Quvenzhané Wallis emphasized something slightly different: the fact that there is no escape from this sort of treatment for women. It has always been implied—by culture, society, or another one of those amorphous non-identities that force us to write in the passive voice—that all a woman needs to do to avoid disparaging comments is stay chaste; that being called a whore results from misconduct on her part; that “good women” don’t get talked about like that. But just look at this little girl and the joke that was made at her expense. It was a dismissal of her talent, of all her hard work, in order to emphasize her gender, her body—a dismissal but also a terrifyingly accurate indication of the sort of treatment she can expect to receive for the rest of her life. So what do we learn from this? We are reminded that our children are taught to take these things with a smile at an early age. We are reminded that girls are sexualized from the time they are born. We are reminded that as a female person you will never be seen as neutral.So yes, Oscar night 2013 was not really a great night for women’s self-esteem, but whoop-de-doo, you say. It’s over. Let bygones be bygones. And also I’m just overreacting, because I’m a feminist, remember?But it wasn’t a one-time thing. It was just a very public example of situations that arise every single day in our country because of the cultural sense that really anything is fair game for a joke. Jokes aren’t serious! And, of course, it’s only reasonable to be offended by serious things. So it becomes impossible to object, and the rape jokes continue, and the objectification of women continues, and these things become normalized as lighthearted topics. And then violence against women happens. And then we resolutely refuse to acknowledge that these things are all interconnected in a larger, socially reinforced rape culture. And it continues. And continues. Conclusion? I’m not laughing, and I’m not sorry.Reed E. McConnell ’15, a Crimson editorial writer, is an anthropology concentrator in Quincy House.

While the human rights abuses that the PSC highlights demand recognition and rectification, Israeli Apartheid Week—in its international and local iterations—discourages civil discourse, leaving little hope that the event might promote a dialogue contributing to peace or reconciliation.The PSC is not alone in criticizing Israeli practices in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  In January, a United Nations panel presented a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/world/middleeast/un-panel-says-israeli-settlement-policy-violates-law.html"">report declaring that Israel’s transferring its citizens to settlements in Palestine violated the Geneva Conventions.  The report noted that the Israeli government maintains a “system of total segregation” in the territories, where native Israelis reap the benefits of preferential legal status while Palestinians find themselves barred from accessing basic resources such as water, education, and housing.  Days before the report’s publication, Israel <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21249431"">became the first country ever to boycott a U.N. Human Rights Council review, and the Israeli government refused to recognize the report as legitimate after its filing.Israel must come to the table on the question of the occupied territories. Unfortunately, Israeli Apartheid Week in its current form prevents exactly this type of conversation.  The campaign spreads its message through methods that are combative rather than constructive, alienating Zionist members of both the international community and the Harvard student body. Any productive dialogue on the topic of Israel-Palestine must include Zionists as well as pro-Palestinian advocates.Papering dorms with eviction notices, erecting a wall reminiscent of the separation barrier along and within the West Bank, and referring to the whole event using a word as fraught with painful history as “<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/apartheid/"">apartheid” may provoke thought for students who have not yet come to hardened positions on the conflict in the Middle East. But these acts seem even more likely to cause a knee-jerk, negative reaction among groups who necessarily make up an essential element of any peace process. Pro-Israel groups, for example, will likely feel reluctant to parley with an organization that compares Israel to the racist, universally condemned Afrikaner regime of 20th-century South Africa. Although it is clearly the point of Israel Apartheid Week to make this very comparison, it is nevertheless an analogy that ignores crucial complexities in Israel-Palestine.Moreover, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement promoted by Israeli Apartheid Week states on its <a href=""http://www.bdsmovement.net/apartheid-colonisation-occupation"">website that the existence of the state of Israel constitutes “Jewish colonization,” a conclusion that can only be reached, at best, through a gross mischaracterization of Jewish and Israeli history. Such rhetoric not only reflects a misguided reading of history, but it is also directly counter to the cause of peace and mutual understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, which can only be achieved if each nation affirms the legitimacy of the other.
In its <a href=""http://www.harvard.edu/faqs/mission-statement"">mission statement, Harvard College urges its students “to respect ideas and their free expression, and to rejoice in discovery and critical thought.”  The case of Israel and Palestine, in which elements on both sides have consistently proven intransigent in their unwillingness to recognize each other’s right to exist as a state, exemplifies the need for such open, respectful discourse among participants with differing viewpoints. Israeli Apartheid Week, unfortunately, does not pave the way for this sort of constructive dialogue and cannot be called a constructive step on the road to peace in the Middle East.

There is no debating that there are a number of question marks heading into the 2013 season for the Harvard baseball team. Out of the squad’s six leading hitters last year, only one player is still on the roster – the team has lost over 50 percent of its offensive production in the quintet. The Crimson also loses two of its top pitchers, who collectively accounted for nearly 100 innings last season. Furthermore, the team’s coaching staff has undergone a complete turnover as Bill Decker, hired out of Trinity College in the fall, has assumed the position of head coach.
Despite all the uncertainty, however, Harvard began its season with a walkoff win in the tenth inning against Bucknell, which equaled the team’s victory total in its first 17 games last year. The squad went on to drop its next three contests, but the Crimson nevertheless gained valuable experience and a much-needed opportunity to see what some of its new talent could do. Here is an overview of a few of the Crimson’s top performers from the weekend, who will most certainly have an impact going forward.<a name=""jump"">
Brandon Kregel, Sophomore OF: Kregel registered at least two hits in all but one of the team’s four games. Highlights included a triple in the tenth inning of the win over Bucknell that set up the game-winning single from Rob Wineski, as well as a 3-for-4 performance against the Bison just two days later. Kregel is currently tied for the team lead in hits, and he also boasts four of Harvard’s six extra-base knocks.
Matt Doyle, Senior RHP and Baron Davis, Junior RHP: The Crimson’s opening day starter, Doyle held Bucknell scoreless for over five innings before he ran into trouble in the sixth. But Davis entered the game and quickly worked Harvard out of the jam. In sum, the two pitchers surrendered zero earned runs, five hits, and just three walks. Depending on the progress Decker sees in the rest of his pitching staff, the Doyle/Davis combination could be effective going forward.
DJ Link, Freshman Catcher/3B: Based on the distribution of playing time in the first four games, it looks as if Link will play a significant role this season. The freshman was in the lineup every game last weekend at either catcher or DH. Link notched a hit in all four games, including a combined 5-for-8 against 19th ranked Virginia. In addition to leading the team with 3 RBIs, Link also is tied for team-best with seven hits.
Harvard resumes action this weekend with three games in Myrtle Beach, SC. Look for these performers to continue contributing significantly, and keep an eye out for other untested talent to emerge.

Stress is an all-too-familiar phenomenon around Cambridge, Mass., this time of year. Stray more than 10 steps into the Science Center, and you’re bound to hear someone wailing about a midterm, a paper, or an extra five minutes of section. Wah, wah, wah.In last week’s Around the Ivies, I offered a salute to the Ivy fans that come out to support their teams and hurl abuse at their more athletic peers. This week, I’d like to give it up for the players, struggling through the end of a physically and emotionally taxing basketball season while still hurdling the same general academic obstacles that the rest of us face.I came to the realization the other day that, given my current lifestyle, there’s almost no chance I sustain a serious injury. I walk everywhere—no risk of car or bike crash—and loaf my way through games of pickup hoops at the MAC. The biggest danger I face on a regular basis is that I tilt back too audaciously in my desk chair and concuss myself on my laundry basket.If I played Division I basketball, I would have to deal with the inevitable wear and tear on my body, in addition to the palpable risk of landing on my ankle and mangling a ligament into spaghetti. And God forbid something serious should happen. I’d probably drop out if I broke my arm. How am I supposed to stabilize and butter my Brain Break bagel with one good wing? It’s too much to contemplate.So here’s to the ones who face down that danger every week and still take their midterms, even when they have to hobble to get there. Let’s finish out the year in prime bagel-buttering shape.
COLUMBIA at HARVARDThe last time these two teams met, in the aftermath of Nemo, Columbia stunned the Crimson by a comfortable 15 points in New York, largely due to the hot-shooting hand of junior guard Steve Frankoski, who finished with 27 points and hit five of his seven three-point attempts. But Harvard will be fully aware that it can’t afford another loss and vigilant in its three-point defense. I’m anticipating an easy victory and a bounce-back performance from Crimson point guard Siyani Chambers.Pick: HarvardPRINCETON at YALEOn Feb. 9, the Bulldogs outlasted Princeton, 69-65, at Jadwin Gymnasium in what was perhaps the most impressive road win of the Ivy season. Now the Tigers travel to New Haven, where Yale has played much better basketball—the Bulldogs shoot 50.8 percent from the field at home, compared to 37.8 percent on the road, and score 16.1 more points per game. This game represents the beginning of Princeton’s three-game road gauntlet to claim the Ivy title, and it might end up being the toughest test of the bunch.Pick: YaleCORNELL at DARTMOUTHIf a basketball game is played in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?Pick: DartmouthPENN at BROWN

The  Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Eurydice,” which opens  today at the Loeb Ex at 7:30 p.m., finds its roots in the classical  age, but is anything but ancient.  The play, written by Sarah Ruhl and  directed by Madeleine F. Bersin ’14, is meant to breathe new life into  the old tale. “It  takes something that everyone is familiar with and puts a twist on it.  It’s not what you expect,” Bersin says. “It’s kind of an American take  on this in a big way…. There’s something very ‘at home’ about this  version.”This  play reinvigorates the classic myth of “Eurydice” with a reimagined  plotline and infuses it with themes that are relevant to a modern  audience. “A  huge theme in this play is moving on or lacking the ability to move  on,” says Bryan D. Kauder ’14, who plays Orpheus. “I think that  literally every character in this show struggles with that, even the  stones.”Talking  stones are just one new and bold aspect of the universe in which  “Eurydice” takes place. The staging too is unusual; the entire play  takes place in two distinct realms, an overworld and an underworld, both  of which are visible on the stage. At times actors can be seen  performing in both worlds, with the actions of the overworld  occasionally spilling into the space below. 
Regardless  of audience expectations or reactions, Bersin maintains that “Eurydice”  strays from its mythical origin, merging the serious subjects of  identity and understanding with an atmosphere that invites the audience  to laugh. “It kind of speaks its own language,” says Bersin. “You come in here, and you’re going to come along for the ride.”

University officials promoted existing mental health resources, clarified policies, and listened to student concerns in response to demands for an open dialogue on mental health at a panel discussion Thursday night.The Undergraduate Council-sponsored event, which attracted more than 60 students and other Harvard affiliates, opened with questions seeking clarification on students’ rights within the mental health system.Chief of Student Mental Health Services Katherine A. Lapierre assured students that records are confidential and only released to Resident Deans with a student’s written permission, except in cases of hospitalization. She further emphasized that despite rumors, students are never forced to take time off.“We don’t involuntarily put people on leave,” she insisted. “There is no such thing as a ‘medical leave’ when people go on a leave of absence.”Associate Secretary of the Administrative Board Brett Flehinger added that it would be illegal for the University to remove a student from campus for mental health reasons.
Lapierre said that although students returning from leaves are required to answer questions related to wellness, the intent is to ensure that students are able to handle the academic load.During the open question session, one student relayed her friends’ personal experiences with Ad Board pressure.She questioned whether students feel that they have a choice when Harvard gives a “strong recommendation” to take time off.Other students offered their own suggestions for improving mental health care, including requiring all students to complete mandatory mental health check ups, creating a health class requirement for sophomores, and assigning all students to primary mental health physicians.Lapierre said University Health Services looks for ways to improve its offerings and referenced several recent changes, including the hiring of new full-time access coordinators who schedule initial appointments, the doubling of outside appointments available to students on the Harvard health plan from 12 to 24 per academic year, and the hiring of additional full-time psychiatrists.Thursday’s panel comes just over one week after a schizophrenic student’s anonymous Crimson op-ed accused the University of failing to provide adequate financial support for students facing emergency mental health expenses.Sally C. Donahue, director of financial aid, told the crowd that her office encourages students facing unexpected medical expenses to drop in. She highlighted the Beneficiary Aid Program, which last year granted a total of $70,000 to more than 400 students facing unexpected costs.UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14, who endorsed last week’s rally for mental health, said she felt “overwhelmed” by the level of conversation at Thursday’s panel.“I’m amazed at the turnout,” she said. “We’re going to find a way to continue this dialogue in an inclusive way. Students should be able to talk about this issue on campus and get answers.”—Staff writer Quinn D. Hatoff can be reached at quinnhatoff@college.harvard.edu.

In a decision handed down Feb. 27, a federal appeals court held up a prior decision that a group of terrorism victims who won a judgment against Iran will not be allowed to claim Iranian artifacts in Harvard’s art museums as compensation for damages owed to them.According to the verdict, the plaintiffs won a default judgment in 2003, awarding them $71.5 million in monetary compensation from the government of Iran due to its involvement in a 1997 bombing in Jerusalem. When the Iranian government refused to pay damages to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs instead attempted to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/12/19/bombing-victims-seek-iranian-artifacts-from/"">lay claim to the artifacts in question, which include a large array of ancient Persian antiquities in the Harvard Arthur M. Sackler Museum, the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.The plaintiffs <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/9/20/iranian-iran-rubin-university/"">originally lost the suit in 2011 when a federal district court judge ruled that the artifacts could not be taken from Harvard as compensation.The Crimson contacted lawyers representing Harvard and Peabody Museum administrators with knowledge of the suit, all of whom either declined to or were unavailable to comment on the story.According to the verdict, the plaintiffs have sought the artifacts on the basis that they could be considered property of Iran due to their origins, enabling them to use the assets to satisfy their claims against the Iranian government.
In the 2011 verdict, Federal Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. wrote that “the plaintiffs simply are unable to establish that any item in the possession of the Museums, whether from Persepolis or elsewhere, is rightly considered to be the property of Iran.”The decision published last week confirmed this ruling. “While we are mindful of the incident that gave rise to the judgment,” the panel of three federal appeals court judges wrote, “the general rule is that foreign sovereign property in the United States is immune from attachment and execution.”The disputes over ownership largely centered on interpretation of a 1930 Iranian law regarding the excavation of antiquities within the country’s borders. According to an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Harvard asserted that the law did not automatically give the Iranian government ownership over excavated items, that the law was unenforceable outside of Iran, and that many of the artifacts were excavated before 1930.Last week’s ruling denying the plaintiffs ownership of the artifacts upheld a 2011 ruling by a lower court that enabled the University of Chicago to retain possession of its share of the artifacts in question.According to the Chronicle, had the rulings gone the other way, a precedent may have been set in American foreign policy allowing outside entities to seize foreign exhibitions on loan to American museums. This could have made foreign countries more reluctant to share exhibitions abroad.

A student and alumni activist group criticized Harvard this week for its investment in an index fund that is a major shareholder of firearm manufacturer Smith &amp; Wesson.The Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition pointed out the connection in an emailed press release on Tuesday. Although not included in the press release, a second major firearm manufacturer—Sturm, Ruger, &amp; Co., Inc.—is also linked to Harvard through the same index fund.Harvard’s connection to these gunmakers is distant.The Harvard Management Company’s <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1082621/000119312513046116/d482127d13fhr.txt"">most recent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate no direct holdings in arms manufacturers, but rather an investment in a massive portfolio of companies that represent countless industries in the American economy, including gun manufacturing. HMC manages the University’s $30 billion endowment.In these filings, HMC reported that it has nearly $3 million invested in the iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund—a portfolio of 2,000 American companies. According to financial magazine Barron’s, the Russell 2000 Index Fund is considered to be representative of changes in the broader American economy.
Harvard’s investment in the index fund drew attention from Responsible Investment at Harvard because the Russell 2000 is a major shareholder in Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger, &amp; Co., Inc., which are two of the country’s top gun manufacturers.“I think the key takeaway here is that Harvard’s money...is going to support the manufacture and production of assault weapons,” said Nicole E. Granath ’15, co-director of Responsible Investment at Harvard. She added that even though the investment is indirect, any amount of money going to gunmakers is symbolic of support for the industry.Harvard spokesperson Kevin Galvin said that while the University does not comment on specific holdings, HMC’s strategy includes both internally and externally managed investments including exchange funds that “track broad swaths of the markets.”The press release alluded to a national debate over gun control policies that has been galvanized in recent months by mass shootings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn.“Given the tragedy in Newton and the fatal shooting on campus four years ago, Harvard’s failure to address these holdings is shocking,” said Kevin S. Wang ’16 in the press release. Wang is Responsible Investment at Harvard’s investments coordinator. “Stopping gun violence should be a critical concern for the University, and severing financial ties with these companies is a good first step,” he said.Responsible Investment at Harvard’s press release added that the $244 billion pension fund for California government employees divested from index funds connected to Smith &amp; Wesson after the Newtown shooting. Several other major public pension funds across the country have done the same.Granath said her group’s discovery points to what she believes is a larger problem at Harvard—the lack of a clear, consistent policy toward weighing social concerns when making investment decisions.“Ultimately we’d love for that process to be a little more open, to have Harvard make a clear statement on what its position is when we get to sticky social issues,” she said.She said HMC has occasionally, but not consistently, adjusted investment strategy due to social concerns, such as <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/2/17/harvards-divestment-history-strong1972strong-students-a/"">when it divested from tobacco companies in 1990.To rectify what she described as a “spotty” track record, she said that HMC should issue a policy statement regarding the social impact of investments, along with an explanation of the actions it would take if its holdings violate that policy.She added that she hopes HMC’s newly created position, <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/15/sustainable-investing-vice-president/"">the vice president of sustainable investing, will lead to further clarity and action at HMC regarding the social impact of investments.“We hope that this is something that the new office will look into immediately,” she said.—Staff writer Nikita Kansra can be reached at nikitakansra@college.harvard.edu.

This is the sixth instalment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinions on thought-provoking issues.If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic ""What was Hugo Chavez’s most significant contribution?"" please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday, March 6th at 11pm.It’s Our FaultFrankly, I was not exactly surprised to discover that about half of my classmates in the now infamous Government 1310 were being accused of violating the College’s policies on academic integrity. Although I sincerely sympathize with those individuals who were falsely accused, I do not think that the University is entirely at fault here.To directly answer the question, no, Harvard does not place enough value on education. Although institutional change at the top maybe necessary, I would argue that the root of the problem truly lies with the student body itself. The scandal in Government 1310 last spring is not the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/28/fall-of-harvard-academics/"">first time a widespread cheating has occurred on campus, nor will it be the last. This problem is not caused by the Harvard faculty’s supposed apathy for undergraduate education, nor it is only a matter of institutional flaws within the system. Quite bluntly, the answer is human nature.
Unfortunately for many students, academics is simply not regarded as a worthy pursuit or a high priority and, as a result, students will choose to spend less time finishing their problem sets and completing their readings to make gains in the other areas in their life. Of course, those who are passionate about their field of study can invest most of their time in their academic pursuits; the problem is that many students do not. The vast majority of college students, not only those at Harvard, want to have everything: leadership positions, good grades, a prestigious internship, a vibrant social life, etc. without having to make the necessary personal sacrifices to reach those goals. Instead, some may turn to cutting corners and “collaborating” with others to finish their work on time, for as long as they get the grade they want, nothing else matters.Yes, the university should attempt to evaluate not only faculty members’ contribution to academia, but also how well they perform in the classroom. Nevertheless, there is nothing the university can to do to help students from acting in their self-interest.Timothy Tsai ’14 is a government concentrator in Leverett House. He is the former Director of the Inter-Collegiate Model United Nations Team.  Opportunities Outside Academics Prove FruitfulAs a graduating senior concentrating in Government with a secondary in Economics, I have enrolled in classes that have run the gamut from academically intense to those considered “joke” courses. I confess that I am guilty of having enrolled in several courses not out of rapt interest in the topic, but in an effort to balance out the substantial workload of extracurricular activities. Although, in my experience, Harvard has not placed enough value on academics, it is only because the University offers experiences that go far beyond the classroom.From connections to internships across the globe, to opportunities to manage and run conferences for thousands of attendees, Harvard’s vast resources for its students serve as much value as its classes in educating the next generation of working adults. Undoubtedly, the academic reputation of Harvard contributes to the existence of these opportunities. However, having a schedule comprised entirely of academically rigorous classes would limit the ability of many students to take full advantage of Harvard’s extracurricular learning opportunities. We are students, but our role is not only to study—but it is also to learn, and Harvard offers extraordinary resources outside of academics to do so.Charlene Wong ’13 is a government concentrator in Currier House. She is the Secretary General of World Model United Nations.A Necessary Balancing Act

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).Students at Columbia have been over-indulging in Nutella lately, and it's turned into quite the hot topic. While reports originally <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/nyregion/for-columbia-students-nutella-in-a-dining-hall-may-be-too-tempting.html"">claimed the university spent $5000 on the stuff in one week, the figure has now been <a href=""http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/missing-nutella-part-2-columbia-puts-consumption-far-below-report/"">reduced to a more modest $2500. Apparently students have been filling cups full of Nutella, or just taking full jars back to their rooms, meaning around 100 lbs was disappearing each week. Lucky for students, there are no plans to take away the delicious hazelnut treat any time in the future, leaving all of us at Flyby extremely jealous but also kind of relieved we don't have such easy access to unlimited Nutella. That 100lbs has to go somewhere, guys…<!--more-->Further north in the state of New York, Cornell has been taking things away from their students, namely three of their fraternities. Chi Psi has been suspended for ""credible allegations of serious physical hazing,"" and Sigma Nu and Delta Phi were both placed on interim suspension for the same reason. Despite the disconcerting nature of the allegations, Cornell's Robert G. Engle Associate Dean of Students, Travis Apgar, has been looking on the bright side. He <a href=""http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/March13/FratStatus.html"">said that ""[they] are pleased to see Cornell demonstrate that it is a community of action takers, not bystanders"". Yep, that's definitely the takeaway from all of this.Over in New Haven, Yale's Sex Weekend has been causing a stir. At their ""Sex: Am I Normal?"" seminar, 9% of around 55 attendees admitted to having been paid for sex, and 3% to sexual activity with an animal. The seminar has certainly fulfilled its goal of getting people talking about sexual taboos, but probably not in the way they'd hoped. News outlets jumped on the story, with <a href=""http://philly.barstoolsports.com/around-barstool/survey-one-in-ten-yale-students-is-a-prostitute/"">one site using a ""Yale School of Prostitution"" still from ""<a href=""http://simpsonswiki.net/wiki/Yale_School_of_Prostitution"">The Simpsons"" as an illustration. Ouch.Someone who definitely won't be heading to a school of prostitution any time soon (we hope) is Malia Obama, though she was seen checking out one Ivy League school this week, namely Princeton… Or not. The <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/e6rNtpy.jpg"">picture, allegedly of Malia and a student at the college, actually turned out to be a picture of two freshman friends who decided to play a prank via Twitter to see how ""news"" spreads on campus.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!Dunster House was built in 1930, and has the history (and housing) to match. Sure the nine minute walk from Dunster to the Yard isn't exactly ideal and the housing is at best subpar, but Dunster makes up for its flaws with fantastic House spirit and a dining hall that serves the best you can expect from HUDS. And if you're the type of person that values looks, Dunster House with its iconic red dome is one of the most beautiful buildings at Harvard.<!--more--> House Spirit: Dunster House does Dunster House spirit pretty damn well. Dunster ""meese"" are overflowing with D Haus pride. The stein clubs are consistently well-attended and the House's other events—its annual goat roast for instance—draw students from across Harvard's campus.Housing Quality: The quality of Dunster housing might be the its greatest shortcoming. Walk-through bedrooms are the most common setup in Dunster, and although seniors are generally guaranteed n+1 housing, juniors and sophomores consistently have to settle for n housing. Dunster's rooms are also known for being smaller than those in other Houses. The House is slated for renovation in June 2014 as part of the College's ongoing House renewal project, and hopefully that update will eliminate walk-throughs and boost Dunster in future Flyby rankings. And for now, there's always DeWolfe.
Dining Hall: The dining hall is one of the highlights of Dunster House. Covered in dark oak paneling, illuminated by chandeliers, and filled with long tables, the center of Dunster House life breeds a communal vibe and screams ""Old Harvard."" The food in Dunster's dining hall is arguably the best on campus, but most students don't realize that the trek to Dunster is worth it. As a result there are rarely long lines in the servery, meaning you'll get to the red spice chicken that much faster.Facilities: Dunster is one of the few Houses on campus with an in-House grille, meaning when another snow storm hits Harvard, you won't have to leave the comfort of your home for some late night mozz sticks. The library boasts the same classic architectural vibe that gives the rest of Dunster its charm. The House also has a pottery room that offers semester-long courses and six squash courts, some of which have been converted into a weight room, cardio room, indoor basketball court, and indoor volleyball court.House Masters: Government Professor Roger B. Porter and his wife, Ann Porter, are among the longest-serving House masters at Harvard. The Porters are pleasant and loving leaders of Dunster. They rarely introduce new events or ideas into House life, but there's something to be said for sticking to and maintaining traditions.Extra: Part of what makes Dunster so unique is its annual events, including the Dunster House Opera, the goat roast, and the Hoedown Throwdown. The House has been home to a long list of celebrities, including Al Gore '69, Tommy Lee Jones '69, Norman K. Mailer '43, and Deval L. Patrick '78. Dunster may not be the most centrally located of Houses, but at least it's one of the closest to Trader Joe's. And hey, at least it isn't the Quad.Our rankings so far:11.

UPDATED: March 8, 2013, at 6:31 p.m.Heavy snowfall in Cambridge slowed traffic across the city on Friday. But on JFK Street near Harvard, traffic stopped completely. On Friday morning, underground electrical cables ignited, causing a manhole fire and prompting Cambridge Police to temporarily close JFK Street between Mount Auburn Street and Memorial Drive.The incapacitated cables caused power outages for 700 customers of NSTAR Electric and Gas, the city’s electricity provider, according to NSTAR spokesperson Michael Durand. He said the incident was probably not related to the snowstorm.NSTAR received reports of a smoking manhole at the intersection of JFK Street and Winthrop Street at around 11 a.m., Durand said. The smoldering, he said, was due to energy released when the cables failed.The cables burned for about an hour, according to Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Chief Francis E. Murphy III, before firefighters dumped water onto the cables and extinguished the fire. NSTAR restored power for all but 100 customers within the hour, and expects to have all customers back online by 7 p.m., Durand said.
Traffic signals at the corner of JFK Street and Memorial Drive were without power due to the incapacitated cables, so state police directed traffic for some of the afternoon, according to a statement on the Cambridge Police Department website asking motorists to avoid the area.University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email that 65-67 Winthrop Street, which houses Harvard University Dining Services offices, was the only Harvard building to lose power.Soon after the fire was put out, Mount Auburn Street reopened entirely, and by around 2 p,m., all of JFK Street was open to vehicles. NSTAR employees remained at work on the scene.Firefighters, police, and electrical workers attended to the cables and closed streets as heavy snow fell on the greater Boston area. As of 1 p.m., more than a foot of snow had fallen in the area, and the National Weather Service extended its winter storm warning until 7 p.m. for Eastern Massachusetts.MBTA subway service remained unaffected by the storm Friday afternoon, except for the replacement of Mattapan Line trolleys with buses due to “weather-related issues.”According to the NWS, snow showers will be mostly finished by 9 p.m., and the area can expect sunny weather with a high of 42 degrees on Saturday.—Staff writer Samuel Y.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.March 3, 1913: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1913/3/3/unique-picture-exhibited-in-fogg-pa/"">Unique Picture Exhibited in FoggA rare and valuable picture of Geoffrey Chaucer, the English poet, which was bequeathed to the Harvard College Library by Professor Charles Eliot Norton, has recently been placed on exhibition in the Fogg Museum. The portrait was at Llanshaw Court, in Gloucester-shire, for more than three centuries. It bears a close resemblance to the only known authentic portrait of Chaucer, the miniature in Occleve's ""De regimine principum,"" written in 1411-12, and also to a later full-length portrait in another British Museum manuscript. It has been known in recent years as the Seddon portrait. Mr. James Loeb presented it to Professor Norton, who bequeathed it to the Library with the request that it be inscribed as a memorial of two lovers of Chaucer,—Francis James Child and James Russell Lowell.March 4, 1931: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1931/3/4/crane-gave-bells-for-lowell-tower/"">Crane Gave Bells for Lowell TowerCharles Richard Crane, Hon. '22, head of the Crane Manufacturing Company of Chicago, yesterday was revealed as the hitherto anonymous donor of the Lowell House bells, thus disposing of the rumor that they were the gift of President Lowell.
<!--more-->Mr. Crane, although never a student at Harvard, was awarded an honorary degree of LL.D. by the University in 1922 as having ""sustained innumerable projects artistic, scientific and philanthropic,"" in the words of the official citation accompanying the degree.March 8, 1958: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1958/3/8/groundbreaking-sparks-program-pthe-call-of/"">Groundbreaking Sparks 'Program'The call of the golden spade yesterday summoned alumni from Boston and New York to begin the second big push of the Program for Harvard College. About 500 area chairmen and captains returned to Cambridge to speak, to watch, and to listen, as the drive for the ""thinner cats"" began.In addition to breaking ground for Quincy House, yesterday's festivities put into motion the Boston and New York solicitation campaign which will begin in earnest after Harvard's Day on March 28.With most of the ""fat cats"" solicitation out of the way, the Program, which as of yesterday had garnered $34,250,000, turned to the prospects expected to contribute less than $100,000.March 3, 1962: <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1962/3/3/congressman-claims-mta-should-sell-to/"">Congressman Claims MTA Should Sell to UniversityWASHINGTON, March 2—The Congressman whose district includes Harvard said today that the Bennett St. Yards of the Metropolitan Transit Authority should go to the University for the construction of a tenth house.Rep. Thomas P. O'Neill, a Democrat, whom the eleventh district has reelected four times, told the CRIMSON that selling the land to anyone besides Harvard would ""spoil the continuity of the University area.""However, O'Neill added, University officials should meet on ""friendly terms"" with the city to ""make a respectable offer of tax revenues which the property would yield Cambridge in the future.""

With 32 seconds left to play in Friday night’s rematch against Columbia, sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi stole the ball in the backcourt, took it the length of the floor, and hammered home an uncontested dunk. The basket pushed his team’s slim advantage to three points, and for the first time all night, Harvard was able to hold off the Lions, and hold on for the win.Despite a late jumper from Columbia’s Grant Mullins, four Harvard free throws—two from sophomore Kenyatta Smith and one apiece from Moundou-Missi and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers—sealed the deal for the Crimson.“It seems like another typical night in the Ivy League for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[I am] obviously just really thrilled for us to gut this one out.”Harvard eventually pulled off a 56-51 comeback victory against the Lions (12-16, 4-10 Ivy). And with that, the roller coaster that has been this season of Ivy League basketball took another dramatic turn. Harvard’s win, paired with a Princeton loss at the hands of Yale, rocketed the Crimson (19-9, 11-3) back into first place in league standings, just one half game ahead of the Tigers (16-11, 9-4) with three relevant contests still to play.“We try to come out here not worrying about [Princeton’s] game and focusing on our game,” Saunders said. “But knowing that they did lose, that we are competing for a share of the title, is very exciting.”
Down four with 1:22 left in the game, Moundou-Missi converted two free throws after a Mark Cisco foul on the floor, ushering in an 11-2 Crimson run to close the game. After the ensuing possession, Moundou-Missi pulled down a defensive board and found Chambers, who took the ball the length of the floor and converted an and-one layup to give the Crimson a one-point advantage with 40 seconds to go. From there, it was all Harvard, as the Crimson maintained its slim advantage.After trailing the entirety of the opening frame, Harvard came out strong in the second half, outscoring the Lions 8-0 over 1:38 near the start of the second, on a Saunders and-one, a three from Rivard, and a transition layup from Chambers. The freshman’s layup, which came off a turnover from Columbia’s Brian Barbour, knotted the game at 30 with 16:50 to play.“You can’t say enough about Chambers,” Amaker said. “What more can he do for the team—his minutes, his effort, his moxie, his savvy, his daring.”Harvard took its first lead over the Lions, 35-34, off of a Saunders three-pointer in the half’s seventh minute. From there, the game was back-and-forth, with neither team claiming more than a four-point lead until Harvard went ahead by five with 11 seconds to go.Columbia bolstered its lead to four at the six-minute mark, as Mullins converted a three-point attempt.And though the Lions threatened to stretch that lead further with two offensive rebounds—Columbia finished with 14 offensive boards to the Crimson’s five—within a minute of each other at 4:21 and 3:45, the Crimson was able to hold off the offensive onslaught after Moundou-Missi grabbed a defensive board at 3:21.“I’m proud of our kids for putting us in a position to [win the league title on Saturday] considering the journey we have gone through this year,” Amaker said. “We talked about playing through the weekend and then picking our heads up.”In an effective must-win game for a Harvard team that was then still hoping to find a way into the NCAA Tournament, Columbia held a 28-22 advantage over the Crimson at halftime.The Lions jumped out to an eight-point lead thanks in large part to seven points in the first 7:34 from Alex Rosenberg. But Harvard was able to close the gap to three after a Laurent Rivard long ball with 11:39 to go and again at 5:23 on a layup from sophomore Wesley Saunders.Columbia added to its advantage on an ensuing 7-2 run to capture an eight-point lead, finished off by a Rosenberg three with 2:41 left in the half. From there, despite an and-one from Saunders and one layup apiece from Chambers and co-captain Christian Webster, the Lions were able to close the half with a six-point advantage.Rosenberg led all players with 12 points in the first half on four-of-five shooting, including two makes from deep, but Harvard was able to stall his momentum in the second, allowing just two more points from the forward. Chambers paced all players with a game-high 16 points. And despite its first-half offensive struggles, the Crimson was able to reclaim its spot atop the conference standings, a spot it secured after Saturday’s win over Cornell.Smith and Moundou-Missi combined for 17 points and 16 rebounds on the night, while Smith tallied all six of Harvard’s blocks.“It’s a great position to be in,” Saunders said. “Before, we were kind of down because we dropped both [games] last weekend, but now we just have to take care of business and do what we need to do.”—Staff writer Catherine E.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!When you imagined your life as an upperclassman at Harvard, you did not imagine Currier House. It's not even partly neo-Georgian, and unlike Mather it's got no river views. Currier is no freshman's top choice. But those who live there learn to love it, and for good reason (not to mention out of necessity). As Stephen Stills would advise, if you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with.<!--more-->House Spirit: Timete Arborem. Fear the Tree. New Currierites tend to think of the revered tree as hokey, not to mention a poor consolation prize for the unfortunate location and questionable aesthetics of their House. Soon, however, they, too, grow affectionate towards the feared tree.
 Currier residents describe their House as tight-knit—it's the type of place where you can go into the dining hall and sit with a random person and there's a good chance that they'll be friendly. One hallway leads to giant common spaces and filters into the dining hall, and people are always around. Say what you will about Currier, at least it's totally internally connected, which comes in handy when it snows. Unfortunately, that internal connectivity does not extend to the Yard or the River. Housing Quality: What Quadlings lose in proximity to the Yard, they gain in space. Currier has many singles, which often include their own bathrooms. It's possible for sophomores to have singles, with their own private bathrooms and common rooms. These are the perks of living in the Quad. There are also a few giant suites, including the coveted Currier Ten-Man, ten singles that surround a huge suite common room. Then there's the Solariums—the tops of the towers—which are comprised of three penthouse balcony suites. Plus, no creepy, crawly insects. There are mice, though. Dining Hall: The dining hall is the social hub of the House. Some residents even trek back to the Quad for lunch just because they love the chefs, the food, and the environment so much. Facilities: Currier is filled with awesome common rooms of all sizes.The Fishbowl, a common space and entertainment center where people can watch the Superbowl or random movies on a 13-foot projector (which Currier students claim is the largest television on campus) is awesome, and a rather unique feature. The Mousehole is a fun common space with couches, a television, and grand piano, which you can sometimes hear people playing at 3:00 a.m. (Whether or not that's a good thing we'll leave for you to decide). The Gilbert Living Room, specifically for people in the tower, has a bunch of couches, a dining room, a piano in the back, and a kitchen. Actually, you can find a kitchen pretty much anywhere here. There are so many kitchens in Currier. Other Currier facilities include a cardio room, a weight room, and a dance studio.

“There’s  a Disney ride,” one audience member deadpanned as the hot air balloon  holding the man destined to become the Wizard of Oz careened down a  precipitous and preposterously cerulean waterfall. And it’s  true—Disney’s “Oz the Great and Powerful” is every inch an advertisement  for the roller coasters, action figures, and perhaps even sequels that  will follow in its wake. But the film, directed by Sam Raimi, doesn’t  pretend for a moment that it is anything else. Irreverent yet lovingly  referential, and gorgeous to boot, “Oz” is a film that mirrors its  protagonist: manipulative, but more than capable of putting on a good  show. “Oz”  is the latest in a spate of films—not to mention musicals and TV  shows—that gather their box office momentum by reimagining classic  tales. Like “Wicked,” it is a prequel to the storied “The Wizard of Oz,”  but where Gregory Maguire’s novel and the subsequent Broadway  blockbuster asked us to forget the Oz we thought we knew, this spinoff  encourages us to revel in it. The movie chronicles how a carnival  magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) becomes the Wizard of Oz. The  film spends most of its 127 minutes winking at the audience. Its  favorite trick is to pull a cliché in for a bear hug even as it turns it  on its ear. The yellow brick road is there, all right, but one  character complains of yellow brick potholes. As the wizard is conveyed  via tornado to Oz, the bicycling neighbor in the original is replaced by  a floating caravan, which hurtles back at the wizard and punctures his  balloon. Oz and his comrades encounter a lion in the woods, but this  feline shows no signs of being cowardly or capable of speech. An  impression of homage flirting with parody is sustained throughout the  film. It’s a loving contrast that lends “Oz” vitality and encourages us  to forgive its plodding over well-trodden ground.
 A  200-million-dollar major motion picture cannot be labeled camp (if this  is camp, it is the air-conditioned-cabins, day-trips-to-Six-Flags  variety)—a better descriptor for “Oz” may be ebulliently self-aware. The  dialogue is stilted, the characters are caricatures, but everyone is in  on the joke—no one more so than the film’s star, Franco, whose Oscar  Diggs aspires to Houdini-Edison hybridity. As Glinda (Michelle Williams)  describes him, he is “selfish, slightly egotistical, and a fibber.”  Nevertheless, you root for the guy—or rather, you root for Franco. It is  clear from the outset that this is not the Franco of “Howl” or “127  Hours,” but the Franco of “General Hospital” and “Saturday Night Live.”  He hams it up as best he can, and as is often the case with Franco, his  best is pretty darn good. Williams and Mila Kunis, as Glinda and the  wicked witch Theodora, follow Franco’s lead, gamely trading shameless  doe eyes and face-contorting snarls as occasion requires. The trio is  spectacularly unafraid to overdo it, and they seem a ruby slipper’s  length away from breaking the fourth wall. The  film’s charm is bolstered as much by 3D glasses as it is by  two-dimensional characters. Raimi’s Oz is beautifully overdone, all  bright colors and absurd architecture. Far from cheapening these  visuals, the three-dimensionality of “Oz” underpins the celebration of  artifice that pervades the film as a whole. This mood is further  reinforced by a jocular score from the ubiquitous Danny Elfman and a  delectable array of costumes designed by Gary Jones. Elfman  and Jones might have lent a hand to screenwriter Mitchell Kapner in  keeping the film interesting. Perhaps unsurprisingly given its prequel  status, “Oz” is weakest when it comes to plot. The backstory that  explains the ascent to power of the witch Evanora and why the citizens  of Oz feel in need of a wizard is poorly fleshed out. And the poisoned  apple that triggers a female character’s descent into madness may read  as an uncomfortable biblical allusion. But  these are trivial faults for a film that is intentionally ludicrous.  “Oz the Great and Powerful” will not collect any gold statuettes, but it  does not remotely expect to. Where previous films of this ilk, such as  Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland,” have fumbled by taking themselves  too seriously, “Oz” succeeds by reveling in its frivolity. —Staff writer Emma R. Adler can be reached at emmaadler@college.harvard.edu.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!If Houses had relationship statuses, Leverett would be the friend-zone. Between housing and the Masters, there's a lot to really really like, and yet Lev is still in search of love. All the descriptions below come with the huge caveat that Old Lev (McKinlock Hall) will be renovated next school year, improving housing, facilities, and the dining hall significantly. Perhaps puberty will succeed in catapulting this perpetually unobjectionable House into the hearts of millions. Or hundreds, at least.<!--more--> House Spirit: As a freshman, you probably didn't know that much about Lev. Residents, whether they were current sophomores or seniors, all reiterated stories of not really knowing what to think when they were assigned Lev on Housing Day. One reason for the lackluster spirit may well be Leverett's size—it's the largest House (with over 100 students more than Kirkland), and it shows. Leverettites do, however, praise their HoCo for becoming more inclusive and responsive in recent semesters.Housing Quality: Leverett currently has a good variety of housing options, split between the modern F and G Towers and McKinlock, which offers the classic Harvard residential experience. Because sophomores participate in the housing lotteries, they get to know Leverett well early on as they pore over floor plans and scout out potential suites. Suites in McKinlock are roomy, though the age of the building is audible in its noisy radiators and creaky floors. In the Towers, sophomores are generally put into quints with a massive common room and a mix of singles and doubles. Juniors and seniors typically live higher up in the Towers, trading in the common rooms for larger singles and better views.Dining Hall: Humanities and social science concentrators—the essay writers—are inclined to describe their dining hall as pretty good, if crowded at times. However, science and math concentrators—the p-setters among us—uniformly rave about the dining hall as a place for late night (and painfully early morning) camaraderie. This is especially true on Wednesday nights, when the dining hall is stuffed to the gills with students there for a) Physics night and b) the piles of baked goods that ""Chief"" (see below for explanation) makes sure to replenish often.
The food itself receives average ratings, but Leverettites do have some special perks. For community dinners, Chef Chad Campo whips up a special treat each Thursday night—this week, bananas brulée; last week, homemade potato chips. The absence of lox at Sunday brunches is offset by the presence of a special omelette bar. Tea, soda, and cereal is always accessible in the dining hall. And residents rushing back from a long day will be happy to know that there is warm food to be found in the servery far longer than you'd expect.Facilities: The facilities are Leverett's weakest point. The JCR is a stately-looking meeting place; the Old Library is a popular place for rehearsals and productions; the actual library, housed between the Towers and McKinlock, is small but serviceable. But the common rooms in the Towers are underutilized, and we noticed a stack of sofas in F Tower that have seemingly never been used.  In general, the lack of common space is a pressing issue for Lev and undoubtedly contributes to the lackluster House spirit. We're looking forward to seeing this remedied with the renewal of Old Lev next year, which will bring with it renovated studios and rec rooms.House Masters: Howard Georgi '68 and Ann Georgi—far better known as ""Chief"" and ""Coach,"" respectively—are the greatest rallying points for Leverett House. Chief, with his ""photographic"" memory, prides himself on getting to know nearly everyone in his House. One sophomore joked, ""I was disappointed that Chief didn't know my name at the Housing Day welcome dinner,"" mere hours after she was lotteried into the House. ""But the next time I saw him, a few days later, he had it down."" The Masters' Open Houses are famed events on campus, an occasion to mingle with fellow Leverettites as well as every other monkeybread fanatic on campus. Students also cite events such as Chief's weekly ""Not Just Sherry Hour"" and the pre-exams ""Donut Bash"" in describing the Georgis as ""the model Masters.""Extra: Leverett's web presence is great, between its attractive <a href=""http://leverett.harvard.edu/index.php"">website and Chief's <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/leveretthouse/"">Flickr account, where he has posted over ten thousand photos highlighting House life. Finally, Leverettites describe their House's location as ideal: McKinlock is on the River, they're bordering most of the River Houses, and they are close enough to make use of the Mather Express on particularly foul days. Keep in mind, though, that most Leverettites must walk outside to get to their dining hall... undoubtedly a first world problem, but hey, we know these things matter to you.Our rankings so far:10. Leverett11. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/series/the-housing-market-2013/article/2013/3/8/2013-dunster-house/#jump"">Dunster12. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/series/the-housing-market-2013/article/2013/3/8/2013-currier-house/"">CurrierDisclaimer: Flyby's 2013 House Rankings, though unscientific, are based on careful research and review by the Flyby Staff.

In fact, while Georgi graduated from Harvard in 1967, he is a member of the Class of 1968.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!Mather residents will be the first to tell you that the best thing about living in Mather is that you don't have to look at it. Inside the Brutal exterior, Matherites enjoy some of the nicest spaces on the river: singles all three years, a cozy dining hall with a river view, and spacious common spaces, among other top-notch amenities. Once you're in Mather, most say, you won't want to leave. The trouble is getting there in the first place. For all of the House's benefits, location is not one of them.<!--more--> House Spirit: Mather residents say their House lacks the spirit it was once <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/series/the-housing-market-2009/article/2009/3/15/the-housing-crisis-mather-house/"">famous for. With a HoCo that is a bit insular and relatively few House events, residents say their love House spirit comes more from their group of friends than the community as a whole. Still, Mather has a handful of big-ticket events. The most (in)famous of these is <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/19/mather-lather-x/"">Mather Lather, the soapy rite of spring that takes place each year. Mather also has an ongoing series of intrahouse competitions called the Louie Cup, named after neighboring Louie's Superette.Housing Quality: Housing is Mather's best feature. It is the only House where everyone—actually everyone—is guaranteed a single. Most sophomores live in the House's low-rise building, where split-level suites are the norm, while juniors and seniors tend to gravitate to Mather Tower, which boasts 18 floors of huge stand-alone singles.Students looking for the classic Harvard experience will not find it here. Mather's rooms are a pastiche of concrete, carpet, and other mysterious composite materials. Dark hallways, especially in the House's low-rise wings, can be depressing and overrun with lost fêtards on a Friday night, but residents say huge windows and pest-free rooms more than make up for fluorescent entryways. Though their rooms are less conducive to partying, residents living in the Tower enjoy some of the best views in the area, along with the benefit of a space all their own.
Dining Hall: Mather dining hall is famous for its beautiful view of the Charles. Dinner at sunset is a unique treat for those who trek this far from the Yard. That said, most people eating in Mather on any given day are likely residents. The insularity makes for a warm and friendly dining experience, while ensuring that Mather regulars have plenty of space to spread out. Though the food is average, the kitchen is spacious, and the HUDS staff are accommodating.Facilities: Built of reddish and grey concrete in the late 1960s and opened in 1970, Mather is no one's image of Harvard. But what it lacks in red brick and white paint it more than makes up for with huge amounts of common space. The gym and library are both among the biggest on the river. For study breaks, typical Junior and Senior Common Rooms are supplemented by a dedicated television room, pool tables, and ping pong tables. If couches and lounge chairs scattered around the House aren't enough for the weary, Mather has a Tranquility Room described on the House's website as ""designed to imbue visitors with the sense of peace its name evokes.""Though Mather was historically a jock House, today it is home to some of the best art spaces on campus, with several music practice rooms, a pottery studio, a woodturning studio, and a multimedia room. The Three Columns Gallery between the dining hall and library features student art year round.House Masters: Mather residents say they have little attachment to their masters, Christie A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten. But McDonald, a professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literature, and Rosengarten, an adjunct professor of Medicine at McGill University, have done a lot to reinvigorate the House's art scene and senior common room in the last few years.Extra: Mather's biggest drawback is its location. At a brisk pace, the walk from the front gate to the Yard takes ten minutes. Residents will be quick to tell you that the Mather shuttle stop, proximity to Louie's convenience store, and adjacency to the river compensate for the House's distance from the Yard. You can be the judge.Our rankings so far:9.

Harvard administrators secretly accessed the email accounts of 16 resident deans in an attempt to determine who leaked communication regarding the Government 1310 cheating scandal that made its way to the media, the <a href=""http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/03/09/harvard-university-administrators-secretly-searched-deans-email-accounts-hunting-for-media-leak/d5lYY8vXLyZQYWtTNGxWkL/story.html"">Boston Globe reported on Saturday evening.The searches, reported on the basis of interviews with “several Harvard officials,” were for the origin of the leak of an internal email sent on Aug. 16 by Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison, the Globe reported. That internal email, in which Ellison advised his colleagues about how to counsel athletes and other students implicated in the scandal, had been forwarded by a resident dean to one of his students. The contents of that email were <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/1/ad-board-accused-students/"">reported in The Crimson on Sept. 1, two days after the scandal broke.Administrators informed the resident dean who had forwarded Ellison’s email of the search shortly after it occurred, but did not tell the other resident deans until after being approached by the Globe on Thursday. The resident dean in question, like all resident deans, sits on the Ad Board, the disciplinary body that handled the cases of alleged cheating.The Globe article noted that administrators searched one of two Harvard email accounts belonging to resident deans—the account for administrative matters, rather than for personal ones. Also, Harvard information technology employees were told to look only for certain email subject lines and not to read the contents of messages themselves, the Globe reported.Faculty of Arts and Sciences policy allows administrators to access faculty email accounts in “extraordinary circumstances such as legal proceedings and internal Harvard investigations,” according to a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:VY4vMC670QUJ:www.security.harvard.edu/files/Security_-_Faculty%2520Privacy%2520Advisory%25205.13.10.doc+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShJlNAJYhCt8gEyqxRoLhVCkWs7jwvrpID5dZ5ASGriyNsJuq7wPDiJ6IEAFgXLZb2MP9wjkuzrTO-KyCl6Kpb4b5GlDvWOW2uW6GwxoBtmVZB5_jcnRkkYy0EaV2FqW7Vykp9o&amp;sig=AHIEtbQdz4AABsKpX-GaHDTuSZVlzwsAqA"">document on Harvard’s Information Security and Privacy website. In such cases, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Office of the General Counsel must approve such a review, and the faculty member must be notified.
Resident deans, though, are not technically faculty. They are listed as “House Staff” on the <a href=""http://osl.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k65178&amp;pageid=icb.page296399"">Office of Student Life’s website and hold an administrative appointment which comes with some faculty privileges, but it is unclear what rules guide administrative access to their email accounts.In a statement, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith did not rule out searching email accounts. He said that Harvard would take “all necessary and appropriate actions under our procedures to safeguard the integrity” of the Ad Board process if given reason to believe that the process had been “compromised.” He added that he would agree to take steps that struck a “balance between our needs to respect the privacy of our employees and to protect the privacy of our students.”—Michelle Denise L.

Though the Harvard men’s basketball game was long over, a sizable crowd lingered at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night, huddled around various computer screens, eagerly awaiting updates on made and missed free throws taken 60 miles away. The Crimson had just closed out a victory over Cornell, 65-56, and with that, captured a share of the Ivy crown.But a bigger story was in the works in Providence, R.I. Princeton—the lone team that held complete control over its Ancient Eight championship chances at the start of the weekend—was trailing a Brown team with a sub-.500 conference record and just a few minutes left to play.Despite getting within five with as few as 40 seconds remaining after two free throws from guard TJ Bray, the Tigers were unable to close the gap any further, eventually falling to the Bears, 80-67.And with that, less than an hour after <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/9/mbb-cornell-recap-030913/"">securing at least a share of its third straight Ivy title, the Crimson became the second squad in the country to punch a ticket to the 2013 NCAA Tournament.“I just feel like the basketball gods have been on our sides the entire way,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “To know that we had two home games down the stretch and Princeton had three road games, as Coach said, we would have killed to get in this position, so we are so grateful.”
After an audible yell from the hallway, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker reentered the conference room on the second floor, beaming as he addressed his co-captains and then the press for the second time that evening.“We’re thrilled about the fact that we are Ivy League champions outright,” Amaker said. “This obviously is a tough league, as anyone who has been a part of it will tell you. As challenging as this 14-game tournament really is, we talk about how challenging it is to win on the road.”Amaker’s squad will play on college basketball’s biggest stage for the second time in as many years and the third time in program history. Last season, Harvard fell to Vanderbilt, 79-70, in the second round of tournament play at The Pit in Albuquerque, N.M. Two years ago, the Crimson narrowly missed out on NCAA Tournament play, as then-junior Doug Davis beat the buzzer with a jumper to push Princeton past the Crimson in a one-game playoff for the automatic bid.After co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew from school before the start of the 2012-13 campaign, the preseason media poll tabbed Princeton as the favorite to claim this year’s Ivy title. But Harvard, despite dropping two games last weekend, was able to successfully defend its second championship in school history.“We always talk about standards, and that is what we live by, not focusing on what other people say about us,” Webster said. “That’s something that we have done all season.... We lost those great guys and those great players but we came here for a reason and that’s to win Ivy League championships.”Heading into the final weekend of Ancient Eight play, the Crimson sat half a game behind Princeton after suffering two consecutive road losses at the hands of the Tigers and Penn, respectively, to fall out of first place in the conference standings.“We lost to a [Penn] team [and] we feel we could have won that game if we had played better,"" Rivard said. ""We worked hard all [this] week like we worked hard all season and we had to take care of our business.”With two games left to play, Harvard needed to sweep Cornell and Columbia this weekend and hope that the Tigers lost at least one game of their remaining three. Two Harvard wins paired with a single Princeton loss would have set the stage for a playoff to determine which team would claim the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the Big Dance.But Yale and Brown did one better, as Princeton lost both of its games this weekend, handing the Crimson the outright title and opportunity to dance. After closing out the regular season with two wins at home, the Crimson awaits news of its next opponent on Selection Sunday.“It’s an incredible testament to these two young men who were able to make this happen for our program,” Amaker said of Rivard and Webster. “We are thrilled to be playing in the NCAA Tournament.”—Staff writer Catherine E.

For most of its late season surge, the Harvard men’s hockey team (10-19-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) has mainly relied on its senior class, a talented group of veterans looking to salvage its last season with the Crimson after a slow start.But on Friday night in the opening game of the ECAC playoffs at Thompson Arena, the rookies stole the show, netting two goals and propelling Harvard to a 2-1 upset victory over Dartmouth to gain a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three series in the first-round of the ECAC conference tournament.“Obviously it’s playoff hockey and we are excited every game, but we had a fire going into Friday,” junior defenseman John Caldwell said. “We had something to prove; we haven’t had the greatest season in the world so we are a little frustrated, and we wanted to prove something.”The Crimson jumped in front with the first goal of the game in the second period from freshman defenseman Desmond Bergin, but the Big Green (15-12-5, 9-9-4 ECAC) came back midway through the third to knot the score at one.The score stayed that way until just under three minutes remained in the contest.
After a series of passes from freshman Kyle Criscuolo and senior Marshall Everson, freshman Brian Hart fired a shot at the Dartmouth net. Initially blocked by Big Green goalie Cab Morris, Hart followed up on his shot, collected his own rebound and found the back of the net.“The freshmen have actually been great this year, they came in and assumed a pretty big role on the team early on and have helped us all season,” Caldwell said. “Normally there is a learning curve for a lot of the freshmen as they come in and get adjusted to the speed of the game…but our guys have been really good even from the beginning to get out there and get the knack of it really quickly and really contribute to the team…so it’s no surprise that they scored on Friday.”The Crimson was able to withstand Dartmouth’s final empty-net push, with junior netminder Raphael Girard coming up with several of his 39 saves on the night in front of the Harvard net.The Crimson is 4-0 when capturing the first game of the first-round series, last winning in 2011 when it upset Clarkson in a similar late-season run. But in that same season the Big Green was able to come back after falling in the first game of the quarterfinal series against Harvard.Friday night’s game marks Bergin’s first appearance since injuring his ankle back on Jan. 12 against Dartmouth in Thompson Arena. He made his presence felt immediately with his second period goal, his second of the season.“Desmond is a talented defenseman; he’s good offensively and defensively,” Girard said. “Also it brings a man back to the roster which is pretty short on numbers, it allows us to play John Caldwell on forward who is a physical presence out there so it gives us more depth overall everywhere.”Freshman forward Greg Gozzo passed the puck back up along the right boards to junior defenseman Danny Fick, who then sent a pass along the blue line to Bergin waiting at the left point. Bergin collected the puck and fired a slapshot through traffic and into the net.Dartmouth responded with a goal from Jesse Beamish, who netted the game-winner against the Crimson in the January contest. Tim O’Brien and Charlie Mosey were attributed with assists on the play.Hart’s game-winner at 17:15 in the third was his fifth of the season and 18th point of the year, now tied with Ivy League Rookie of the Year Jimmy Vesey for second on the team in points, one behind assistant captain Alex Fallstrom.The goal came on a counter attack, with the Big Green rush initially broken up by Everson. Criscuolo found the puck, made a short pass back to Everson, who then bounced the puck off the left boards to Hart near the blue line. Hart skated up along the left side, fired a wrist shot at Morris and then capitalized on his second chance on the rebound.“We are excited about the win,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But we realize that this is one [and] you need two and they are a very good hockey team so we expect the intensity that was in the third period to be there all three periods [Saturday] night.”—Staff writer David A.

Imagine waking up on a Sunday morning with the following notice on your door: “We must nurse our children and grandchildren on hatred for Zionists and for Jews... These bloodsuckers who attack the Palestinians, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs.”  This would be disturbing, out-of-context, and highly inflammatory.The hypothetical posting of Egyptian President <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/world/middleeast/egypts-morsi-says-slurs-of-jews-were-taken-out-of-context.html"">Morsi’s recent hateful statements on students’ doors across campus, like the “eviction notices” distributed by the Palestine Solidarity Committee last weekend, violate the tradition of open and intellectual discourse valued at Harvard. Evictions and demolitions are important issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict, as are <a href=""http://www.memritv.org/search/en/results/0/0/0/%7C/1/0/0/0/0.htm?k=jews%20jewish&amp;bAdvSearch=true"">anti-Semitism and incitement throughout the Arab world. However, presented without a balanced explanation, these issues are reduced to polarizing discourse that are counterproductive to reaching a mutual understanding. This was exhibited in the PSC’s launch of their so-called “Israeli Apartheid Week”— a dishonest and imbalanced method of engagement.As two seniors writing theses on aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict, we have actively sought out views that oppose our own and continue to work in an effort to understand contradicting narratives. Through our research and combined eight months of living experience in Israel over the past year, we found barriers to peace attributable to both Israel and the Palestinians. We realize the importance of employing a framework that engages with multiples perspectives. There are limits to this framework, however, when words are based in hatred rather than facts. The Palestinian Solidarity Committee has reached this limit in its portrayals of the conflict as one-sided, revealing either a lack of understanding of history or rejection of an honest, albeit challenging, conversation about the complicated reality.The PSC’s use of the word “apartheid” is ahistorical, polarizing, and preventative of informed, fact-based dialogue. The implication of the comparison to “apartheid” is that the Israelis are racist totalitarians ruling over blameless Palestinians, with no consideration for the nuances and details of the conflict. Israel’s <a href=""http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm"">Declaration of Independence guarantees equal rights to all citizens irrespective of religion, race, or sex. It is a country where a <a href=""http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/143899#.UTYaBOvwL0g"">Palestinian citizen of Israel serves as a Supreme Court Justice; where political discourse includes <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/news/israeli-elections-2013/ahmed-tibi-the-jews-are-bigger-tax-evaders-than-the-arabs.premium-1.492947"">Arab elected officials who are hyper-critical of Israel; and where <a href=""http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/academic-boycotter-study-tel-aviv"">all citizens are guaranteed the same right to education. It is a country committed to peaceful coexistence, not a country with a systematic policy of racism. By using the misnomer of “apartheid,” the PSC explicitly demonizes Israel by squeezing the complicated Arab-Israeli conflict into the same racially driven mold that existed in South Africa. We take issue with certain Israeli policies and recognize that the state is not perfect, but we base our criticism in historically accurate facts. It takes only a very rudimentary understanding of the situation to appreciate the PSC’s gross misuse of the word “apartheid.”The PSC as an organization consistently projects a dishonest voice that distorts the reality of the conflict. Last November, the group staged a “<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/21/students-protest-gaza-violence/"">die-in” to show solidarity with the Palestinian people of Gaza under what the PSC deemed a <a href=""http://www.harvardpsc.com/solidarity_die_in_with_gaza/"">so-called “unprovoked assault” from Israel. It is one thing to show solidarity with the people of Gaza, but labeling the operation as “unprovoked” is a deliberate neglect for the <a href=""http://www.idfblog.com/facts-figures/rocket-attacks-toward-israel/"">more than 10,000 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel over the previous decade. The PSC bases its activism in the <a href=""http://www.harvardpsc.com/veritas-handbook/"">Veritas Handbook, a 347-page “guide to understanding the struggle for Palestinian human rights.” Crimson columnist <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/column/the-rainbow-sign/article/2013/2/26/Harvard-PSC-BDS/"">Daniel Solomon described it last week as “glib dismissals of Arab and Muslim anti-Semitism...indulg[ing] in conspiracy theories, that Mossad agents, not government-sanctioned campaigns of violence and terror, were responsible for the exodus of Jews from Arab lands.” The PSC’s <a href=""http://www.harvardpsc.com/about/mission/"">mission statement states that it “does not prescribe a solution to the struggle; rather...believe[s] in supporting and amplifying the voices of those working against injustice.” If an organization is devoted to a struggle, that struggle should at least aim for a peaceful resolution built on mutual respect and understanding. Instead, the PSC polarizes the campus discourse through misinformation and inflammatory tactics.
We acknowledge the PSC’s efforts to bring attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict at Harvard. The PSC’s engagement, however, is a struggle based on publicity stunts and inaccurate buzz words— just as posting Morsi’s hateful statement with no explanation would have been—leaving no space for open discussion or reasoned debate. We call on the organization to delve into the intricacies of the reality of the Arab-Israeli conflict and to take on opposing narratives, especially when they challenge pre-existing understandings.Ariel Rubin ’13 is a special concentrations concentrator in Winthrop House. Ariella Rotenberg ’13 is a social studies concentrator in Lowell House.

After a regular season of breakouts and busts, comebacks and collapses, and departure and development, the Harvard men’s basketball team has finished on top.With a 65-56 win over Cornell Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson clinched its third consecutive Ivy title, and with some help from Brown—which beat Princeton, 80-67—Harvard is headed to the NCAA Tournament for the second straight season.The Crimson (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) entered the night needing a win to clinch a share of the championship, and a Tigers loss in one of its two final games—Saturday at Brown or Tuesday at Penn—to win the title outright.It got the help it needed on Saturday, when the Bears stunningly upset Princeton in Providence.“Just how we drew it up,” co-captain Christian Webster joked. “I’m just thankful. This is crazy.”
Of course, before Harvard could worry about the rest of the league, it had to take care of business on its home court against the Big Red (13-18, 5-9).And following a season of dramatic finishes, it was only fitting that the final contest came down to the wire.After trailing by 14 with nine minutes to go in the second half, Cornell cut the Harvard lead to five with 1:35 remaining. But Miles Asajo-Adjei missed a jumper that would have made it a one-possession game, and sophomore Wesley Saunders, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, and freshman Siyani Chambers knocked down six of eight free throws in the final moments to ice the championship and begin the celebration as the student section stormed the court.“What a victory of our kids, and what a weekend for our program,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I can’t say enough how proud I am of our guys.”The Crimson’s third championship was its most unexpected. After a season began with the departures of co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, the Crimson withstood its toughest non-conference schedule yet and maintained a lead through league play until last weekend, when a sweep by Princeton and Penn put Harvard a game back of the Tigers.“We were obviously very dejected and down after that two-loss weekend,” Amaker said. “[But] we said that we have it play this out and see how it shakes out.”It played out well for the Crimson, which took care of business at home this weekend, while the Tigers were shockingly swept to send the Crimson to the dance.“We never gave up, and anything can happen in this league,” Rivard said.On Saturday, Harvard went into the half up eight and stretched its lead to 13 when Chambers hit a long three from the top of the key. Errick Peck answered back with a layup for a Cornell, but Rivard—who led all scorers with 17 points—answered back with a left-wing long ball to push the advantage to 14.From there, Cornell began chipping away and got within seven with 4:28 remaining on an Asafo-Adjai layup and then within five on two Peck free throws.

The scene was set for a decisive fourth frame on Saturday afternoon at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium. After trading blows for three quarters, the Harvard men's lacrosse team entered the game’s final 15 minutes clinging to a 7-6 lead over Georgetown. And as it had done all game long, the Crimson defense held strong. Ten minutes passed with no scoring from either side, until junior attackman Peter Schwartz fired a shot from straight-on to give his team a two-goal cushion. The Hoyas (2-2) had no answer in the waning minutes and Harvard (2-2) walked off with the 8-6 victory.The Crimson got big performances from Shwartz, who tallied two goals, as well as junior midfielder Daniel Eipp, who added one goal to go along with three assists. But perhaps the strongest play on the afternoon came from senior goalkeeper Harry Krieger, who anchored a stifling defensive performance for Harvard with twice as many saves (12) as goals allowed (6).“The defense has been strong this year but it was exceptional today,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “Georgetown is an excellent team and our D was on…as was as our goaltender.”After scoring three unanswered goals in the second frame, Harvard found itself on the opposite end of the equation to begin the third quarter. A trio of Georgetown scores allowed the Hoyas to slice into the Crimson lead and eventually claim the advantage.The first of those goals came unassisted from Georgetown sophomore midfielder Charles McCormick at the 12:30 mark. Two minutes later, the Hoyas parlayed a save from goalkeeper Jake Haley into a break on the other end, with Riley O’Connor eventually finding himself alone in front of the net, where he beat Krieger to tie the game at four.
The Georgetown momentum continued as senior attackman Zac Guy took the lead for his squad just a minute later on a top-shelf shot from the left flank.But that momentum soon turned. Eipp found midfielder Ryan Stevens in front of the net, and the senior maneuvered through traffic and finished to bring Harvard level with 7:30 to play in the third frame. Eipp continued to make plays for the Crimson, scoring a goal of his own a minute later to give Harvard a one-goal advantage.“We had great efforts on both offense and defense today,” Eipp said. “It was a complete team effort.”Eipp earned his third assist of the game soon after, as he found freshman attackman Devin Dwyer streaking to the goal. Dwyer’s score gave the Crimson a two-goal lead with two minutes to play in the quarter, but that lead was cut to one just moments later by sophomore attackman Riley O’Connor, setting the stage for the deciding final frame.“I was really happy that our guys came to play and really wanted this game,” Wojcik said.The first half was a defensive battle, with the two sides combining for just six goals. The game opened with high energy but little scoring, despite the fact that each side had its early chances. It wasn’t until the six-minute mark that Hoyas senior attackman Brian Casey broke the stalemate with a man-up, unassisted goal—his eighth of the young season.But Harvard broke through soon after. Freshman attackman Sean McDonagh, beginning from the top of the box, streaked by his defender from left to right and fired a shot that found its way under the stick of Georgetown sophomore goalkeeper Jake Haley.The 1-1 tie would be short-lived, however. The Hoyas won the ensuing faceoff and Casey, finding himself behind the Crimson net, wrapped around and fired a shot past Krieger. Both defenses held strong for the remainder of the quarter.The second frame was all Harvard. One play after firing a shot over the Georgetown net, junior attackman Peter Schwartz took a pass from freshman attackman Devin Dwyer and bounced a shot into the back of the net, knotting the score at two with just under 13 minutes to play in the frame.The home squad tacked on another seconds later. Following a Georgetown turnover on the ensuing faceoff, the Crimson carried the ball through the midfield before senior midfielder Alex White found junior attackman Carl Zimmerman, who finished from close range to give Harvard its first lead of the afternoon.The two teams traded shots for the next few minutes, with neither breaking through until the waning seconds of the period, when Eipp faked out his defender at the top of the box, drew the defense towards him, and found captain Jason Gonos, who beat the goalkeeper from close range to send the Crimson into the half leading, 4-2.Harvard may have benefited from a little additional home-field advantage in the form of sub-40 degree temperatures throughout the game.“We were out here playing in the hail a few days ago,” Eipp said. “It definitely gives us some additional toughness on days like today.”—Staff writer James M.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!Lowell House is perhaps best known for its beauty. Few Houses rival the visual impact of the bell tower or the picturesque calm of the courtyard. But small, walk-through rooms and the incessant unskilled ringing of the House's infamous bells detract from Lowell's otherwise positive attributes.<span style=""font-size: 10px;""><!--more-->House Spirit: Lowellians are a close-knit bunch who take pride in their community. Stein Clubs and Lowell Teas are popular and well-attended. Lowell is not the most aggressively spirited of Harvard Houses—but between its proximity to the Yard, beautiful grounds, and an epic Housing Day <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbaNBSw1efw"">video, perhaps it doesn't need to be.Housing Quality: Lowell housing stock is perhaps the House's greatest drawback. While the architecture may appeal to fans of the classic Harvard aesthetic, rooms tend to be small. Many sophomores get to negotiate the joys of the walk-through double, and even upperclassmen tend to have living quarters tighter than those of friends in neighboring Houses. For many Lowellians, though, the location of the House makes up in spades for the size of the rooms. Why linger in a dorm room, after all, when Noch's, Felipe's, and Tasty Burger are just seconds away? This prime location comes with its own set of cons, however: noise from nearby final clubs—and, of course, the Lowell bells—is all too familiar.
 Dining Hall: With its pale yellow walls and grand chandeliers, the Lowell dining hall is Harvard neo-Georgian at its sunniest—inviting and elegant in equal parts. The food itself is neither exceptional nor particularly objectionable, and the servery is cramped. Lowell has the advantage of being close enough to the Yard for a quick weekday lunch, but draws smaller crowds than the perennially over-packed Adams. Facilities: Lowell students can study in the ""grill,"" which doesn't actually serve food, play squash in the House courts, get a workout in the dance studio, and even practice their climbing abilities at the Harvard Bouldering Wall. There are also many common spaces, including basement classrooms and the beautifully appointed JCR. House Masters: Professor Diana L. Eck and her wife Dorothy A. Austin, a lecturer on Psychology, are universally adored and often cited as the best thing about the House. Every Thursday, Eck and Austin open up the doors of their charming, ivy-covered residence for Lowell Teas. Students pack the ground floor, baking in the kitchen and talking in clusters in the living room. Teas are a reliable source of delicious treats and friendly conversation. Extra: Lowell, like every Harvard House, has its share of strange and wonderful traditions and secrets. In the winter months, dozens of Lowell residents give five-minute speeches on topics of personal importance to their peers and tutors in the dining hall. The Lowell House Opera sets up shop in the dining hall every spring, to the delight and/or annoyance of residents. The House is also known for its Russian bells, which ring out tunes like ""Call Me Maybe"" each Sunday, and Arts First weekend brings a ""pick-up"" performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture in the Lowell House Courtyard.Our rankings so far:7.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!This year, Pfoho relinquishes its crown as the highest ranked House in the Quad and descends to number 8 in Flyby's Rankings. But fear not, freshmen—those placed into Pfoho will have little to lament. Instead, they will celebrate spacious bedrooms, a magnificent lawn, well-equipped facilities, consistent shuttle service, and a vibrant House community.<!--more-->House Spirit: Pfoho residents rally around their two-letter cry to arms, ""p-f."" Some might say that adding a ""p"" before every word that begins with an ""f"" is excessive; to those critics, Pfoho says ""pforget you."" Pfoho students love their House and will defend it pfiercely to anyone who rags on the Quad. In the days leading up to Housing Day, students and House Master Nicholas A. Christakis <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/image/2012/3/8/housing-day-pfoho-polar-bear/"">wear head-to-tail polar bear costumes around campus as a public demonstration of their pf-love. Pfoho is also known across campus for its Housing Day videos that are clever takes on Internet memes. Take one, the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuydL61SnTs"">Harlem Shake. Take two, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I04_OQbN5g"">Sh*t River People Say. Take three, this controversial <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViEcI5FC5pc"">Hitler parody from 2010, which remains a perennial favorite on campus. No one can say that Pfoho is not culturally relevant. With its determination to put its signature ""p"" in front of every pfreaking pfhrase, Pforzheimer proudly takes its place among the most spirited Houses on campus. Housing Quality: Bunk beds are foreign to Pfoho students. Sophomores rarely receive doubles, meaning that most polar bears are guaranteed singles for all three years. Juniors and seniors most often reside either in top floor duplexes in one of the three ""bricks""— Holmes, Comstock, and Moors—or in the highly-prized Wolbach suites with hardwood floors and gargantuan common rooms. Pfoho common rooms create a desirable space for socializing, unlike those in the river Houses that are usually small and cluttered with desks. Jordan is another housing option. The Quad of the Quad, it's annexed from the rest of the House but boasts kitchens, accesable facilities, guaranteed singles, and floor-length windows. Jordan is a favorite of athletes and students who cherish its proximity to Northwest Labs and the Law School.
 Dining Hall: No other House boasts a two-tier dining hall. Pfoho's modern architecture features floor-to-ceiling windows that stream in sunlight at all hours of the day. Needless to say, ""natural lighting"" is a pfashionable pfhrase around the House. While some decry Pfoho's distance from the Yard, others do not think of it as a bother. The self-proclaimed ""Pfoho lunch club"" travels back to the Quad every day to eat in between classes. As for food, Pfoho's chef was formerly employed by the Four Seasons, so its dining hall offers a tasty array of meals. Pfoho's dining hall is also centrally located within the House. While students in river Houses must cross courtyards to eat, Pfoho students do not have to step outside. With the exception of Jordan, Pfoho is contiguously connected by breezeways. As former House Master Woody Hastings is rumored to have remarked, any student ought to be able to travel between locations in the House ""in his PJs or less.""  Facilities: Anything you want, Pfoho's got it. Pfhoto lab? Check. Pfilm room where you can check out DVDs? Check. Pf-recording studio in the basement? Check. Pfoho has a recently furnished Junior Common Room with dartboards, a pool table, a widescreen TV, and a distinctly modern vibe. Pfoho is also home to the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/12/8/room-woodward-people-happy/"">Happy Room, a faux-seaside escape complete with patio chairs, tropical lighting, and trees (painted on the walls). While some cherish the room, others question whether it is overcompensation; as one tongue-in-cheek resident commented, ""Pfoho has a Happy Room because it needs it.""  House Masters: Wild card. Pfoho's charming House Masters, Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis '86, will transfer from Pfoho next year not to a river House but all the way to New Haven (gross) and Yale University (for shame). With new masters at the helm of the House next year, the mood and tone of Pforzhemier is yet to be determined.

Playing in relatively warm Myrtle Beach, S.C., the Harvard baseball team could never get the bats to heat up.In its first two games of the weekend, the Crimson (1-6) failed to put any runs on the board, falling first to Ohio State, 11-0, and the next day, 10-0, to Coastal Carolina.Harvard scratched across its first runs of the weekend on Sunday, but it was not enough to overcome Ball State as the Crimson went on to suffer another defeat, 10-2.“Our main problem was executing when it really mattered,” sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel said. “We hit the ball pretty fine, but we just never really put it all together at one time. A lot of people showed a lot of good things.”BALL STATE 10, HARVARD 2
With the score 5-2 in favor of the Cardinals (6-8) after the sixth inning, the Crimson still found itself in the game. But Ball State took advantage of a series of hits to open the game up in the top of the seventh, scoring five runs with two outs left in the inning.“It was a pretty close game up until [the seventh inning],” Kregel said. “Right there and then they were able to come together, string everything together, and execute when it mattered. And I think that’s what broke the game open.”Harvard tied the game at one in its half of the second. After a walk and a single, freshman shortstop Mitch Klug singled up the middle to plate Kregel.The Crimson scored its second and final run of the weekend in the fifth, when junior infielder Carlton Bailey made his way to third base after a throwing error and was singled home by Kregel a batter later.“We’re definitely putting the ball in play, which is different than last year when we were striking out a lot more,” sophomore outfielder Mike Martin said. “We’re hitting the ball and they’re just going right to fielders, especially when we’re hitting them hard. We just need a couple breaks.”For the third game in a row, Harvard pitchers had trouble retiring their opposition. Ball State hit junior pitcher Baron Davis the hardest, as he allowed seven earned runs in fewer than four innings.COASTAL CAROLINA 10, HARVARD 0The Crimson fell into an early hole against the Chanticleers (6-8) on Saturday afternoon, giving up four runs in the bottom of the first inning. Despite the cushion, Coastal Carolina continued to build its lead throughout the game, taking advantage of another four run inning to roll to a 10-0 victory.Although the Harvard offense posted seven hits—and had a man on third base five different times—the team could not come through with runners in scoring position and was shut out for the third time this year.“We have to be more aggressive on the basepaths,” Martin said. “We need to push the envelope a little bit more and maybe get some more hitting and running, bunting, and getting guys over when we need to.”

With 21 seconds on the clock on Saturday night, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers closed the door on his first Ivy League season, clinching his first conference title and NCAA tournament berth.After being fouled by Cornell guard Nolan Cressler, Chambers went to the line to shoot two—missing the first and making the second—and ensuring the Harvard men’s basketball team a 65-56 win over the Big Red (13-18, 5-9 Ivy) at Lavietes Pavilion in its final regular season game.Forty-five minutes later, the Crimson (19-9, 11-3) learned that rival Princeton had fallen to Brown, handing the Crimson its second consecutive outright title.Emerging amidst uncertainty and doubt after the withdrawals of Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry at the beginning of the season, Chambers burst onto the scene with nine points in 36 minutes in the season opener against MIT. The freshman quickly solidified his spot in the lineup from the get-go, starting all 28 games and averaging 37.8 minutes per game.But entering Ivy League play—where teams face each other twice and scouting and matchups become more critical—Chambers struggled at times to maintain his efficiency and was held to five points both times out against Penn.
“It was a compliment to him when people game-planned against him,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I told him that against Penn because their game plan was to take them out of the game.”Chambers started the season as one of the hottest three-point shooters on the team, most notably going five for five from beyond the arc against St. Mary’s on Dec. 31, but in his last eight games, the freshman went four for 17 from deep.But on Saturday Chambers turned it around. He put up 16 points for the second night in a row in an efficient and diverse offensive showing, going six for nine from the field and three for four from deep.After missing his first three-point shot just over 30 seconds into the game, Chambers sunk one to open the second half and wouldn’t miss again, knocking down two more in the next eight minutes.“I’ve never worried about his confidence,” Amaker said. “He’s going to have some tough stretches or games, but he knows how much we believe in him.”DON’T STOP BELIEVIN’Coming into the season with so many question marks, few would have predicted that the Crimson would finish the season in such fashion.Princeton was picked to take the conference by a near unanimous vote in the preseason poll, finishing with 13 first-place votes points to Harvard’s two behind established big-name player Ian Hummer.But Amaker had a different idea.The Crimson emerged from non-conference play with a winning record, playing stretches of competitive basketball against top teams like Memphis and Connecticut. Despite a few games that were too close comfort against Ancient Eight opponents, Harvard came out on top after splitting the series with Princeton and remaining undefeated at home.

Looking to earn a spot in the ECAC quarterfinals for the fourth straight season, the Harvard men’s hockey team (10-19-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) suffered a 4-1 loss to Dartmouth Saturday night at Thompson Arena.With the win, the Big Green (15-12-5, 9-9-4 ECAC) tied the series at one, forcing a winner-take-all matchup Sunday night in the best-of-three first round series.Having fallen to the Crimson the night before, Dartmouth had its back against the wall, not wanting to see its season—in which it had once been ranked in the top 10 nationally—end in an upset sweep to a last place Harvard squad.“They definitely played harder,” junior goalie Raphael Girard said. “I’d say they were physically a little softer on Friday and they definitely put more traffic in front of net yesterday which allowed them to create a little havoc in front of our net and eventually score some screen goals.”The Crimson was able to stave off the Big Green attack for half of the game, keeping the contest close, tied at one midway through the second period.
But Dartmouth scored three unanswered goals thereafter, with sophomore forward Tyler Sikura netting a power-play goal 12:48 in the second and the Big Green piling on two more goals in the third to clinch the 4-1 victory.Assistant captain Alex Fallstrom had the lone tally for Harvard, a power-play goal 8:43 in the second from a tough angle near the left side of the Dartmouth net. Girard recorded 31 saves in the loss.Dartmouth came out roaring in the first, dominating puck possession and outshooting the Crimson 15-5. But just one of those 15 shots hit the back of the Harvard net, with Dustin Walsh scoring halfway through the first with help from Sikura and freshman forward Tim O’Brien.With its season on the line, and with the Crimson appearing more motivated after coming into Hanover as the underdogs and winning game one, the Big Green brought its best play to Harvard in game two and took control early.“Going into Saturday night I don’t think we really grasped fully the intensity Dartmouth would bring out in the first period when their backs were against the wall facing elimination,” junior defenseman John Caldwell said. “So I think we got caught a little flat-footed in the first period on Saturday night.”Fallstrom tied it up at one before Sikura scored what would be the eventual game-winner.Senior Luke Greiner stole the puck back from the home team as they attempted to clear the Crimson attack. He immediately passed the puck back to captain Danny Biega near the right point with a backhanded pass, and then Biega sent a sharp pass through two Dartmouth defensemen to Fallstrom by the left baseline. The Swede shot the puck over Morris’ shoulder and into the top right corner of the goal.In the third, the Big Green put the game out of reach. Senior defenseman Mike Keenan scored on a shot through traffic, beating Girard on his stick side and putting Dartmouth up 3-1. Freshman forward Brett Patterson and junior forward Lindblad were attributed with the assists.Lindblad capped the scoring for the Big Green, taking advantage of a breakaway after senior Brendan Rempel tripped over a broken stick left on the visitors’ blue line.Despite the four goals, Harvard believed it would be able to limit the Big Green’s attack on Sunday and make the appropriate adjustments.“I’d say the goals we gave up [Saturday] are easily fixable [Sunday] so I think the team is pretty confident,” Girard said.The Crimson looked to put this game behind it as it prepared for its third game in three days Sunday evening, where the Crimson’s season ultimately came to an end, as Harvard lost, 4-1.“If you show with your own intensity it doesn’t really matter what anyone else brings to the table…. We’ll be ready from the drop of the puck until the end of the game,” Caldwell said. “We’re going to get it deep, we’re going to hit them hard, we are going to get pucks to the net, we are going to crash, we’re going to get ugly goals. We are not looking for end-to-end goals, we are looking to pound it in there, hurt them, and get some goals in the dirty areas.”—Staff writer David A. Mazza can be reached at damazza@college.harvard.edu.

With an undefeated dual meet season in the books, the No. 18 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) entered this weekend pursuing one last goal for the season: an Ivy League title.“We went in with the attitude that it would be a challenge,” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “We viewed ourselves as underdogs.”After three days of competition, the Crimson eventually fell short of its goal, losing the Ivy League Championships by a mere 68 points to Princeton.With a 1,514 point total, the Tigers just barely edged out Harvard to claim their fifth-straight Ivy League title.“Across the board, everyone performed to the level they were capable of performing,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “We did the best we could. Obviously, we came up short of our goal. But ultimately, the score was out of our control. No one has a reason to hang their head about their performance this weekend.”
It was a close contest all weekend. The Crimson picked up a win in the first event of the meet, taking the 200 meter free relay in record-setting fashion. Griffin Schumacher, Danny Crigler, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite posted an NCAA ‘A’ cut time of 1:18.06, good-enough for a school record and a berth to the NCAA Championships.That evening, sophomore Michael Mosca picked up his second straight Ivy title in the one-meter dive, setting a pool record with a 387.05 point total. He later went on to the three-meter event and was named Karl B. Michael High Point Diver of the Meet.After Thursday’s competition, Harvard held a slim 467-423 lead. But Princeton came storming back in the second day of competition, opening Friday with a win in the 200 medley relay.But the Crimson kept the points race close. Satterthwaite won the 200 free with an NCAA ‘B’ time of 1:35.00. Sophomore Chuck Katis, who has led Harvard with strong performances all year, earned his first Ivy title with a win in the 100 breast in a pool-record time of 53.90. But even with the victories, the Tigers overtook the Crimson and held a 972-949 advantage into the final day of competition.“We expected to be down a little bit more than we were,” Roop said. “We knew if we were within 40 points of Princeton, then we had a chance of winning the meet. Everyone was pumped up about the preliminary heats that morning because that was ultimately where we were either going to win or lose the meet. We had a lot of people step up and swim really fast, but Princeton, to their credit, swam lights out.”Satterthwaite helped lead Harvard’s charge, picking up a win in the 100 free with a time of 43.28.“[He] was lights out every time he got on the blocks,” Wurzbacher said. “That was incredible, and we needed that from him.”The Crimson swept the podium in the event, with Oliver Lee claiming second and Griffin Schumacher rounding out the top three. But despite the strong efforts, Harvard saw its chances of overtaking the four-time reigning champion slip as the day progressed.“Our team swam absolutely lights out,” Wurzbacher said. “They did absolutely everything we could’ve asked them and more. Princeton was just better this weekend. That was something we were okay with because we knew we gave it everything we had.”But in the final event of the meet, even with Princeton’s victory sealed, the Crimson had one of its most impressive swims with a record-breaking win in the 400 free relay. Satterthwaite swam the opening leg in 42.99, the first Harvard swimmer to ever break the 43-second mark in the leadoff position. Schumacher, sophomore Zach Walters, and Lee followed in a similar fashion to finish in an NCAA ‘A’ time of 2:52.32, good for both school and pool records.“Chris went off in a time that would’ve sent him to NCAA’s automatically,” Wurzbacher said. “And then each guy stepped up in that relay in a way none of them had ever before to make sure we won. Princeton swam out of their minds in that 400 freestyle relay. Everything each of our guys did was necessary to win that race.”In total, the Crimson picked up eight victories on the weekend while setting six school records and posting 28 NCAA ‘A’ or ‘B’ cut times.“It really was the best meet we could’ve swam,” Roop said. “We had some really amazing performances. You just can’t help but feel really good about the direction this team is headed in, even though we didn’t end up winning.”—Staff writer Brenna R.

When the clock struck 0 on Saturday night in Ithaca, N.Y., the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself in sole possession of second place in the Ivy League.As a result of a 66-56 victory at Cornell (13-15, 5-9 Ivy) and Penn’s loss to Yale, the Crimson was guaranteed a conference record at least equal to the Quakers and thus assured a bid to the WNIT tournament.Harvard (19-8, 10-3 Ivy) was led by a strong inside performance from sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle who earned her second straight double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. Fagbenle displayed solid offensive efficiency, finishing 7-for-10 from the field and grabbing three offensive boards.“[Fagbenle] was really big down the stretch defensively,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “When Cornell was staging a comeback, I thought [she] turned it on and did a great job.”That small comeback came in the last five minutes, as the Big Red tried to reduce a 13-point deficit, coming within seven.
It was too little too late, however, as the Crimson refused to lose the lead that it had held since a 6-0 start. Harvard jumped out of the gate quickly and never looked back on their way to a 31-17 halftime lead.Fagbenle’s performance helped the Crimson exert an inside presence, as the team out-rebounded Cornell by a margin of 44-31 and shot 21-for-39 from within the arc.“We’ve almost out-rebounded everyone we’ve played all year, so that’s an expectation that we have,” Delaney-Smith said. “When [Cornell] was staging their comeback, they went hard to the offensive boards, but we ended up making an adjustment and ended up with the edge.”Harvard had 16 turnovers in the game, which was fewer their season average of 17.6 but more than Cornell’s eight.“I think we still have a lot to do when it comes to teamwork,” Fagbenle said. “We know we can do better…. [We can still] improve our execution.”Junior guard Christine Clark led all scorers with 22 points, tying her high since November, and added six rebounds as well. Many of her points came from the free throw line, where she went 10-for-11.“[Clark] did a lot of the dirty work,” Delaney-Smith said. “She didn’t force it. She just let it come to her.”Four of Clark’s points ended a Cornell run with two minutes remaining, as the guard scored back-to-back layups to push Harvard’s lead back up to 11.Saturday’s game was Senior Night for the Big Red, which will lose four of the team’s top players to graduation. Seniors Taylor Flynn, Clare Fitzpatrick, Spencer Lane, and Kristina Danielak scored 39 of Cornell’s 56 points in their final game in a red uniform.Flynn paced Cornell with a team-high 21 points. In the last minute, the senior made back-to-back threes to cut the lead down to eight with 41 seconds left.

The Harvard women’s basketball team edged another step closer to the WNIT on Friday night, taking down Columbia at Levien Gym.The 61-44 win was the fifth straight for the Crimson (19-8, 10-3 Ivy), which hasn’t dropped a game on its New York road trip since 2008 and has won seven consecutive games against the Lions.“I thought we really took it upon ourselves to come out, not worrying about who we were playing or what was on the line, and just play our basketball,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “We did a really good job of doing that.”Lions senior forward Tyler Simpson put up 19 points but was unable to stop the Harvard squad, which outrebounded Columbia (4-22, 2-10) 46 to 31. The rebound total was the Crimson’s highest since the team brought down 50 rebounds in a win against Yale on Feb. 1. Simpson was the only player from her team to register more than eight points.“Believe it or not, I was not unhappy with our defense,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “[Simpson is] just a worker, so she got a lot of behind the scenes jobs. I would say for the most part, until the end of the game, I was pretty happy with shutting her down well enough.”
Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle nabbed her sixth double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds.“I thought she had a great weekend,” Delaney-Smith said. “Everybody keys in on her, and she wasn’t used to that coming out of the Olympics. The heat gets turned up on the double-teams and triple-teams in conference play…. We’ve had to find creative ways to get her the ball.”Senior Victoria Lippert paced the team with 15 points. The guard totaled 53 points during a four-game homestand in which Harvard took down ivy foes Brown, Yale, Penn, and Princeton.“She has played like a senior,” Delaney-Smith said. “She has played like a champion. She wants the ball in her hands when the game is on the line.”The Crimson also saw offensive action from the bench, as five players combined to contribute 20 points.“As the Ivy League season has been going along, a lot of people coming off the bench have contributed in many ways,” Curtis said. “I think having people come off the bench who are really able to play their role and contribute defensively and offensively has been key to our success.”Harvard shooters found their stride early on in the contest. A jumper from Lippert gave the Crimson a 5-3 edge after two and a half minutes of play. From there, Harvard never released its grip on the lead.The first half saw the Crimson hold the Lions to just 25 percent shooting from the field. Simpson shot 3-for-10 while only two of her teammates, guards Taylor Ward and Miwa Tachibana, made any field goals.Harvard denied Columbia many second looks, with Fagbenle claiming five of her team’s 17 defensive boards through the frame.The team finished the period on a high, with a layup from junior guard Christine Clark and a bucket from Fagbenle stretching the Crimson’s lead to 11, 30-19. Clark, who went 12-for-12 at the charity stripe at Columbia last year, was held to just five points through her 36 minutes of play.

With the Harvard men’s basketball team (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) down two to Columbia (12-16, 4-10) with 35 seconds to go, sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi ripped a rebound out of the air, quickly passing the ball to freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers surveyed the court and took off down towards the Columbia basket.“[Harvard coach Tommy Amaker] said that, if they missed, he wanted me to come down and try to get something early,” Chambers said. “When Steve came down with the rebound, he gave it to me, and I saw a crease and went for it.”Shooting past a defender, Chambers followed Amaker’s call to the letter. Absorbing contact, the freshman laid the ball up off the backboard as the referee blew a whistle. Tie game. After the ensuing Chambers free throw, Moundou-Missi picked off a pass and his fast break dunk put the Crimson up three.Three more free throws, one by Moundou-Missi and a pair by sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith, gave Harvard a six-point advantage it would not give back in a 56-51 victory. As the timeout bell blared, the arena’s PA announcer came on with another piece of Crimson good fortune: Yale had just defeated Princeton, 71-66, for the second time this season, putting Harvard back in first place in the Ivy League standings.LOCKED AND CHAMBERED
After finishing with only five points last Saturday in a 75-72 loss to Penn, Chambers rebounded with his most efficient game of the season on Friday. The rookie tallied 16 points on five-of-six shooting from the field and six of seven from the line, adding two steals and three assists to round out the night.Amaker said the freshman’s play on the offensive end helped bail out a struggling Crimson squad—co-captains junior Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster combined to shoot three for 13 from the floor. On the other side of the court, Chambers was tasked with containing senior Lions guard Brian Barbour, who ended the game with 11 points.“Siyani’s play overall was amazing,” Amaker said. “I thought he was daring and fearless in addition to having to guard one of the better guards in our league. He did a nice job of guarding him and not fouling him. Barbour is good at drawing contact and Siyani’s discipline on defense was really big for us.”REBOUNDING ISSUES PERSISTAfter giving up 13 offensive rebounds and being outrebounded by 13 overall the weekend before against Princeton, Harvard came out and was once again soundly beaten on the boards. Despite starting a much smaller lineup than Princeton, Columbia finished the game with 14  offensive rebounds, 11 of which came in the second half.To combat this, Amaker went to a two-big lineup early in the first half and used it for a solid portion of the game. According to Amaker, playing both Smith and Moundou-Missi, who combined for 16 of the team’s 26 rebounds, was crucial to the victory.“I think that one of the things is that we need Steve on the floor,” Amaker said. “[Smith] gives us a different presence in blocking shots but we wanted to go bigger with two traditional post guys. We didn’t always rebound the ball well with that lineup [today], but it gives us our best chance to rebound.”Amaker said that the team’s focus on shutting down Lions guard Steve Frankowski—who scored 27 points in the two teams’ first meeting but was kept off the board on Friday—opened up rebounding lanes for the Lions.“We certainly didn’t want to leave him and give him open looks,” Amaker said. “Sometimes when you fixate, you open up the floor for other guys and that’s what they exploited. That space left them with offensive rebounds that they grabbed.”A FINAL STANDOn his Senior Night, Webster was the sole Crimson player honored before the game. Webster has been the most successful player in Harvard history with 89 wins and now needs only 3 points to get to 1000 for his career. Amaker said that Webster has stepped up this season in his new role as co-captain and the sole senior on the team.“I love Christian,” Amaker said. “He’s been an amazing addition to this program. I knew he would be and we were thrilled when he decided to come to Harvard. He has had a terrific career and I can’t say enough about he kind of person he is and the crucial and clutch plays that he has made throughout his career. There is no question that he has brought a lot to Harvard and to Harvard basketball.”—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!The phrase, ""I can see the SOCH from my House!"" is not generally considered a good thing among Harvard undergraduates. Throughout the (distinguished) history of Flyby House Rankings, Cabot House has been nowhere near the top five. In fact, the House has typically ranked in the bottom two. So what's changed? Not much, as it turns out. After our careful research, it comes down to this—Cabot has simply been underrated. Yes, it's in the Quad. But Cabot's large singles, abundant facilities, beloved House Masters, and overall pleasant atmosphere make it one of the more appealing Houses on campus.<!--more--> 
House Spirit: Everyone in Cabot loves Cabot. Described as ""homey"" and ""community driven,"" life in Cabot is friendly and fun. Every Sunday, the House runs ""Cabot Sharing"" in the dining hall, where students and tutors alike can pick up the open microphone to share anything important to them—be it their research, an emotional story, or even a joke. On the weekends, one can always find a friend in the dining hall during the day and a raging party at night. Housing Quality: Although (and probably because) it is far from the Yard and the Square, Cabot's rooms are spacious and comfortable. Most sophomores have singles, and large common rooms looking out over the Quad are the norm. Four of the six buildings are connected to each other and the dining hall by underground tunnels, meaning that most of Cabot residents don't have to step outside to get Sunday brunch. Being in the Quad has its perks as well—Cabot residents never have to worry about neighborhood noise (although noise can sometimes carry from room to room). Dining Hall: Cabot dining hall is small but pleasant. Looking out over the Quad, it functions a central hub at all hours of the day and night. The dining hall is very modern—it lacks the ""old Harvard"" feel prevalent in the rest of the House—and sometimes overcrowded due to its size, but students love the friendly dining hall staff and the cozy atmosphere. Facilities: Cabot seems to have everything. From the newly renovated gym to the theater to the abundance of pianos (the most, we think, of any House), it is easy to enjoy Cabot's benefits. Cabot is also home to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/5/19/quad-bike-shop-opens-a-city/"">Quad Bikes and <a href=""http://cabotcafe.com/"">Cabot Café, where students can get a snack until 1 a.m. on weeknights. House Masters: Rakesh and Stephanie Khurana are the catalysts for Cabot's strong House life. They can be found eating in the dining hall regularly, and they frequently lend their support to student-driven projects such as the creation of the roughly 600-square-foot <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/12/8/quad-arts-festival-accessible/"">Cabot Art Space (due to open this spring). Students describe them as one of the best parts of Cabot House.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!Built in 1914 as freshman dormitories, Standish and Gore Halls were later united to form Winthrop House. In the years since its inception, Winthrop has certainly accumulated its fair share of famous alums, from J. Robert Oppenheimer '26 to Barnett ""Barney"" Frank '61-'62, and plenty of Kennedys to boot. Situated less than five minutes from the Yard and directly facing the Charles River, Winthrop is one of the best-located Houses, and residents are pretty much guaranteed an incredible view from their bedrooms at least one year of their three-year stay. Though the rooms themselves may not be the best, Winthrop's architecture is, at the very least, nice to look at from the outside.<!--more-->House Spirit: Winthrop's IM domination in recent years suggests a pretty tightly knit House community. The Lions have won the Straus Cup for the past five years running, and are going for their sixth. And they're not kidding around, as evidenced by the recent creation of a Winthrop IMs <a href=""https://twitter.com/WinthropHouseIM"">Twitter account to keep people up to date on upcoming competitions and past results. For the less athletically inclined, Winthrop's House spirit isn't the strongest on campus, but the HoCo always encourages residents to come along to their weekly meetings in the JCR. Winthrop's annual spring carnival, ""Thropstock,"" brings Winthrop students together with blow-up rides, a picnic, and live music to enjoy.Housing Quality: Winthrop has a notoriously bad reputation for its housing, which, for sophomore and even junior suites, is well deserved. Not only does Winthrop lack n+1 housing, the bedrooms in n suites tend to be on the smaller side, forcing many students to relive the dreaded bunk bed days of freshman year. Some residents also complain about thin walls, but hey, you'll definitely know your neighbors well by the end of the year… and maybe someone's boyfriend or girlfriend, too. Once you finally reach the hallowed days of the senior suite, Winthrop's housing really isn't so bad, and they have some pretty great rooms that boast balconies with river views.
Dining Hall: Though the words ""dark and dungeon-like"" have been thrown around to describe Winthrop's dining hall, we tend to think of the Slytherin-like dark walls and monochrome floors as part of the House's charm. Winthrop's dining hall is one of the quieter culinary locales on the river, which means you're more likely to bump into and be able to socialize with other Winthropians, and won't have to scream to have a conversation with your friends over dinner. While some complain that the servery is laid out counter-intuitively, everyone raves about Winthrop's friendly HUDS staff.Facilities: Winthrop boasts a beautiful library that is home to some very valuable art. When residents want to take a break from studying to relax, the courtyards have a tire swing, a hammock, and outdoor seating that make spending sunny days at the House a pleasure. Though there aren't a ton of common spaces indoors for when the weather gets colder, students can take advantage of both the Junior Common Room and the Senior Common Room, both of which fit in with Winthrop's classically-Harvard vibe.House Masters: House Masters Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson, though not quite as hands-on as other House's masters, are approachable and relate well to college students. Residents say they don't spend much time in the dining hall themselves, but their adorable sons Trey and Chase can often be seen running around during meal times. And Masters' Desserts, which<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> were previously catered by now former-Masters' Aide and Cordon Bleu-trained chef, Paulo Cesar Guede,<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> have a reputation for being delicious.Extra: Winthrop boasts some pretty unique and exciting events, from an annual game of assassins to the brand new Perini-Woods Memorial Senior Common Room Series, which allows students to listen to talks from notable guests. (Last year's inaugural Perini-Woods address came from <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/6/joseph-kennedy-winthrop-speech/"">Joseph P. Kennedy III.) Residents who live in F-entryway get to spend Presidents' Day evening having a celebration in JFK's old suite, which for the rest of the year is lent to some of Harvard's most distinguished guests. Kennedys aside, Winthrop offers some great class-specific events, including Mini Golf in Gore Courtyard for juniors and wine tastings, a masquerade ball, and Casino Night for seniors.Our rankings so far:6.

UPDATED: March 12, 2013, at 3:02 a.m.For the first time since news broke on Saturday that Harvard administrators had <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/9/cheating-leak-email-search/"">secretly searched the emails of 16 resident deans, top University officials offered an explanation of how and why they accessed the deans’ accounts. The <a href="" http://www.fas.harvard.edu/home/content/deans-communications"">statement, co-signed by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, left unanswered questions about whether the Harvard administration broke its own policy by accessing email accounts without notifying their owners.After the statement’s release Monday morning, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to provide further comment on the statement. Neal would not address whether or not the email accounts of resident deans—who are not technically faculty but enjoy some faculty privileges—are subject to the privacy policy of faculty or that of staff.Some have suggested that Harvard’s culpability in the incident hinges on this question. The <a href=""http://www.security.harvard.edu/files/Security_-_Faculty%2520Privacy%2520Advisory%25205.13.10.doc+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShJlNAJYhCt8gEyqxRoLhVCkWs7jwvrpID5dZ5ASGriyNsJuq7wPDiJ6IEAFgXLZb2MP9wjkuzrTO-KyCl6Kpb4b5GlDvWOW2uW6GwxoBtmVZB5_jcnRkkYy0EaV2FqW7Vykp9o&amp;sig=AHIEtbQdz4AABsKpX-GaHDTuSZVlzwsAqA"">FAS email policy protects professors from unannounced searches of their accounts. If faculty rules govern administrative access to resident deans’ email accounts, Harvard would have broken its policy by failing to notify the resident deans in advance of the search.The staff policy, however, authorizes Harvard officials to access a staff member’s emails and other electronic files “at any time” and “for any business purpose” without asking the employee. If those rules apply for resident deans, Harvard would not have deviated from its policy.
History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 said the statement also did not answer questions about what level of privacy faculty and others can expect from administrators.“While the statement gave specific answers to specific questions, the fact that email accounts held by figures on the Harvard campus—who teach in the classroom and have close relationships with students—were secretly probed in this way, raises concerns for all of us about the limits around our privacy,” Jasanoff said.Monday’s statement said that Smith and the University’s General Counsel approved the search last fall with the support of Hammonds in an attempt to track a leak of information regarding the Government 1310 cheating case.Administrators became aware of the leak when a <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/11/email-leak-text-ellison/"">confidential email, originally sent to resident deans advising them on how to counsel students implicated in the cheating investigation, was obtained by The Crimson after the cheating scandal broke.“The disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information—especially student information that we have a duty to protect as private—was at risk,” the statement said.Smith and Hammonds wrote that they first attempted to identify the source of the leak in interviews and committee meetings before the email search occurred.After a second piece of information—the details of a tiered <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/11/cheating-students-judged-individually/"">punishment scheme allegedly devised by administrators for the cheating cases—was leaked to The Crimson and other media outlets a week later, administrators redoubled their efforts to trace the leak. After the continuing investigation proved unfruitful, they decided on “a very narrow, careful, and precise subject-line search” of the resident deans’ email accounts.The search was conducted by Harvard University Information Technology and ultimately located the email with the subject line in question, identifying the resident dean who sent it. After speaking with that dean, administrators came to the conclusion that the leak was inadvertent and no action was taken, according to the statement. The other resident deans remained uninformed about the searches until late last week, when the Boston Globe approached the University in advance of an <a href=""http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/03/09/harvard-university-administrators-secretly-searched-deans-email-accounts-hunting-for-media-leak/d5lYY8vXLyZQYWtTNGxWkL/story.html"">article published Saturday evening.Administrators have <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/11/faculty-reaction-searches/"">come under fire from faculty members, many of whom believe the University overstepped its bounds in searching the deans’ accounts without prior notification—regardless of whether or not such action violated University policy. While professors said that Monday’s statement may have alleviated some concerns, they still feel that trust between the University and its faculty has been strained.“I think the issue I’m concerned about is that people in a university should not be trolling emails,” said history professor Charles S. Maier ’60. “Even just the subject line—it’s considered a kind of searching procedure that we didn’t think we worried about at this university.”

Before just about every social event I went to while I was growing up, from scholarship receptions to weddings, my mom would tell me to stop thinking about the way I looked and acted, and instead pay attention to other people. While in this case my mom was saying that I wouldn’t worry about my skirt being wrinkled or having something in my teeth if I was truly focused on what other people were saying, I think she was really sharing a greater point. When you start worrying about other people, you stop worrying so much about yourself.In light of the Crimson article “<a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/6/Harvard-friendship-priorities/"">Bring Back Banter” that was published last weekend and several other recent pieces about student life and student happiness, perhaps the Harvard student body could use some of my mom’s advice as well. Are we so caught up in our own lives that we’ve forgotten how to be interested in the lives of others?Before I came to Harvard, I considered myself pretty good at remembering other people’s names. Now I have trouble remembering the names of those I’ve met multiple times. In high school, I made a point to always buy my good friends a birthday present and my more casual friends at least a card. This year I almost forgot my own roommate’s birthday. Before Harvard, I always asked my friends how their game, performance, or show went on the rare occasion I couldn’t actually be there. Now I can hardly remember when my own games are. And that’s the problem. Our own lives are so overwhelming, so busy, so hectic, so scheduled, and so ostensibly important that it seems nearly impossible to fit in the lives of anyone else. However, in making that decision, we not only alienate ourselves from our peers, but we also only have ourselves to worry about.Now, I’m not saying anyone here needs more worry. I think most of us have more than enough of a burden on our shoulders. What I am saying is that we lose an important part of our own lives when we forget about others’ lives.  Last week, I ran into a casual friend in the dining hall and happened to remember that he was in Math 21a, which just had an exam. When I asked him how the exam went, a look of shock crossed his face. He then broke into a smile as he said, “I can’t believe you remembered that I had an exam.  It went well! Thank you so much for asking me about it!” His response made me wonder if anyone else had remembered that he had an exam. Had his roommates and friends, like so many of us, been so lost in a world of their own that they hadn’t cared about his midterm? At the same time, his response made me smile. In the midst of my pre-midterm stress and never-ending problem sets, it was nice to know that someone’s life was going well. Like my mom always preached, when we concern ourselves with others, our own worries seem so much smaller.Yes, Harvard is missing banter. Yes, Harvard is missing a healthy emotional culture. But perhaps more so, Harvard is missing compassion and interest in other people. Ironically, by losing interest in others, we also lose the joy and satisfaction that other people’s experiences can bring to our lives. I’m not saying that you need to sit down with each person in your section for 30 minutes each to learn about their lives, but maybe remember the name of the person who sits next to you and ask “George” how his week is going next time you go to class. I’m not saying you need to have front row seats for every one of your roommate’s shows, but at least take 30 seconds to send him or her a “break a leg” text. Maybe you could even go crazy and include a GIF.
Harvard student life is messy and Harvard student happiness is complex, but maybe the solution to our happiness here lies in making our own lives a little bit messier. Life here does not preclude us from being decent human beings to each other. Neither the possibility of having spinach in our teeth nor the difficulty of number seven on our problem set should excuse us from caring about the people who surround us. By way of our interest in each other, the wrinkles in our skirt become unimportant and we find our own happiness. I guess Mom does always know best.Tessa A.C.

UPDATED: April 8, 2013, at 4:25 a.m.Below is the text of an Aug. 16 email that was sent by Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison to his colleagues, including the 16 resident deans. In the email, Ellison offered guidance on how to advise athletes and other students implicated in the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/8/30/academic-dishonesty-ad-board/"">Government 1310 cheating scandal. After obtaining the email on Aug. 30, The Crimson <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/1/ad-board-accused-students/"">published parts of it on Sept. 1, and other media outlets later reported on the email as well, prompting Harvard administrators to <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/11/faculty-reaction-searches/"">secretly search the email accounts of the resident deans in an effort to trace the origin of the leak.In the note, Ellison uses the acronyms “RWD,” indicating a requirement to withdraw, and “LOA,” meaning a leave of absence.Ellison's contact information, which was printed in the footer of the letter, has been omitted. From: Administrative Board
Sent: Thursday, August 16, 2012 5:46 PMCc: Weissman, AnnSubject: Case ProcessDear Colleagues:We have had some feedback from students about confusing messages in reference to possible sanctions for the Gov 1310 case. We do not yet know which students might be RWD (see last message) or just placed on probation (or less) and we don’t want to act as if we have a predetermined outcome. I would anticipate that if the Board voted to RWD a student, he or she would be RWD immediately and would be eligible to return next fall. If a student were to take a leave now we would no doubt convert the leave to RWD if we voted that way. However, a student taking a leave now may, in fact, not get RWD and needs to understand that the leave may stand.The only folks that may want to really consider an LOA are those students who know that they cheated. I think it is important for you to talk to them about being honest and forthcoming and remind them that only they know what happened but that we are working to understand it and except [sic] them to help us do just that.Fall term athletes may also want to consider taking an LOA before their first game. The reason this matters for athletes is that once they compete one time their season counts and they would lose eligibility if they had to take a year off and return. That said, these students should be sent to Nathan Fry for advice on their options and eligibility—let’s not get into advising students on NCAA rules. Please let me know if you have any questions.Jay--John (Jay) Ellison, PhD

The details are unclear, and so are faculty members. Just a day after news broke that Harvard administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of 16 resident deans, professors said the University may have overstepped its bound, calling its own policies into question.“I teach at Harvard—[I thought] something like this was never going to happen. And I must say that this story came as a real shock to me,” said mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid. Like other professors interviewed Sunday, Schmid said that news reports in the Boston Globe, the New York Times, and The Crimson were the first he had heard of the searches.Several other professors declined to comment on the record, fearing retaliation by University officials for criticizing them. Requesting anonymity, they explained that the news of the search has already had a chilling effect on the faculty.At issue is whether resident deans, who are also lecturers, are regulated by the University’s email policy for faculty or for staff. If the deans are considered faculty, then they must be notified before or immediately after a search. Given present information, the policy that pertains to staff is unclear.While faculty members are protected from unannounced searches like the ones carried out on the deans’ accounts, they said that the incident still sets a dangerous precedent.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who has been one of the strongest critics of the administration’s handling of the cheating scandal, wrote that his trust in the administration has only diminished in light of the email searches.“My assumption about the relative risks has now flipped. If something as innocuous as the leakage of the August 16 email justifies reading the email of a dozen faculty members, it is hard to know how low the threshold might be for invasion of our in- and out-boxes,” Lewis wrote in a <a href=""http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2013/03/email-privacy-at-harvard.html#comment-form"">blog post Sunday.History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 wrote on his public Facebook page that the search, which administrators said was in the best interest of students, actually worked against them.“This is disgraceful, even more so than the original cheating scandal, because it involves adults who should know better—really smart, powerful adults, with complete job security,” McCarthy wrote.McCarthy could not be reached for comment. Other professors said the searches did not come as much of a surprise, as all Harvard email accounts are potentially subject to monitoring by the University.“I just have long assumed that my emails were subject to searching, and I try to avoid having anything confidential in emails,” said senior lecturer in mathematics Paul G. Bamberg ’63, who lists a non-Harvard email address as his primary correspondence.Bamberg said that he is “surprised but not shocked” that the University would search the email accounts of faculty members, adding that he believes the administration has a right to look at Harvard email accounts.Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 went a step further, saying that as long as it was within the bounds of its own policy, the University made the right choice by searching the deans’ accounts to plug the leak of information.“I think the administration was trying to protect the privacy of students and that got into the way of the privacy of deans,” Mansfield said. “I think in this case, it’s the student who should have their privacy protected.”Either way, Schmid and others said that the faculty need to pressure administrators into greater transparency, although just what form such pressure might take is uncertain. The faculty was expected to discuss new academic integrity proposals, including one for a modified honor code, at its monthly meeting in April. Professors said that might be the venue to discuss administrators’ own integrity.“It is conceivable that there will be some explanation that will make all of this look benign, but I’ll have to wait and see,” Schmid said.—Staff writer Nicholas P.

Historically speaking, the resignation of the Pope seems a noteworthy moment in time. A prominent global figure in the religious (and previously the political) sphere, the Pope has long been instrumental in the shaping of society. For Catholics in particular, he is responsible for the central dogma by which they are expected to live their daily lives.Therefore, when Pope Benedict XVI announced his February 28 resignation from the church (the first willing resignation in six centuries), the news sent shockwaves through the religious community, if not the global community at large. Today we <a href=""http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/22827/"">await the imminent election of a papal successor, which theoretically means an opportunity for policy reform, as well as a chance to reignite a waning enthusiasm for Catholicism in nations worldwide.The sad truth of the matter is, however, that these changes are unlikely to transpire, and even those that do will be of a relatively little magnitude. While there is the possibility for small policy <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/europe/with-popes-resignation-focus-shifts-to-a-successor.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">changes such as allowing divorced Catholics to receive communion, or occasionally permitting the use of condoms to prevent AIDS, the candidates considered will likely echo their predecessor’s tendency toward extreme conservativism.What is more, the reelection of a European Pope will not offer the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/europe/with-popes-resignation-focus-shifts-to-a-successor.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">diversity that may appeal to Catholics in developing nations. While Cardinals Peter Turkson of Ghana and Odilo Scherer of Brazil are strong <a href=""http://www.paddypower.com/bet/novelty-betting/current-affairs/pope-betting"">contenders and would generate much-needed enthusiasm for Catholicism in African and Latin American nations, there is still a significant likelihood that the new Pope will hail from Europe once again. After all, two of the most probable <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-08/data-crunchers-turn-their-algorithms-on-the-papal-conclave"">candidates, Archbishop Angelo Scola and Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, are Italian.By continuing on this same trajectory, then, Pope Benedict XVI’s succession and the upcoming election offer little in terms of historical merit, especially considering the general tendency of modern-day Catholics to disregard papal doctrine. According to studies originally published in the <a href=""http://ncronline.org/news/fifth-survey-catholics-america-released"">National Catholic Reporter and later cited in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/opinion/bruni-the-popes-muffled-voice.html?_r=0"">The New York Times, over half of American Catholics are in favor of same-sex marriage, and other predominantly Catholic nations such as Argentina, Spain, and Portugal have even legalized the practice. In addition, on a more general scale, the church has seen an increase in the willingness of individuals to formulate their own moral judgments, irrespective of official Vatican teachings.
Nationwide and worldwide, therefore, Catholics have begun to develop a new identity separate from that of the Vatican. As the level of progressivity for modern-day Catholics continues to burgeon, one must call thereby into question the relevancy that a new Pope will have for members of the religious community. While the Pope does oversee the church’s mission of charity, and a new Pope may help with issues such as revamping the church’s image to bypass current associations with sexual assault, the Pope’s status as end-all arbiter of right and wrong has largely dissipated for today’s Catholics. As such, the upcoming papal election portends to be more prescribed than groundbreaking.Perhaps, however, there is a possibility for change, a possibility to align the beliefs of the church and its constituents once more, but this would require a transformation on behalf of the Vatican. Members of the Catholic community have already made it clear that they are not afraid to be progressive simply because it conflicts with the doctrines emanating from Rome.In this way, the historical significance of an event such as Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation is largely contingent on its sociopolitical impact. If Catholics continue to ignore the Pope’s teachings, then whatever doctrines are instituted by the newly elected Pope will have little influence on the ensuing religious beliefs of his “followers,” for they have already formulated their own.Thinking back to the last papal succession in history, the importance of this sociopolitical impact becomes increasingly clear. During this time, <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/pope-gregory-xii-pope-resign-article-1.1260755"">Pope Gregory XII ultimately resigned in order to ensure that Martin V would be his successor. This election resultantly ended the Western Schism, a period of religious turmoil in which two men claimed to be the Pope, generating a divide among the church and its citizens. The succession, then, gained historical merit due to the changes it ignited in the church and in society at large.The fact that this modern papal succession is the first in six centuries, therefore, does not necessarily qualify it as a moment of great historical significance. If the newly elected Pope, however, were to publicly endorse the usage of birth control or recognize the practice of same-sex marriage, then that would be one for the books.Aria N.

On a bus heading back to Harvard from NCAA Northeast Regionals in Queens, N.Y. on Sunday night, Crimson coach Peter Brand read the names of the 11 Harvard fencers who qualified for the NCAA Championships to be held later this month.St. John’s University hosted the regional tournament, which featured fencers from 18 different schools. Three of the universities were Top 10 varsity programs, including Harvard, St. John’s, and Columbia.The Crimson had five medalists at the end of the tournament, most notably sophomore foilist Brian Kaneshige, who snagged the gold medal in his weapon group.“[Kaneshige] definitely deserved it,” sophomore Emma Vaggo said. “He’s a great fencer, and he’s been working really hard this year and doing really well traveling to world cups…. He did a great job and fenced really well.”Kaneshige, heading into his final round with a tight score of 6-6 (+11), clinched the title after going 10-1 (+32). The sophomore edged out Eli Schenkel of St. John’s, who received the silver medal.
Freshman foilist Michael Woo medaled as well, registering a 19-4 (+48) finish to claim the bronze medal and join his teammate on the podium.“It feels great,” Wood said. “I didn’t really have super-high expectations. I’m just there to fence and do my best.”The freshman entered his final bouts 11-1, higher than that of Kaneshige when he headed into his closing bouts of the day.“It’s always really fun and really positive looking forward,” Vaggo said. “We’ve got three freshmen who qualified for NCAAs, which is really strong of them. You’re always nervous during regionals because you’re not used to fencing all day, but they all fenced really well and were strong physically and mentally, and we’re all excited to have them on our team.”Junior Lucas Lin also represented Harvard in the foil event, ranking 14th at the end of the day.Women’s foil also claimed a medal, with junior Alexandra Kiefer receiving the bronze. The podium finish marked Kiefer’s second career medal in the NCAA Regional tournament. Senior foilist Katherine Chou finished 14th.Men’s epée fencers failed to clinch a medal, but sophomore Peregrine Badger grabbed a spot in the top 10 and a nod to the NCAA Championships tournament.Vaggo clinched the silver in the women’s epée event, her second career regional medal.“It was such a long day,” Vaggo said. “To be honest, I think we are all just really happy to be done, but I pushed a little bit more to win the last bout to make sure I would end up going to NCAAs.”Freshman Nina van Loon and senior Felicia Sun finished seventh and ninth, respectively.

Only a handful of seconds had passed since he had learned his team was returning to the NCAA tournament when Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker burst into the Lavietes Pavilion lounge.Amaker hurried to senior Christian Webster and locked his captain in an embrace.In their four seasons together, Amaker and Webster have accomplished more than any player-coach combo in Harvard history, namely three Ivy League championships and two NCAA tournament berths.But while Amaker will presumably return to Cambridge for a shot at another Ivy League championship and another NCAA tournament berth, this is the end of the line for Webster.The Crimson’s lone senior, Webster played his final two games at Lavietes Pavilion over the weekend.
“It hasn’t really hit me yet to be honest,” Webster said after the Crimson’s 65-56 victory over Cornell on Saturday night. “I couldn’t have drawn it up any better—leaving the gym right now knowing that we are going to the tournament, having won the championship outright. There’s no better way for me to leave this thing.”Just a week ago, though, Webster and the Crimson’s chances of ending the season on top seemed bleak. Facing Penn last Saturday, Webster and his teammates walked off the court of the Palestra hanging their heads following a 75-72 loss that gave Princeton sole possession of first place in the league standings.Entering the final stretch of Ivy League play, Harvard needed a pair of victories over the weekend coupled with a Princeton loss to extend its season.The Crimson got more than that.The Tigers fell in back-to-back road contests at Yale and Brown while Harvard took care of business.After being honored at a pre-game ceremony on Friday, Webster scored two points in the Crimson’s 56-51 win over Columbia. On Saturday, he totaled seven points on five shots in a 65-56 win.The wins gave Webster 89 on his career, more than any other player in Harvard history.“Three Ivy titles in his four years and a captain and the winningest player in the history of Harvard basketball, you can’t say enough,” Amaker said. “He’s a guy that if you know him you are very happy and wishing good things for him.”In his final season, Webster has averaged 8.4 points and 3.0 rebounds per game while shooting 36.7 percent from beyond the arc. He’s also come up in the clutch for the Crimson on a number of occasions, most notably against Dartmouth when he hit three three-pointers in the final 93 seconds to force overtime.But perhaps more important to the Crimson’s success has been his role off the court. After Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew from the university in September, the Crimson was left with two vacancies at the captain positions

The Harvard men’s hockey team has run out of second chances.The Crimson’s turbulent season came to an abrupt close Sunday as three unanswered Dartmouth goals in the second period helped the Big Green past the Crimson, 6-3, in Hanover, N.H.. After conceding game one to Harvard (10-19-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) on Friday, Dartmouth (15-12-5, 9-9-4) took the final two contests of the first-round series to advance to the ECAC Tournament quarterfinals.“It’s frustrating for us because I felt that our guys really battled right to the end,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We did a lot of good things…. We felt that the game was headed in our direction after the first period.”Dartmouth will face Union in Schenectady, N.Y., for the next round of conference play on Friday. Meanwhile, Harvard will have to wait for next year. The Crimson, hampered by injuries and departures, struggled throughout the regular season and finished last in the ECAC for the first time in program history. But recent wins against Boston University and No. 1 Quinnipiac had signaled a possible late-season push.“We were excited coming in,” Donato said after Sunday’s loss. “It’s no secret, a couple of the things we dealt with. I was proud of the way we finished the last three or four weeks of the season. But there’s no question that we didn’t end up where we would have liked to given where we thought we were headed at the beginning of the season.”
On Sunday, two goals less than a minute apart allowed the Big Green to jump out to a 3-1 lead early in the second frame.Over six and a half minutes into the second period, Dartmouth freshman forward Tim O’Brien collected a deflected shot from teammate Mike Keenan and, uncontested, put the Big Green’s second goal past the right pad of a perplexed Raphael Girard, who was looking in the opposite direction in an attempt to locate the puck. Forty-nine seconds later, Eric Robinson batted a puck out of the air and between the pipes to give Dartmouth a 3-1 lead.After the first period, the Crimson appeared to head into the locker room with game-changing momentum after a strike from senior forward Luke Greiner with less than 32 seconds left in the opening frame. But Dartmouth quickly caught fire in the second, drawing even 2:28 into the second period off a successful stuff attempt from freshman forward Brad Schierhorn.The Big Green expanded on its lead early in the third as freshman forward Nick Bligh connected on a drop pass from classmate Connor Dempsey for a one-timer at the top of the right faceoff circle. Down 4-1, the Crimson pulled Girard in favor of freshman goaltender Peter Traber, who made his eighth career appearance in net.“We lost sight of the puck there a couple of times early,” Donato said. “I think we made mistakes all the way up and down the ice. But at that point, I think we needed a change just as much for the rest of the team than really pointing the finger [at Girard].”Harvard twice drew within two goals in the closing minutes as the Crimson outshot Dartmouth, 18-8, in the final frame. But each time, Dartmouth had an answer.With less than 13 minutes left in regulation, senior forward Luke Greiner picked up a loose puck high in the Big Green slot to score his second goal of the game. Dartmouth senior forward Dustin Walsh responded seven minutes later, bouncing a puck off the back of Traber from behind the Harvard net to put the Big Green up, 5-2, with less than six minutes left in regulation.In the closing minutes, freshman Crimson defenseman Desmond Bergin converted on a 6-on-4 opportunity after Harvard pulled Traber for an extra attacker on the power play. But with less than two minutes left, Schierhorn capped off a Dartmouth victory with an empty netter.A 2-1 win on Friday put the Crimson on the brink of advancing to the ECAC Tournament quarterfinals for the fourth straight season. But for the second time in four years, the Crimson dropped the last two games of a series in Hanover to fall to a higher-ranked Dartmouth squad. Harvard lost game two and game three of the 2010 quarterfinals at Dartmouth.Sunday was the final collegiate game for five Harvard seniors. Greiner finished the night with two goals and one assist while classmate and linemate Alex Fallstrom recorded his final NCAA point with an assist on Bergin’s goal. Captain Danny Biega, forward Marshall Everson, and defensemen Brendan Rempel also concluded their careers with the Crimson. Senior forward Connor Morrison was out of the lineup with an injury.—Staff writer Michael D. Ledecky can be reached at mdledecky@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter @mdledecky.

Despite a late-season injury that left coaches wondering if she’d be able to compete at all, Rebecca Nadler defied the odds as Harvard’s sole competitor at the NCAA Skiing Championships at the Middlebury Snowbowl.“I’m extremely proud of the effort that she put forward,” Crimson coach Tim Mitchell said. “It would be very easy to sell yourself short and cash it in and not give it everything you have.”The junior, who was last year’s champion in the giant slalom, turned in an 18th-place finish in the event on Wednesday and finished 23rd in the slalom on Friday.“I was really glad that I was able to be there,” Nadler said. “I gave it my all.”Nadler finished the giant slalom course with a total time of 2:08.86 over her two runs, just under five seconds slower than the overall winner, Kristine Haugen of Denver. Haugen, a freshman who has seen action on the international stage on the Norwegian national team, swept the women’s alpine events, also winning the slalom race
Nadler’s first run of 1:04.93 placed her in 17th. Her second run of 1:03.93 set her back on spot but was not enough to catch the field.Changing, tough conditions played a role in shuffling the final places of the skiers.“The snow honestly was a little unpredictable this weekend,” Mitchell said. “It would be a little choppy in places, but then it would be soft and then you’d hit a hard spot. People were getting bounced around a lot.”Two days later, Nadler returned to the slopes to compete in the slalom. Again, despite improvement between the first and second run—from 51.45 to 50.34—Nadler was unable to move up and finished in 23rd place overall.Nadler has been a key competitor for the Crimson all season, with several top ten and podium finishes this winter.“The week leading up to it wasn’t exactly what I was hoping for,” Nadler said. “I was injured and didn’t feel as prepared as I could have been but I went and tried my best so I’m really happy with the effort I put into it. I know the results will come, hopefully a little better next year.”—Staff writer Cordelia F. Mendez can be reached at cordeliamendez@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter @CrimsonCordelia.

After opening the season 2-3, the Harvard softball team dropped three games this weekend, going 1-3 in its second tournament of the season, the Winthrop Adidas Invitational in Rock Hill, S.C.. Runs were at a premium during the weekend, and the Crimson (3-6) found itself playing catch-up for most of the competition.“I think our offense needs to develop a sense of urgency,” sophomore infielder Katie Lantz said. “[We need to] work on scoring first, scoring more runs, and stringing together more hits.”WINTHROP 5, HARVARD 4The weekend finale pitted Harvard against Winthrop. In a back-and-forth game, with multiple lead changes, the Crimson ultimately fell in the bottom of the seventh on a walk-off home run, giving freshman Morgan Groom her second loss of the season.  With the loss, Harvard failed to at least split a day’s worth of games for the first time this season.Harvard only had three extra base hits all weekend, two of which were home runs by junior infielder Kasey Lange.
That said, the 1-3 weekend easily could have been a 3-1 weekend in many of the player’s minds, with the difference coming down to a few plays.“The pitchers had some great moments, definitely had some good games [and] the infield was a force for the team,” Lantz said. “I thought that we had some close games that we could have won.”The Crimson have played just two weekends this season, so many of the players are still stiff from the cold Cambridge winters where they are forced to practice inside the bubble on the football field. Many teams, such as Winthrop, have played as many as 22 games already.‘The more we play the better we do,” Olson said. “Just that confidence knowing that no matter what pitch the pitcher pitches we can succeed [will make the difference].”WESTERN ILL. 9, HARVARD 1Against Western Illinois, Harvard fell behind 2-0 in the top of the first inning on a two-out home run. After scoring one run in the first to cut the deficit in half, the Crimson failed to produce another hit, going down 9-1.“There were definitely moments of greatness,” junior captain Shelbi Olson said. “We just need to bring it together.… We definitely weren’t happy with our performance overall.”HARVARD 5, N.C. A&amp;T 1After barely falling to Delaware State, Harvard rebounded by topping North Carolina A&amp;T. The Crimson sent Groom to the mound against the Bulldogs. After falling behind 1-0 by surrendering two doubles in the second inning, Groom settled down to complete the game and strike out eight in a 5-1 victory.It was Groom’s first victory pitching for the team. Lange hit a three-run home run to give the Crimson the lead for good.DELAWARE ST. 5, HARVARD 4In its first game in the Winthrop Adidas Invitational, the Crimson fell behind, 4-1, to Delaware State during the first inning. Although it clawed back to tie the game in the top of the seventh, Harvard was foiled by a walk-off base hit in the bottom of the inning. Lange hit a solo home run for the Crimson in the loss.Next weekend, in its final weekend tournament trip of the season, the Crimson will travel to California for the San Diego Classic II. Harvard will face some of the best competition it will see all season, including Long Beach State and San Jose St. Many of the players are from California, so there is definitely an excitement to play in front of a home-state crowd.“California is great because the majority of our team is from out west, so we always have a lot of fans,” Lantz said.—Staff writer Jacob Lynch can be reached at jacoblynch@harvard.edu.

Going into the third event of the women’s pentathlon at this weekend’s NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships, freshman Martina Salander found herself sitting in 12th place in the 16-person competition.The rookie needed to put together a stellar finish in the last three events to even be in contention for the national title in the event.Then, with a single, personal-best heave of the shot put, Salander catapulted herself into third place.On the first of her three attempts, Salander tossed the shot 14.23 meters, 1.68 meters further than her closest competitor would manage.The mark earned her 809 points, while no other athlete netted greater than 700 in the event.
“[Last Monday in practice,] she had a series of eight or nine throws that were above her PR,” Harvard multi-events coach Kebba Tolbert said. “I couldn’t say that she was definitely going to throw 14.20…but I knew that she was going to PR and give herself a shot to score a lot of points in that event.”The freshman went on to set a new Ivy League record in the pentathlon, tallying 4209 points in the event en route to a fifth place finish and recognition as a first-team All-American. Salander, whose previous best point total in the event was 4138 points, became the first multi-event All-American in Crimson history.In addition to her impressive outing in the shot put, Salander jumped 5.85 meters in the long jump, which ties for the fifth best in school history. She went on to record a personal-best time in the 800 meter run, clocking in at 2:19.36.“The best multi-event athletes have balanced performances,” Tolbert said. “If you have one really bad performance, it can really hurt you in the overall scores…so we were just trying to keep doing what we’d been doing all year.”In total, three Crimson athletes—all from the Ivy-champion women’s squad—earned qualifying bids to nationals by placing in the top 16 in the nation in their respective events. Salander was joined by junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu, who earned her bid by breaking the Ancient Eight record in the weight throw, and sophomore middle distance runner Erika Veidis, whose qualifying time of 2:05.70 is the second fastest mark in the 800-meter in school history.Veidis punched her ticket to Fayetteville at last weekend’s Last Chance Meet, which was hosted by Columbia at the Armory Track and Field Center. The sophomore’s qualifying time was 15th out of the 16 competitors, which likely meant that she would have to set a new personal record if she hoped to be one of the eight women in the event finals.“The goal was to basically recreate the race from last weekend, where I just sat on a pretty hot pace and then was able to close,” Veidis said. “But I guess that’s trickier when the whole field is trying to do the same thing.”Assigned to the second heat of the preliminaries, Veidis toed the line against runners from perennial track and field powerhouses LSU and Oregon.The sophomore finished in sixth place in her heat, crossing the finish line in 2:06.69, almost exactly a second slower than her personal-best time. When the results from both heats were compiled, Veidis’ time earned her 10th place, just 0.54 seconds short of a spot in the finals.“It was a really aggressive race, which you would expect in the national championship 800,” Veidis said. “There was lots of elbowing and cutting off…. Usually I can run confidently and aggressively, but for some reason I just got jostled around and I wasn’t able to make it up after I got stuck in a bad position.”Away from the track, Ekechuwku was the first Harvard competitor to face off against the nation’s best, as the women’s weight throw was the meet’s first field event. In one of her first three throws, the junior needed to be in the top nine to advance to the event finals.Though Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, opened up the competition with a solid 19.64-meter heave, she would not improve on the mark in either of her next two attempts and finished in 12th place. Her performance earned her second-team All-American status, making the co-captain the first thrower on the women’s team to garner the distinction.“It’s a very, very high quality field and it’s a very intense competition,” Tolbert said. “To be able to come in and place higher than you were ranked coming in, that means you handled the pressure fairly well…. To get through to the national championship was a huge step for our program.”—Staff writer Dominic A. Martinez can be reached at dmartinez@college.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s hockey team earned a spot in the ECAC championship game for the first time since 2008 on Saturday afternoon at Lynah Rink. The No. 6/7 Crimson (24-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) defeated No. 5 Clarkson (28-9, 18-4), 4-2, despite being outshot by the Golden Knights in the semifinals matchup.Clarkson’s high-powered offense was responsible for two of Harvard’s six losses this season, beating the Crimson by a score of 3-1 in both games. But the third time was the charm on Saturday, as freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer—who was named tournament MOP—made 26 saves to help the team secure its chance to battle for the league title.“Everybody was ready, everybody played their role, and we had a lot of good energy,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We played Harvard hockey.”The Crimson tallied three goals before the Golden Knights could convert any of their 28 attempts on net. Freshman forward Mary Parker put the Crimson on the board just two minutes into the first period. Parker’s goal came after the puck was deflected off of a Clarkson defender’s helmet and into the net.“Tonight we were just ready to go out there and play the way that we can play and take it to them,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “We were fired up and didn’t let anything get in our way.”
Harvard was offensively dominant in the second period of play, outshooting the Golden Knights, 10-4. But it wasn’t until late in the second frame that Dempsey gave the Crimson its next goal off of a power play. Sophomore Sarah Edney sent the first shot, after a Clarkson hokoing penalty, rocketing towards the goal, giving Dempsey the chance to find the back of the net on a rebound.“Our power play has been great the past two games, but in the beginning [of the season] we were struggling,” Dempsey said. “We really needed that [goal] at that point in the game.”Harvard’s offensive momentum carried over to the beginning of the final period of play. Golden Knight goaltender Erica Howe, who was recently named ECAC goaltender of the year, continued to be showered with shots on net. Only three minutes into the frame, freshman forward Miye D’Oench, assisted by Parker, notched Harvard’s third unanswered goal of the game.“We got to the net [and] took some tough shots for the goaltender to handle,” Stone said. “She was off balance and had to go side-to-side, so we made it tough on her.”But Clarkson began to chip away at the Crimson lead with a goal from Jamie Lee Rattray. The Golden Knights then attempted to convert on a power play opportunity created by a Harvard hooking penalty. Clarkson went six-on-four, with Howe leaving the goal, trying to make up the two-point deficit.The Crimson maintained its top-ranked penalty kill, stopping the Golden Knights from finding the back of the net on any of its five power-play attempts. Parker then stepped in, scoring again with a short-handed goal off an assist from Dempsey. It was Parker’s eleventh goal of the season.“They’re stepping up, and they’re playing well,” Stone said of the team’s freshmen. “Their work ethic is what’s most important, and they’re doing a great job with that.”Clarkson converted on one final attempt to close the scoring with a goal from Vanessa Gagnon in the final 30 seconds of play.Maschmeyer, who was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year, moved to 3-0 in her playoff career with the win. The freshman’s shutout streak lasted for almost three entire games, but fell when the Golden Knights scored in the third frame.No one on the Harvard squad has ever been to the ECAC championship game, having dropped last year’s semifinals contest to St. Lawrence.“Every year [the semifinals] have been really close for us, and we come up short,” Dempsey said. “It’s been a real heartbreaker.”The Crimson was able to break the cycle of remaining semifinalists with the win, and the impressive playoff performances helped secure an NCAA tournament bid.“It’s amazing, since the beginning I’ve said that I have a tremendous amount of faith and confidence in this team and how hard we work and how hard we prepare,” Dempsey said. “It’s really great to see it payoff.”—Staff writer Claire K.

For the third time in as many years, the No. 6/7 Harvard women’s hockey team came tantalizingly close to an ECAC championship, only to watch it slip away once again.“That one stung,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “But it is amazing to know that we have another chance to make a go at things.”Despite falling to Cornell, 2-1, in the tournament final, the news was not all bad for the Crimson (24-3, 17-3-2 ECAC), who took home individual honors and an all-important NCAA tournament berth.After getting to the ECAC final by beating Clarkson and Dartmouth, Harvard fell to the Big Red in a trying back-and-forth affair. The regular-season champions outshot the Crimson, 34-19, en route to their third ECAC title in four years.Despite being on the losing end, freshman Emerance Maschmeyer took home some hardware. The goaltender was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player. Maschmeyer, who has seen the bulk of the playing time lately, allowed four goals in four tournament games while recording two shutouts.
“She’s been incredible for us all year,” Dempsey said.  “We set the bar really high and she has done more than we asked of her.”Goaltending has been a Crimson strong suit all season. Co-captain Laura Bellamy and freshman Maschmeyer have combined to record a 1.14 goals against average. The combined mark is good for second in the country.“They made the job easier on me,” Maschmeyer said of her teammates.The freshman was beat with just minutes left in regulation. The go-ahead goal came off the stick of Jessica Campbell who was setup after the Harvard defense blocked a shot in close. Maschmeyer was out of position to make the stop after she came up to stop Campbell’s first attempt.The opportunity came on the man-advantage after junior forward Kaitlin Spurling was called for interference.Cornell capitalized against a Crimson penalty kill that had staved off five power plays and a five-on-three in the first two periods.“Our penalty kill was great,” Dempsey said. “We always have a lot of confidence in it. Tonight, it was about discipline. It was about grinding it out.”The nation’s best unit had experienced tremendous success, stopping its opponents on the 21 attempts prior to the broken play.Harvard could manage just one shot to Cornell’s 10, but Maschmeyer handled each Cornell advance in a scoreless second period that featured multiple power-play opportunities.“We played hard and put ourselves in a position where we still have a chance,” Dempsey said.

Co-captain Walter Peppelman took the mat Saturday to compete in the EIWA Championships final in the 157-pound weight class. After having early success in the tournament, Peppelman met his match in Joseph Napoli of Lehigh, who edged out the senior in a 5-0 decision to claim the title. The match was Peppelman’s second career final at the tournament.Peppelman not only left the tournament with a second place finish, but the senior also got a nod for nationals later this month.“I thought I had a pretty good weekend up until today, and then I didn’t perform as well as I would have liked to,” Peppelman said. “I ended up losing a tough one in the final, which stung a little bit, but I look forward to getting that win back in nationals.”Although Harvard fell shy of its goal of being in the top five at the EIWA Championships this weekend in New Brunswick, N.J., the Crimson left the tournament with eight place-winners and a seventh place finish, its highest placing since 2007.Harvard sent one other wrestler to the finals on Saturday—sophomore James Fox. At 197 lbs., Fox competed against Micah Burak, who has had four career EIWA finals appearances. The Crimson sophomore suffered two takedowns in the first and second periods and allowed Burak to rack up riding time in the final frame. Fox finished as the runner-up with Burak securing a 6-3 decision.
“I wrestled him before, a couple weeks ago, and lost to him,” Fox said. “I had a good idea of what he was going to do when I went into the match. My main goal was to stay out of tie-ups, keep moving my hands and feet…. Unfortunately I didn’t completely accomplish that, which is why I lost to him. I wrestled hard for all seven minutes, so I was proud of myself for that, and I had the game plan in my head, but the execution wasn’t fully there, so that was a little disappointing.”Fox may have finished without a title, but the sophomore will be traveling to Des Moines, Iowa for the NCAA Championships along with Peppelman and co-captain Steven Keith.“At the end of the day, I’m happy,” Fox said. “I qualified for nationals, and I was wrestling in the finals…. I look forward to wrestling at nationals, and if I see [Burak] again, hopefully it’ll be a different story.”The next highest place-winner on the Harvard team was Keith, who secured a fourth-place finish at 141 and was the first Crimson qualifier for the national tournament.Keith advanced to the semifinals after definitive decisions of 6-0 and 9-3 over wrestlers from Columbia and Lehigh, respectively. The senior was unable to secure a championship final appearance after losing a 6-3 decision to Penn’s CJ Cobb.“At the end of the day, we have three national qualifiers,” Peppelman said. “Steven is qualifying for his fourth national tournament, which is something pretty rare in our history.”The Crimson almost sent a fourth wrestler to the NCAA tournament in freshman Jeffrey Ott. At 125, Ott clinched fifth place, coming one win shy of qualifying for nationals. The freshman came out of the gates strong, forcing a technical fall in his opening match against Hunter Wood of Army, and earning an 18-3 decision.Ott’s second match results did not swing in the freshman’s favor, when No. 4 David Terao of American pinned him for the win.The freshman went on to secure two decisions in the consolation bracket, advancing him to the match for an appearance in the third place match and an automatic bid for the national tournament on Saturday. Ott lost a 4-3 decision, finishing the tournament in fifth-place after securing a 13-0 major decision over Wood.“A lot of our guys placed,” Fox said. “I think we wrestled well as a team, especially at the beginning of the tournament, but we got to the second day, and I think we were worn out a little bit and not capitalizing on all the opportunities…. By the fourth or fifth match, you’re pretty banged up and sore, and it’s tough to perform at 100 percent.”The other Harvard wrestlers who placed in the EIWA Championships include freshman Devon Gobbo, who placed seventh, and senior Shay Warren, junior Cameron Croy, and sophomore David Ng who all snagged eight place finishes.“We’re just focusing on little things, small little tweaks,” Fox said. “Looking to attack the opposite side of the body that is not our strong side…little things like that will go a really long way. We have a week and a half to keep working hard.”—Staff writer Kelley Guinn McArtor can be reached at kgmcartor@college.harvard.edu.

UPDATED: March 11, 2013, at 9:43 p.m.The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers reached a tentative agreement on the details of a new contract with the University, ending the longest negotiations in the union’s history.The tentative contract, which is pending ratification by HUCTW members, includes a first-year wage increase of 3.4 percent for a typical HUCTW member with at least one year of service at the University. It also calls for two more salary increases at the same rate in 2013 and 2014.The rate of the salary increases was one of the most debated topics between the two sides in the negotiations. HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that he thought the wage increase, which is smaller than those during previous boom years with higher inflation but larger than those the union saw in the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/7/1/union-contract-members-university/"">2010 agreement right after the financial crisis, was very appropriate for this point in time.“Our members, more than anything else, have cared about having some meaningful real wage growth, and that is in there for sure,” Jaeger said.
Leaders on both sides said they are satisfied with the result of the negotiations.“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement that is fair for the University and the members of the HUCTW,” Harvard’s Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote in an email to The Crimson. “We value and recognize the important role that HUCTW members play every day at Harvard, and we look forward to moving ahead together with the work of the University.”One issue that remains without a solution is healthcare benefits. The tentative agreement refers all unresolved health care issues to a newly created HUCTW-Harvard Health Care Negotiating Group, which will meet frequently in an attempt to find a mutually agreeable solution.While Jaeger said he believes the negotiating group will be able to come to an agreement, he recognizes that health care is a difficult and long-term problem.“I don’t think it’s going to be quick or easy...but at least we’ve got a new framework and a new way of thinking about it and maybe some hopeful and positive attitudes coming out of this agreement,” Jaeger said.If ratified by HUCTW members in a vote on April 2, the new contract will go into effect retroactively for July 1, 2012, and will expire on September 30, 2015.HUCTW is planning meetings with its members in the next few weeks to ensure that they understand the details of the new contract before their ratification vote on April 2. Jaeger said he is confident that the union's members will approve the contract.—Staff writer Christine Y. Cahill can be reached at christinecahill@college.harvard.edu.

This weekend has seen Crimson athletes in action on the national scene. Junior Rebecca Nadler tried her hand at defending her title in skiing this week and three female athletes competed at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships in Arkansas, marking the first time since 2009 that Harvard has sent women to the championships. As these sportswomen return to campus, the Crimson looks ahead to other athletes seeking national success in the month of March.
<a name=""jump"">
Wrestling
The Harvard team has just finished competing at the 2013 EIWA Championships and on Mar. 21 several athletes will be travelling to Iowa to strive for national glory. Leading the pack will be All-American Steven Keith. The Senior’s 102 career wins currently rank him seventh in Harvard history and he will be looking to build off his eighth place finish in 2012.
 
Fencing
This Sunday Mar. 10 will see Harvard’s male and female fencers heading to St John’s University to compete at the NCAA Northeast regional. Success there will enable qualify individuals for the championships in San Antonio in two weeks time. As it did in 2012, the Crimson will be trying to send the maximum of twelve fencers to the championships. Given the national title is awarded as a coed team, every fencer will be needed to increase the chances of national team glory for Harvard.
 
Swimming
While the Crimson tries to end Princeton’s four year reign over the Ivy Championships this weekend, individuals will be looking to post NCAA ‘A’ qualifying times to guarantee them a spot at the NCAA Championships in Indianapolis at the end of the month. Sophomore Chuck Katis has already booked his ticket. The breaststroker is currently ranked in the top ten nationally over both 100 and 200 meters and will be seeking to prove himself on the national stage.
 
Women’s Hockey
Despite falling in the ECAC finals to Cornell, the Harvard squad will travel across town to Boston College on March 16th for the first round of the NCAA tournament. The game is their first appearance since the ‘09-10 season, when this year’s senior class fell to Cornell in the first round as freshmen. The winner of this match-up will travel to Minneapolis for the women’s Frozen Four.

After the conspicuous absence of strobe lights and pulsing music on the late-night routes of the Yard-Quad Express prompted rumors a week ago that “the party shuttle” had been shut down for good, this past weekend saw the revelry return in subdued form.The evening shuttle bus driven by Melvin Washington, Jr. on weekends has been dubbed the “party shuttle” by undergraduates, so named for its blaring external speakers, flashing club-style lights, and student dancing. But this weekend, after Harvard officials suspended the bus’s unorthodox features, Washington turned off the strobe lights, unplugged the external speakers, and instead played loud music from the bus’s speaker system.Washington said the party shuttle was recently taken under review by administrators after a YouTube video of students dancing on the shuttle surfaced.The “added features” on the bus have been “put on hold” until an evaluation of the safety of the shuttle can be conducted, Director of Transit and Fleet Management David E. Harris, Jr. wrote in a statement.“We need to confirm that these additions to the experience of riding the shuttle are not impairing the driver’s ability to operate the vehicle safely, and that the atmosphere is not adversely affecting the ridership,” Harris wrote.
Washington said that he believes it is better for students to have fun in the controlled environment of his bus than out on the streets of Cambridge at night.“I can’t control these kids. They’re going to do this stuff whether I have a party shuttle or not,” Washington said.Moreover, Washington said he always strives to keep the students riding on his bus safe during the entirety of the ride, by driving under the speed limit, for example.“If you’re on my shuttle, I’m going to make sure you’re safe from the time you get on to the time you get off,” he said.Students and alumni have been quick to come to Washington’s defense. Messages sent over email lists urge students to contact Campus Services to protest the potential shutdown of the party shuttle.Frequent riders of the party shuttle said they are disappointed about the increased regulation of the beloved bus.“[The party shuttle] has been a cheery thing after a night out, and I’m definitely for it,” said Blake Zenuni ’13. “Melvin is really into it, and it can be a good thing for safety reasons.”—Staff writer Laya Anasu can be reached at layaanasu@college.harvard.edu.

Macky Sall, president of Senegal, delivered the keynote address of the fourth annual Harvard African Development Conference on Friday afternoon. The conference, titled “Visible Change in Africa: One Innovation at a Time”, was organized by seven Harvard schools and lasted through Saturday night.Sall—who rose from civil servant to president in a little more than a decade—discussed democratic ideals and the developmental challenges that Senegal and the African continent face.“We must lay down the weapons,” Sall said of Africa. “We must put aside what divides us and continue to talk about what unites us.”Sall, who spoke through a translator for much of the event, said the primary objectives the continent and Senegal must strive to achieve include improving the design of political institutions, guaranteeing social justice, and upgrading Senegal’s economic status to that of a middle-income nation.Likening Africa to Asia, he expressed his desire for the entire continent to emerge as an “African tiger.” Accomplishing this, Sall said, would require foreign countries and groups to cease giving handouts and instead invest in Africa, which he referred to as “the next frontier after Asia.”
Since coming into power in 2012, Sall has sought to bolster the democratic process in a west African nation that has been beleaguered by a 50 percent poverty rate and a per capita income of only $2000.To raise the standard of living, his government is in the process of developing a “Senegalese New Deal,” which includes improved access to basic health care, reduction in payroll taxes, and a new welfare program.“[The Senegalese New Deal] is also a necessary condition for peace and stability,” Sall said. “All too often, extreme poverty leads to revolts and extremism.”After these steps, Sall said that he hopes to “go beyond eradicating poverty, to create durable wealth and prosperity for our people in a peaceful, regional context.”He also encouraged members of the African diaspora to return to their native lands, but first “accept in your head already to go back to your country and serve in the real conditions of your country.”At the end of Friday’s address, Sall answered questions from audience members. When asked about his plans for the gay community of Senegal—where homosexuality is a criminal offense—he said that though he was a “strong proponent of minority rights”, the government should not “impose certain viewpoints [on] society.”Sall was welcomed by a conference coordinator, Harvard Kennedy School student and Lowell house tutor Layusa Isa-Odidi ’09.“Four years ago, we began an experiment: the African Development Conference,” she said, “We really wanted to increase the visibility of the African continent at Harvard.”Sall came into power after facing adversary in Senegal. In 2008, Sall was ousted from Senegalese politics by his predecessor for demanding improved transparency in the executive branch. He went on to found his own party, the Alliance for the Republic, and was elected president in 2012 in a free and peaceful election validated and praised by western observers.Prior to his election, his opponent—the incumbent president—amended the Senegalese constitution, increasing the number of presidential terms legally permitted from two to three. Sall, elected to a seven-year term, has since reduced term-length to five years, effective beginning with his own presidency.—Staff writer Steven R.

In an attempt to improve the referenda process ahead of a planned spring ballot, Undergraduate Council representatives voted on Sunday night in favor of legislation that would raise the voting turnout needed to make a referendum binding.The threshold for referenda results to be considered “binding”—a term for when a referendum becomes official UC policy—was set to at least a 50 percent turnout of the student body.Previously, a referendum question only needed to be considered if the lower of two thresholds was exceeded: 25 percent of the student body, or the percentage of students who voted in the fall UC representative elections.Adams representative Antone Martinho ’13, who introduced the amendment to the legislation to change the voter threshold, said the existing policy set the bar too low.“I think that for passing referenda which are supposed to be binding on us, the representatives of the student body, 25 percent is ridiculous,” Martinho said.
Another amendment eliminated a clause from the initial legislation that would have changed the signature requirement for ballot consideration from 10 percent of the student body to 10 percent of those who voted in the last UC presidential election.Some representatives expressed serious concern about the proposed change in the number of signatures required for consideration of a question, which would be almost halved as a result of the legislation.Another change allows the UC to work with a neutral third-party—likely the IOP’s Harvard Public Opinion Project, according to UC Rules Committee Chair Christopher A. Smiles ’15—to ensure questions are not biased.Additionally, statements and rebuttals to referendum questions will also be published on the UC website and on the ballot.According to Smiles, these changes were incorporated from looking at other referendum models.“We were pointed to the California referendum system by Drew Faust and some others,” Smiles said.The Council meeting also featured two speakers, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.Harris listened to student feedback and answered questions on the recent <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/2/7/cue-meeting-reading-period/"">proposal to change reading period.Though some representatives expressed their support for the proposal, others were concerned about potential impacts to timely grade reporting and to workload immediately before and after reading period.Catalano, who spoke on the topic of active shooter response at Harvard, explained HUPD’s procedures should a situation arise and said that HUPD has been working with the MIT, Cambridge, and Boston police departments to develop a common response system.—Staff writer Steven S.

The mystery of Commencement was resolved. Some were ecstatic, and others disgruntled. The more <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2135/3/7/oprah-commencement-comparison/"">imaginative amongst us voiced hope that diplomas would be bestowed upon the graduating class in histrionic fashion, perhaps along with a <a href=""http://www.oprah.com/own-tv-guide-magazines-top-25-best-oprah-show-moments/TV-Guide-Moment-4-Oprahs-Car-Giveaway"">fleet of brand new sport cars. Oprah Winfrey, the University announced, was <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/3/4/oprah-winfrey-2013-commencement/"">chosen to deliver this year’s Commencement address.Shortly thereafter, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis expressed <a href=""http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2013/03/oprah-at-harvard-part-ii.html"">concerns that a “major purveyor of pseudoscience” would be awarded an honorary Harvard degree. Despite criticisms from Lewis and others, we at the Crimson unequivocally applaud the recognition that will be given to someone who is in many ways a role model and whose work has done much to advance causes that are dear to the Harvard community.By and large, Lewis’s argument that Oprah is a popularizer of pseudoscience is not an entirely inaccurate one. That this should be relevant to the choice of her as Harvard’s Commencement speaker, however, we contest. True, Oprah has often hosted at her record-breaking talk show persons of questionable opinions about medicine and self-improvement, exposing millions of her viewers to pseudoscientific arguments. She has given <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/05/29/live-your-best-life-ever.html"">space to guests who have advocated such viewpoints as the legitimacy of unconventional hormone therapies to combat the effects of menopause or proposed anti-vaccination stances not backed by cogent public health arguments. Yet such episodes are irrelevant to the occasion of Commencement and are overshadowed by many of Oprah’s other experiences and achievements. Her extraordinary story of determination in the face of adversity, her progress in advancing the status of women and members of ethnic minorities, and her role in abating prejudice against LGBTQ Americans all make her more than qualified to speak on life’s challenges, success, and living a meaningful life in front of Harvard’s graduating class.Most of us are probably familiar with Oprah’s success story: Born in poverty to a single teenage mother, she overcame the trauma of rape and early pregnancy, went on to become the first and only black female <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1939458_1939454_1939448,00.html"">billionaire in the world, and <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1993621_1994046_1993961,00.html"">appears repeatedly on Time magazine’s list of most influential people. As early as the 1980s, she <a href=""http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Gay-Issues-on-The-Oprah-Show"">defended gay, lesbian, and transgender rights in the United States, harnessing her incredible influence to further the quest for civil rights of millions of LGBTQ Americans.In light of the enormous impact that Oprah has had on the lives of millions and the role that she plays in public life, that she has popularized views that are at odds with mainstream academia seems an awfully myopic criticism. The University would indeed be hard-pressed to identify any Commencement speaker whose values have never come into conflict with objective scholarship. If one of the goals of a Harvard education is to interact with and learn from those who are different from us, then Oprah, whose work is decidedly non-academic but similarly powerful and valuable, certainly fits the bill. We look forward to hear her talk of confidence, courage, and hardship with the same strength that has characterized her throughout her career as an entertainer.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!This year, Adams House seems to be pushing its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oKsPCGEOzI"">dining hall and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx2D1cp5Ahw"">gold digs as its main perks. But as anyone who knows and loves this occasionally war-mongering House will tell you, there's a lot more to Adams than meets the eye. A perennial favorite, centrally-located Adams is the House of gargoyles, gilded walls, and a whole lot more (the list, as you'll see, goes on and on).<!--more-->House Spirit: Adams residents have proven their fierce loyalty to their Gold Coast home time and again by being some of the most active players in Harvard's occasional House Wars. The Pfoho-Adams War of 1999 was so seismic that it earned a few lines of text on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pforzheimer_House#Dispute_with_Adams_on_dining_access_.28known_as_the_Pfoho-Adams_War.29"">Wikipedia. And although Currier allegedly initiated the poll-tampering that sparked conflict in the <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/29/great-house-wars-timeline/"">2012 Interhouse War, Adams was the first House to formally declare war.When they're not signing treaties or mapping battle plans, students spend time bonding at the weekly event ""Carpe Noctem,"" where they enjoy beer, pizza, and elaborately themed decorations.Housing Quality: Adams House offers a variety of rooming options that leave most students very satisfied with their cribs. With most sophomores living in n housing, residents have a chance at snagging singles all three years. Like the rest of Adams House, the rooms are quintessentially Harvard, complete with dark wood accents and other pleasing, old school aesthetic touches. And while Claverly is located a bit farther from the rest of the House, the building retains some of its former <a href=""http://adamshouse.harvard.edu/site-page/claverly-hall"">Gold Coast swank, plus a floor set-up that makes it perfect for socializing.
Dining Hall: Few people have been known to complain about the looks of the Adams dining hall. Many more, however, have been heard complaining about the dining hall being overcrowded during lunch and dinner; despite restrictions, it seems that freshmen from the Yard and upperclassmen friends from the River (and beyond) still manage to sneak their way into the centrally-located facility. Residents of Pforzheimer House have also been allowed to eat in Adams since their victory in the Pfoho-Adams War of 1999. If the excess of Pfoho interlopers proves too much, however, the House has a small dining hall located off the main room where students can study and eat in a quieter environment.Facilities: The majority of the House is connected by underground tunnels that bear colorful murals and images of Winnie the Pooh. Supposedly, there are courtyards, too, though Adams guards them from non-House residents. The House has a Gold Room that makes for a great picture to show friends back home. Students use the Pool Theater for theatrical productions and movie screenings. The House library is beautiful, open 24 hours a day, and restricted to Adams residents. And while Winthrop residents may boast that JFK (perhaps/probably) had some sexual escapades in their House, the future president worked on his senior thesis in the Coolidge Room in Adams' Randolph Hall; not quite as kinky, but still a great space to do work. House Masters: Adams House is currently enjoying the <a href=""http://adamshouse.harvard.edu/site-page/palfrey-era"">Palfrey Era, which we're inclined to call the Golden Age. <a href=""http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/3/24/judy-people-out-walk/"">John G. ""Sean"" Palfrey '67 and Judith S. ""Judy"" Palfrey '67 are two of the best-loved House masters you'll find at Harvard. Not only do they know every House resident by name, they also invite students to study and munch on snacks at their residence every Sunday (and have been known to dress in drag at the Adams House Drag Night). And if all that isn't enough, has any other House master taken the time to compile a <a href=""http://adamshouse.harvard.edu/100-things-do-adams"">list that rivals Dr. Palfrey's ""100 Things To Do in Adams""? We didn't think so.Extra: A number of pretty cool people once lived in these hallowed halls (though some did so before the buildings were collectively known as Adams House). Notable former residents include the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, actor Jack Lemmon '47, and Henry Kissinger '50 (who lived in Claverly). The Bow &amp; Arrow Press holds weekly open houses that allow students a chance to hang out and print posters, invitations, and cards. Black tie readings of Winnie the Pooh and the House's Winter Feast are other popular Adams House traditions. The only real downside of the House may be occasional visits from River critters and hungry Crimson editors (who are already planning next year's House rankings).Our rankings so far:4.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!Kirkland residents act like Yale students during Harvard-Yale weekend: they just can't stop telling you how great their House is and how much better they are by association. Sure, we'd like them to tone it down a bit and maybe stop making out with each other, but unlike the Yalies, Kirkland students genuinely have a lot to brag about. From the great location to the homey vibe, Kirkland looks like it's straight out of a Harvard catalogue, causing us to wonder why Mark Zuckerberg decided to leave early.<!--more-->Housing Quality: Kirkland housing is a mixed bag. Some upperclassmen luck out with big common rooms and spacious singles, but the House is also littered with walkthrough rooms and n suites. All of the rooms, however, are wood-paneled with plenty of natural lighting, and few students end up with bunk beds or cramped triples. In other words, it's definitely better than Winthrop for space and beats the concrete jungle that is Mather in looks, but the tradeoff is the chance that your room will be small.Above all, though, it's all about location, location, location. With rooms right next to all the River Houses and JFK Street, but closer to the Yard than most, Kirkland House is in the perfect spot for many. With its Old Harvard vibe and cozy atmosphere, people walking into Kirkland might let out a sigh and say, ""Ah, now this is Harvard.""Dining Hall: Kirkland's dining hall is the most intimate on campus. There are many tables that seat only four people, which is well suited for one of the smaller Houses on campus. Also, because the dining hall serves fewer people than other Houses do, many say the food is of a higher quality (though the kitchen is shared with Eliot). Kirkland residents report they can always find a friendly face in the dining hall, and it's close enough to the Yard for students to make it back for lunch. There is also outdoor seating available, which is nice on the two days a year when it's warm enough outside to venture forth without a parka.
Facilities: Kirkland has plenty of common rooms, a community kitchen, a House gym, and a basement ping pong area. The House also has a spectacular library housed in the contiguous Hicks House building next door. Kirkland uses its Junior and Senior Common Rooms to great effect for its incredible Conversations with Kirkland series, where Kirkland residents get to sit in on discussions with famous politicians, artists, and academics. Today the former President of Mexico, Felipe Calderon spoke there. Past guests include Drew Faust, Nate Silver, and Salma Hayek.House Masters: Kirkland residents report being extremely pleased with their House Masters, Tom and Verena Conley, who are truly a one of a kind pair. The two can often be seen eating in Kirkland dining hall or walking their Bernese Mountain dogs around town. They are both Professors at the College (Tom in Romance Languages and Literature and VES, Verena in Romance Languages and Literature and Literature), giving them additional connections to the undergraduate community. As an added bonus, Tom offers a Kirkland wine seminar in the spring to all Kirkland residents (21+) during which he imparts his words of wisdom about all things Sauvignon Blanc. Let's just say not all House Masters are as willing to teach their residents about the finer things in life.Extra: If wine's not your thing, you can join the Kirkland Brew Club, which makes several different House brews for fellow Kirklanders to sample at Stein Clubs. The House also boasts several other special, Kirkland-only events. Residents are known to go way, way overboard for Secret Santa week in December. And finally, of course, there is Incestfest, the annual Kirkland-only hook up party. Talk about brotherly (and sisterly) love.Our rankings so far:3.

Millions of Americans hear her voice on the radio each week, but members of the Harvard community had a chance to see National Public Radio reporter and “All Things Considered” host Melissa J. Block ’83 speak in person on Monday afternoon.Block, who has co-hosted the daily news program since 2003, delivered a lecture at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study titled “‘All Things Considered’ Considered.” During the talk, Block reflected on her career in journalism and the changes facing the industry as it becomes increasingly digital.In an interview before the talk, Block told The Crimson she hoped she would teach her audience more about the radio industry.“[I hope they] stop and think about what makes radio special, to some extent,” Block said. “It’s something I’ve devoted my entire working life to and am very protective of and passionate about.”Block encorporated several audio clips into her talk. Block gave the audience a glimpse into a day in the life of the production team of “All Things Considered,” as well as several clips from past reports. One clip featured Block interviewing a family that had been searching for their son soon after the May 2008 earthquake that hit Chengdu, China. Block said the clip served as an example of “intimate storytelling,” something Block said NPR especially values.
“We really like to let our best stories breathe,” Block said. “Even as our attention spans shrink and our thoughts are boiled down into 140-character tweets, we [still believe we can] keep our listener hooked and actively engaged with dynamic storytelling.”Block also discussed the rise of the competitive media culture, in which news outlets race to report breaking news first. She emphasized the importance of careful and accurate reporting despite the competition.Harold N. Eyster ’16 said he appreciated the opportunity to hear Block’s take on the news industry.“I’ve always listened to Melissa Block on the radio and thought it would be great to see her in person and hear her reflections on her role in radio,” he said.­—Staff writer Madeline R.

 The Harvard Kennedy School is known for impassioned speeches and debates about the current state of politics, not of art. Yet on February 28,  students and faculty from the Graduate School of Design and the Graduate School of Education squeezed into a small room of HKS’s Taubman Building for a panel entitled, “Are Arts Relevant in a 21st Century World?” organized by the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations. Within five minutes, one of the panelists, Carol Coletta, director of the nonprofit organization ArtPlace, answered with a rhetorical question: “Is breathing relevant?”After her joking retort, the panelists moved on to practical discussions. Rather than discuss the initial prompt, the panelists used their time to consider concrete initiatives for making art more relevant.There was no doubt among the panelists that the place of the arts in contemporary information society is under siege. Jim Bildner, who moderated the event, and is a Senior Research Fellow at the Hauser Center specializing on the sustainability of the arts in US cities, reported that foundational giving to the arts declined by 10 percent since the 2007-2009 recession. Though they are now beginning to recover some of their financial footing, Bildner said, arts and cultural institutions can no longer rely exclusively on the patronage of artistic elites, who flock to the opera, theater, and ballet in dwindling numbers.Dennis Scholl, the other panelist and Vice President of Arts for the Knight Foundation, a private nonprofit for media innovation, proposed a solution. “The only way the arts can stay relevant in the 21st century is by becoming part of the community and allowing more people to participate,” he said. To that end, Scholl talked about the national initiative he launched called “Random Acts of Culture,” which organizes spontaneous flash mobs to Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” and opera performances in public malls, as well as <a href=""http://vimeo.com/17332482#at=0"">other cultural events.  In a clip that he showed of one of these acts, unsuspecting bystanders showed their enthusiasm by whipping out their iPhones rather than actually participating. But Scholl did not seem perturbed by this reaction. “How many people in a concert hall participate? The point is they were there to witness it,” he said after the panel.
 Coletta, also a former Knight Foundation fellow, has taken up Scholl’s concept of taking the arts to the streets but has the art a more permanent setting. Her organization, ArtPlace, has awarded $26.9 million in the form of 80 grants to 76 organizations in 46 places in the US  in cross-collaboration with leading artists, banks, municipal governments, federal agencies, and the National Endowment for the Arts. “[Our mission is to] put ‘art’ at the ‘heart’ of portfolio strategies to transform community,” she said.  What this means is investing in the arts a profitable and sustainable public-private venture. ArtPlace is unique, however, in not thinking about urban art as beautification but as “creative placemaking,” which, according to ArtPlace’s website, is a strategy that aims to use art to revitalize overlooked spaces.Instead, as a seasoned CEO,  she discussed the metrics used to measure the projects’ success: the “vibrancy” and “diversity” they add to the community. “These metrics can be fuzzy,” she said. However, much data-collection and reporting went into their calculation, Coletta said to the audience.More than one audience member took issue with the metrics. Other audience members questioned why art needs to produce a return on investment to be valuable. At this point, Bildner spoke up. “Of course art is inherently valuable. The question is whether it is being valued by as many people as it could,” he said.<p style=""display: inline !important;"">The two panelists’ aspirations have a common thread: to popularize the arts and their practical applications and to shift conversation about the arts away from the Barker Center and into the Kennedy School, thus making art an effective policy tool for change.—Staff writer Katya Johns can be reached at kjohns@college.harvard.edu.

This team was supposed to be defined by the scandal.This team’s only senior averaged sixteen minutes a game last year.This team’s second tallest rotation player is 6-7. Princeton’s shortest starter is 6-5.This team wasn’t supposed to win the Ivy League.But here we are.
The Harvard men’s basketball team (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) has faced adversity all season long. From the opening game, a 67-64 loss on a UMass wing trey with three seconds to go, to the road sweep last week at the hands of the Killer P’s, nothing has come easy. Losing graduates Keith Wright and Oliver McNally was going to be hard enough, but the withdrawals of Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey in the wake of the Gov 1310 scandal forced the team to change the entire way it played.Somehow, the team found an answer for every stumbling block.Suddenly, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers was thrust into the starter’s role without a true backup. He was up to the challenge. Chambers played every game, leading the team in assists and minutes played. Without a strong inside post presence, coach Tommy Amaker reverted to unorthodox four-guard lineups featuring Chambers, sophomore Wesley Saunders, junior Laurent Rivard, and senior Christian Webster. No matter. The Crimson shot 39.9% from behind the arc, good for third in the nation. After losing four of its top five scorers, Harvard lacked a go-to scorer. Saunders stepped up. The sophomore led the Ivy league with an efficient 16.5 point a game on 54 percent shooting from the field (53 percent from three) and led the team in steals while serving as its best perimeter defender.The Crimson will enter the NCAA tournament as a likely 14 or 15 seed. The team’s nonconference schedule is chock-full of near-misses; chances to post statement wins at UConn, St. Mary’s, and Memphis resulted in close losses. It posted only four wins in conference play by double digits, with eight games decided by fewer than seven points. However, Harvard heads into the tournament with recent history on its side.Since 2010, Ivy League teams have posted a respectable 2-3 record in March Madness. The Cornell Sweet Sixteen team of 2010 is in a class of its own. That squad posted an absurd 15.4 average margin of victory en route to a 13-1 Ancient Eight record and dismantled Temple and Wisconsin by a combined 34 points in its first two tournament games. The next year, a 25-7 Princeton Squad held its ground start-to-finish against a Kentucky team that made the Final Four and sent 5 players to the NBA in a 59-57 loss. Last year, the Crimson fell to a talented Vanderbilt squad, 79-70, that recorded one of two wins over national champion Kentucky and had starters Festus Ezeli, John Jenkins, and Jeffrey Taylor drafted in the first 31 picks of the 2012 NBA draft.In addition, the Crimson's post-season chances are boosted by the recent trend of parity in college basketball. Whether it is the preponderance of ‘one-and-done’ freshmen that sprint to the NBA after one year of college hoops or improved recruiting in the Ivy League, the numbers point to parity across the college basketball landscape. Only two years ago two mid-major programs made the Final Four.  The current number one team in the nation, Gonzaga, hails from the historically impotent West Coast Conference. Now, more than ever, any team has a shot at cutting down the nets.Unfortunately for Crimson fans, the numbers also show that this Harvard team isn’t nearly as dominant as those other Ancient Eight squads. While the three previous squads had average margins of victory of over eight and a half points a game, this Crimson squad checks in with nearly half that at four and a half. Ranked 151st of the country in defensive efficiency according to stats guru Kem Pomeroy, the Crimson rank near the bottom of all of college basketball in every rebounding category.The saving grace of this Harvard team is its ability to fill the basket up in a hurry – a handy skill come March. With the second best true shooting percentage – a metric measuring a team’s overall shooting ability—in the nation, Harvard can shoot with anyone. The ability to make threes can take lower seeded teams deep in the tournament.  Just ask Stephen Curry’s Davidson squad, Brad Stevens’ Butler teams, or even Jeff Foote’s Cornell team.With no rotation player larger than 6-8, the Crimson will inevitably be smaller than its on-court opponents. Like they have been all year, the team will be underdogs fighting upward battles. This team wasn’t supposed to be here. Now that it is, history and the magic of the three may prove its saving graces.—Staff writer David Freed can be reached at davidfreed@college.harvard.edu. Follow her on Twitter @CrimsonDPFreed.

Rock guitarists have all the fun. They get to stand at the front of the stage with the lead singer and play flashy solos—which are run through about eight different electronic filters)—and bask in the light of their fans’ adoration. Drummers and bass players, on the other hand, have to stand in the background and look mournfully out to the crowd, hoping that some girl might look past the frontman’s unbridled machismo and notice the sensitive soul laying down beats toward the back.This wasn’t always the case. Back in the heady days of soul music, while the lead singers were busting out some fly, synchronized dance in the front, the guitarist and the bassist were standing together. Bassists, drummers, and guitarists were equals, all working together to lay down the foundation of the song. Guitarists didn’t get solos. Like all the other musicians, they would get a “break”—a couple of measures—in the song to do their thing before melting back into the rest of the band.This is what makes Eddie Floyd’s “Big Bird” so unusual. It is above all else a guitar song, driven by the sort of guitar licks and chord progressions usually found in rock ‘n’ roll. The guitar plays exposed riffs a total of four times throughout the track, and the horns—which have most of the best solos in the soul catalog—actually let the guitars have all the limelight on “Big Bird,” acting for the most part to support the other instruments in the rhythm section. It is the guitarist’s big moment, and even for a musician as accomplished as Booker T. Jones—of Booker T. and the M.G.’s’ fame—the recognition must have been nice.Before I continue, I have to own up to a couple of things. First of all, unlike the other songs I’ve written about in this column, “Big Bird” was actually released as a single—by Stax Records in 1967—even if it was a commercial flop. Also, this song wasn’t cruelly underappreciated. In fact, it has been covered by numerous artists, including seminal English punk rockers The Jam, and has enjoyed a cult following in the UK. The reason this song is worth discussing is because it marks a watershed moment in the history of soul music. Soul music—especially in the early to mid ‘60s—often fell victim to appropriation by white artists like Pat Boone, who scored hits by covering the work of black artists. Even artists like The Beatles did the same thing, even though, to their credit, they took the time to acknowledge the genius of the artists they were covering.Soul music tends to be a little formulaic, but this song draws very heavily from the guitar-driven rock that was flooding the airwaves in the late ‘60s. However, what is so interesting about a song like “Big Bird” is how syncretic it is. “Big Bird” is still definitely a soul song, but one that is actually in conversation with music by the likes of the Kinks and the Dave Clark Five. In fact, it was written by Floyd in London—incidentally while he waiting in an airport to fly back to the states for Otis Redding’s funeral—the home of blues-infused rock music pioneered by artists such as the Rolling Stones.
It starts with a meandering, sliding guitar riff, quickly doubled by the rhythm guitarist. Soon, the drums and saxes come in and kick the song up to a whole other level of intensity. Just as suddenly as they emerged, they fall back and let Booker Washington set the tone for the verse with a bluesy chord progression that sounds like it came straight from a Howlin’ Wolf classic. “Big Bird” has all the bells and whistles normally associated with soul music—such as punchy sax solos and call-and-response vocal harmonies—but unlike most of Floyd’s other works, the engine of the song is the omnipresent guitar, which drives the song along in a distinctly rock ‘n’ roll way.One of the hardest things for any artist to do is to mesh two different styles without compromising the integrity of either one. “Big Bird” is an example of precisely how this should be done. It is full of rock elements, but never once sounds like anything but a soul song. It captures both rock’s hard edge and soul’s lushness. And for once, Booker T. Washington got to share the spotlight with the lead singer and play a soul song that is actually worthy of a guitarist of his abilities. His mother must have been proud.—Columnist Noah S. Guiney can be reached at nguiney@college.harvard.edu.

On Harvard’s most important weekend of basketball to date, it was a freshman that rose to the occasion.Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers has guided the Crimson offense all season, but his clutch plays down the stretch against Columbia and efficient three-point shooting against Cornell helped earn Harvard (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) its third straight Ivy League Championship and second outright title.Chambers went five-of-six from the field for 16 points in the Crimson’s 56-51 win over the Lions (12-14, 4-9).  After a Princeton loss to Yale on Friday gave Harvard a chance to clinch at least a share of the Ivy title, Saturday’s match-up against the Big Red (13-18, 5-9) became that much more important. Chambers stepped up in the spotlight, hitting three-of-four from downtown on his way to a 16-point, five-assist night in a 65-56 victory over Cornell.With Princeton’s loss to Brown later that evening, the Crimson earned its second straight bid to the NCAA tournament.After trailing for most of the night against a Columbia team that beat Harvard by 18 on its home court, Chambers put the Crimson up for good with 40 seconds to go off of an acrobatic and-one lay-up.  Taking the rebound from sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi, Chambers pushed the ball up the court one-on-four before hitting the tying lay-up and go-ahead free throw.
“[Harvard coach Tommy Amaker] had told us that if we got a rebound off of a miss he wanted us to come down and try and get something early in transition,” Chambers said. “Steve grabbed the rebound and got it to me, and then I saw a little crease and took it.”The Crimson trailed 28-20 going into halftime, but an eight-nothing run capped off by a Chambers steal and ensuing lay-up tied the game at 30-all. The Lions maintained a slight advantage over Harvard until the final minute of the game.The Crimson struggled from beyond the arc against Columbia, only going three-for-11. However, Harvard made up for it by hitting 15 free throws on the night, with Chambers leading the way going six-for-seven from the charity stripe.“[Siyani] is a great playmaker, and he gets us open shots,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “And if we have open shots, we should probably be making them.”While the Crimson may have struggled with the deep ball on Friday, it was the key to Harvard’s victory on Saturday against the Big Red. The team shot nine-of-15 on the night for an outstanding 60 percent from beyond the arc.  Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard hit four from deep on the night, with three coming in the first half. Chambers, not to be outdone, hit all three of his shots from beyond the arc in the second half.The Crimson ended the first period on a nine-to-one run, with a nifty lefty layup from Chambers as time expired to make it 32-24.The home squad was able to maintain a double-digit lead throughout most of the second half, finding a large portion of its success from downtown. Co-captain Christian Webster, Rivard, and Chambers all hit from deep to help the Crimson keep its advantage.After a Cornell layup dwindled the lead down to 57-50 with 4:30 to go, it became a game of free throws.  Harvard scored its final eight points on free throws from sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, Rivard, and Chambers.“I’m proud of our guys,” Amaker said. “We are an incredibly young team and to talk about Siyani in his first year in our program and all the other freshman to be a part of this. We hope this can be big part of moving forward.”Just a year removed from playing high school ball for Hopkins Sr. High, Chambers has adjusted quickly to the college game after being thrust into the starting lineup.  Chambers leads the Ivy League in assists, averaging 5.7 per game, a mark also good enough for first place nationally among college freshmen. The point guard is sixth in the conference in scoring with 12.9 per game and was a nominee for the Bob Cousy award that goes to the best point guard in the country.While most television personalities like to refer to true freshman as inexperienced during the NCAA tournament, Chambers, according to both his statistics and Amaker, does not fall into that category.Chambers has started all 28 games for the Crimson this season—one that included a very strong non-conference schedule and the always-competitive Ivy League. Not only has Chambers started every contest, but he averages 37.8 minutes a game, placing him first in the Ivy League and fourth in the nation.“Certainly Siyani’s shots seemed to be incredibly timely,” Amaker said. “At the end of the half and the threes, he’s been just timely for us an awful lot this year.”

Logan E. Leslie, current Harvard freshman and former active-duty Green Beret, told The Crimson Monday that he plans to seek a seat on Cambridge’s City Council. If elected, the 26-year-old, who lives off-campus with his wife and daughter, would be the first Harvard College student on the Council in recent memory.Leslie said he hopes to represent a student voice on the Council and make an effort to involve students in the Cambridge community.“There are a lot of young leaders here,” Leslie said. “They’re passionate. It’s a loss for the town not to try to involve them.”After completing two combat tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, Leslie is now studying at Harvard on the GI Bill. He said he considers himself both a Cantabrigian and a university student, adding that he plans to live in Cambridge for the foreseeable future with his wife and daughter.Leslie has identified three main goals that will form the crux of his political platform: improving safety, bringing “common-sense leadership” to the Council, and strengthening university-community relations. Leslie said he believes there is currently a “disconnect” between the city of Cambridge and its university students, and hopes to introduce programming that would involve university students in the community, such as paid internships in local government or subsidies for summer housing.
Leslie said he hopes students will help bolster him to victory in the fall.“This is where they live right now. This is their community,” he said of students. “It would be nice to get them registered to have a voice on the City Council.”Leslie would not be the first university student to seek to represent the student voice.In 2009, Leland Cheung, who was then completing a dual-degree at the Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management, ran for City Council. He won, becoming the first University student and the first Asian-American to sit on the Council.According to Robert Winters, a local political commentator and an instructor at the Harvard Extension School, Cheung won in 2009 with considerable support from Cambridge’s student population. When he ran for re-election in 2011, however, it was Cambridge’s Asian population that was his loyal voting bloc, Winters said.Winters said he believes that bringing University students to the polls for City Council elections is difficult because much of what the Council addresses is not directly relevant to students’ lives.“Most of what they are focusing on is not really going to resonate,” Winters said. “It’s always been a bad calculation to count on too many student votes.”Leslie expressed a desire to garner votes from the Cambridge community, but also emphasized the importance of the student bloc.“I would like to impress upon students how important their support is,” Leslie said. “I want to impress the relevance of this; this is the most grassroots level of government.”—Staff writer Sonali Y.

I. Glenn Cohen will ascend in the ranks of Harvard Law School’s faculty this summer as its newest tenured professor, bringing with him expertise on the legal aspects of healthcare and bioethics.“I’m excited, honored, and happy to be here for the foreseeable future,” said Cohen, who became an assistant professor at HLS in 2008 and co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics in 2009.“He’s an amazing professor,” said Benjamin N. Roin, assistant professor at HLS, who works with Cohen as the other co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center. “You go to the classroom and see that he’s really dynamic. I think he’s a great teacher who loves his students.”Cohen said that he looks forward to “more book writing, more book editing, and maybe down the road, a new course” in his new position. He has been in discussions about a potential healthcare law course that would be a collaboration between the Law School, Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School. The class is still in a developmental stage.In the meantime, Cohen expects his course load to remain about the same, and he anticipates teaching courses in bioethics and health law, including one that discusses the intersection of bioethics and film. Furthermore, he will continue in his position as co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center.
“He’s such a fascinating scholar,” Roin said. “He’s really interested in the puzzling questions surrounding health, law, and medicine. His medical ethics class is always over-enrolled.”Cohen’s main research interests lie in the fields of reproductive technology, medical tourism, and issues common to both doctors and lawyers. Cohen was chosen as a Radcliffe Institute Fellow this year with a focus on medical tourism.“There are so many interesting things going on with health reform and the healthcare debate,” he said. “It’s very current, which I like.”Amidst growing concern among Law School students over employment after graduation, Cohen said that bioethics and the legal aspect of healthcare have strong growth prospects.“The Affordable Care Act is a great insurance opportunity for lawyers,” he said. “The law school, I think, ultimately does hope to bring in more healthcare faculty members.”Roin said that given the large role of the healthcare industry in the U.S. economy, this growth in health law was “inevitable.”“The healthcare system interacts with the legal system in a whole bunch of different ways,” he said. “You can’t get away from it anymore.”—Staff writer Dev A.

By the time the importance of returning borrowed Tupperware is discussed for the third time, it’s quite easy to forget that “Dead Man Down” is supposed to be an action thriller. The fact that “Dead” is director Niels Arden Oplev’s first American feature film is no excuse; after all, one would expect the mastermind behind the 2009 Swedish adaptation of “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” to be an expert in this genre. However, Oplev is not solely to blame; rather, J.H. Wyman, who also created the recently finished FOX TV series “Fringe,” is at fault for coming up with a script that causes so much eye-rolling that one may wonder if “Dead” is intended to be a comedy.  The action sequences and the screenplay of the film are both lackluster, and the unfortunate combination of the two ultimately weighs down much of the movie, making “Dead” an extremely unpleasant viewing experience.Despite its moderately intriguing and suspenseful setup, “Dead” struggles with cheesy plot twists and ludicrous dialogue. Victor (Colin Farrell) is a brooding and introverted hitman in the midst of exacting revenge when he is confronted by his neighbor, Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), who harbors a borderline obsessive crush on him. A woman with prominent scars on her face as a result of a drunk-driving accident, Beatrice eventually asks him out on what is unintentionally probably the most listless first date in movie history, filled with lifeless small talk comparable to a conversation in an online speed dating forum. However, the action finally picks up speed as Beatrice unexpectedly blackmails Victor to force him to murder the driver responsible for her agony.From the very beginning, it seems extremely unlikely that the two will fall in love given the incredibly unromantic setup. The lack of chemistry between Farrell and Rapace also prevents the audience from believing their strained love story. It almost seems like Beatrice’s constant presence in Victor’s life is the sole reason that the moody henchman begins to fall for the very woman that blackmailed him only a couple of days earlier. Compounding this situation is dialogue so awkward that the only reaction it evokes is shuddering. With ridiculous lines like “I’ll just set this between the mustard and the plastic explosives,” spoken by Beatrice to Victor as she adoringly stocks his fridge for him, the preposterous writing makes it hard to take the film seriously.Despite being highly stylized, the action sequences of “Dead” are as cheesy as the dialogue. Oplev misuses slow motion to create anticlimactic and overwrought shootouts and car chases that are reminiscent of  cartoons. There almost seems to be a correlation in the movie between weapon size and temper: the bigger the gun, the angrier the attacker. In addition, Victor’s apparent invincibility to the bullets of the dozen henchmen he kills pulls the film from realism into fantasy. The unbelievability of the action scenes throughout the movie escalates to the point that by the end, the film seems farcical in its attempt to remain relatable to the audience.The only thing stopping “Dead” from becoming just another mindless action movie is the strategic casting of Rapace. Having already worked with Rapace in “Dragon Tattoo,” Oplev understandably takes full advantage of this experience and thereby allows Rapace to outshine the rest of her cast by placing few distractions in each of her scenes. Beatrice appears wretched and sympathetic after she returns home from the hospital free of stitches, but full of shame and inner rage. Rapace expertly brings Beatrice to life and effectively conveys her character’s raw pain by portraying her with inward shoulders and fatigued expressions. Her performance is the one redeeming part of an otherwise terrible movie.
While supposedly both an action thriller and a love story, the movie fails to do either genre justice because of a poorly written and confusing script. If only the film focused on just one of these directions, perhaps it could have been an enjoyable experience, especially given the talents of Rapace. Instead, “Dead Man Down” amounts to nothing more than an exercise in vapidity and convolution.—Staff writer Connie Yan can be reached at connieyan@college.harvard.edu.

A delegation of workers at the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston, which is housed in a Harvard-owned building, presented hotel management with a petition Monday delcaring worker intentions to start the process of considering unionization.The petition, which was signed by a majority of the hotel’s workers, outlines their desire to be able to decide without the influence of hotel management whether or not to join UNITE HERE! Local 26—the same union that represents Harvard’s dining hall workers.“We demand that the owner, Harvard University, and management of the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston, respect our signatures and agree to a fair process for us to decide whether to have union representation without management interference and intimidation,” the workers wrote in the petition, which they presented to the DoubleTree’s general manger Monday afternoon.Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, said he is hopeful that the University will work to accommodate the workers’ wishes. He praised the way the University treated Harvard Law School dining hall workers when they went through the process of joining UNITE HERE! Local 26 in December 2011.“Our union has a very mature and rational relationship with Harvard,” Lang said. “Given Harvard’s track record at the Law School last year where things were done in a very professional and amicable manner, we don’t see why a similar thing can’t happen at the DoubleTree Hotel.”
A Harvard spokesperson could not be reached for comment about the petition Monday afternoon.Boston City Councilor At-Large Felix G. Arroyo accompanied the delegation to present the petition and spoke with the workers afterwards.“We’re going to win because of your leadership,” Arroyo said before a crowd of DoubleTree employees. “Members are what make a union strong.”Representatives from Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement and dining hall workers who are members of UNITE HERE! Local 26 at Harvard also accompanied the hotel employees.“As students at a University that owns the hotel and pretty much sets policy there, we have a responsibility to back [the workers] up and give them the support they need for a very legitimate cause,” said Ikaika Bayley ’16, a student who showed up to demonstrate his support.Harvard purchased the DoubleTree Suites, located in Allston across the river from the University’s main campus, in January 2005.—Staff writer Christine Y.

“What  happiness it would be to cry,” Eurydice sighs forlornly, robbed of her  memories after arriving on the shores of Hades. Her character is the  focus of Sarah Ruhl’s modern take on the Greek myth of Orpheus and  Eurydice, which plays at the Loeb Ex through Friday. While Ruhl  transplants the story to modern times, her script preserves the poetic  style of Ovid’s millennia-old version. Such a choice means that from the  mouths of the wrong actors, the play’s lines could come across as  forced and impossibly overwrought. But this production’s cast, deftly  directed by Madeleine F. Bersin ’14, is more than up to the task of  breathing life and emotion into Ruhl’s script, delivering a performance  that is quietly heartrending.Ruhl’s  retelling of the classic Greek myth places the emphasis not on Orpheus  (Bryan D. Kauder ’14), the famed muse-born musician, but on his wife  (Laura J. A. Trosser ’16). Tempted away from her wedding party by the  Nasty Interesting Man (Alistair A. Debling ’16), Eurydice realizes too  late that he wants to rape her and falls to her death while attempting  to flee. From there, she is transported to the underworld and forced to  shed all memory of her previous life. Her father (Benjamin J. Lorenz  ’14) greets her at the shores of the river Styx and must bear the task  of slowly, painstakingly teaching her to remember. Delivered with  genuine tenderness and infinite patience, Lorenz’s performance provides a  beautiful counterpoint to that of Trosser, whose Eurydice is often  reduced to tears of frustration and confusion as she tries but fails to  reconstruct her past. In one scene, Eurydice comes across a book that  Orpheus sends her; startled, she screams at it before trying to “read”  it with her feet. Yet Trosser’s Eurydice is affecting, not clownish;  Trosser takes on a wide-eyed innocence that makes her character more  sympathetic. Her and Lorenz’s relationship is delicately rendered: in  one of the play’s most touching scenes, Eurydice, gently encouraged by  her father, attempts to read, sheepishly at first, but then gaining  confidence. While the original myth focuses on the relationship between  Eurydice and Orpheus, Ruhl’s version is much more centered around the  father-daughter relationship, and Trosser and Lorenz carry the play with  their poignant portrayals.As  well as the sustaining power of paternal love, this production of  “Eurydice” also explores romantic attraction. Rather than going for  histrionics, Kauder reads out Orpheus’s letters to his deceased wife  with understated emotion. Kauder’s portrayal of their love is frank but  not overblown, and all the more affecting for it. His love is simple,  natural, yet still acutely felt—he does not have to shout to the heavens  to convey the depth of his grief. And as the ruler of the underworld  (as well as the Nasty Interesting Man), Debling embodies lust. His  obsession with Eurydice is made creepy by his childishness. Wheeling in  on a tricycle, snapping his suspenders emphatically, and prancing around  like an overgrown toddler, Debling skillfully plays up the physical  comedy of his part while still maintaining an air of menace. Set  designers Heather D. Mauldin ’14 and Madelynne A. Hays ’13 created a  kind of industrial hellscape: pipes jut up from the ground of an  otherwise desolate set. There are two tiers on top of each other; the  one above represents  the land of the living, while down below is Hades.  Such a division allows for scenes to be enacted on both levels  simultaneously, to great effect. Orpheus and Eurydice’s joyful wedding  dance, for example, is mirrored eerily by the bride’s dead father down  below, who dances all alone. The costuming embodied the essence of each  character: costume designer Allison A. Ray ’14 chose to outfit Trosser  in Mary Janes, ruffled socks, and a bow to play up Eurydice’s childlike  innocence. The ruler of the underworld appears decked out in short  shorts and a striped tank top to exaggerate his off-puttingly juvenile  portrayal. The father’s costuming was fitting as well, and portrayed him  as a mature parental figure—he wore a tweed vest and pants, looking  like he’d stepped out of a sepia-tinged photograph.Bersin’s  production of “Eurydice” gives viewers a tender and multi-faceted  portrait of love and loss, and though Ruhl’s script focuses on the pain  of losing one’s memories, the cast delivers a performance not to be  forgotten.

UPDATED: March 12, 2013, at 4:38 p.m.University President Drew G. Faust was kept in the dark about the secret administrative search of resident deans’ email accounts to trace the origin of a media leak, she said in a statement Monday.The covert search of email accounts was part of a broader investigation to identify who was responsible for leaking an internal email sent between administrators about the Government 1310 cheating case. The search was authorized by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and the University’s General Counsel, with the support of Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.Faust’s statement gave few details about what she did or did not know.“Back in September, I was made aware that there was concern about a potential breach in the confidentiality of the process, and was told it had been resolved. But I was not informed of specifics,” she said in the statement.
A University official confirmed that Faust was not told of the subject-line search of emails.In her statement, Faust said that after speaking to Smith and Hammonds, she believed that administrators had taken the necessary steps to protect student and Administrative Board confidentiality.“I feel very comfortable that great care was taken to safeguard the privacy of all concerned, especially our students,” the statement said.The question of whether Harvard broke its own privacy policies rests on whether resident deans’ email accounts are governed by the email privacy policy for faculty or staff—a distinction that FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to clarify.The <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:VY4vMC670QUJ:www.security.harvard.edu/files/Security_-_Faculty%2520Privacy%2520Advisory%25205.13.10.doc+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShJlNAJYhCt8gEyqxRoLhVCkWs7jwvrpID5dZ5ASGriyNsJuq7wPDiJ6IEAFgXLZb2MP9wjkuzrTO-KyCl6Kpb4b5GlDvWOW2uW6GwxoBtmVZB5_jcnRkkYy0EaV2FqW7Vykp9o&amp;sig=AHIEtbQdz4AABsKpX-GaHDTuSZVlzwsAqA"">faculty policy allows for searches of emails, but only when notice is given to the account owners. If this policy applies to the email accounts of resident deans, Harvard would have violated its rules.The staff policy, on the other hand, allows administrators to access electronic files of non-faculty “at any time” and “for any business purpose” without requesting permission. If resident deans’ email accounts fall under the staff policy, Harvard would have remained consistent with its policies.In her statement, Faust said the searches prompt legitimate questions about whether administrators were right to access accounts without prior notification.“I share the view that questions about whether more resident deans should have been informed sooner are fair to ask,” Faust said. “And I believe that debates about the rights and responsibilities of members of our community are healthy.”When asked about Faust’s statement, mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid, a vocal critic of Harvard’s handling of the cheating scandal and its fallout, said he had no doubt that Harvard acted within legal bounds in authorizing the search.Still, he raised questions about the factors that influenced the decision regarding what to tell Faust.“Obviously they must have had some misgivings if this became known,” Schmid said.He added, “They certainly realized that if this became public, there might be quite a bit of negative faculty reaction.”—Staff writer Nicholas P.

Italian-born conductor Federico Cortese has branched out from his family of diplomats and his law degree: he has performed with some of the most esteemed orchestras in the world and has travelled everywhere from Houston to Sydney as a guest conductor. He now heads the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra and the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and he teaches a class on conducting at Harvard. The former music director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Cortese has conducted at the Tanglewood Music Festival, the Spoleto Festival in Florence, the Finnish National Opera, and numerous other festivals all over the globe.The Harvard Crimson: Why did you decide to become a conductor?Federico Cortese: I’m ashamed to say it, but I’m afraid I decided to become a conductor for all the wrong reasons. It’s a particularly common boy’s disease—in this, girls are much wiser. I think that we boys develop this interest based on the misconception that when you’re up there, you lead—you’re the boss, and you make sound just by moving your hands—all of which is all wrong, totally wrong. The reality is very different. When you’re up there, no one is looking up at you. People are much less impressed by your movements. You’re not making any music—the orchestra is making music and you’re trying to lead it in the direction that you want, provided you know how to lead it and where to lead it to.THC: What is it like to conduct versus to teach conducting?FC: Conducting is borderline impossible to teach. It’s the result of years of experience. There are some basic things—how to beat a four-four, how to stay clear in your beat—but these are pretty trivial…. So we try to present the students with what will later on be the challenges of being a conductor: the understanding of the score, the knowledge of the style, so that when you start [conducting], you’re not just beating—you have an idea of the sound. The beating is just a function of it. Otherwise, it’s like teaching poetry by giving basic grammar lessons…. About conducting: I don’t think that many HRO people realize it, but when we are making music together, there is no difference between the students and the conductor.... It’s their performance as much as mine. When I am with HRO, I really feel we are in the same boat. When I teach, we are in two different boats. The goal is not to make something together—the goal is to try to teach something to the students and develop the qualities they already have.
THC: You studied law as well as music. How have you used your law degree?FC: The degree is sitting in my drawer somewhere—I have no idea where it is. I think it’s in Rome, but I’m not sure.THC: Is there anything you’d like to add?FC: One thing: I do think that always, everything in life...HRO, and to some extent the experiments I am doing with music performance classes, are always a work in progress. So I never take the rules of the past as the only possible way. You certainly need to start from that—you don’t want to break traditions—but you need to update things. You need to find ways to better serve not just the musicians, but the community at Harvard and in general. I am trying to find ways so that music-making can become more relevant in the life of the students, and not just a little hobby.

For writers at work, punctuation can slip from a matter of convention to one of obsession. I just finished my poetry thesis last week, and I’m embarrassed to admit the number of times I changed periods to commas, replaced colons with dashes, and struck out semicolons—only to routinely second-guess my revisions. An ill-placed period felt as dangerous as stopping the car on the highway, while a missing colon felt like pummeling through a scenic pass without the requisite anticipatory pause.The comparison of a speck of ink to the brakes on a 4,000 pound vehicle might sound extreme, but my devotion to punctuation is hardly radical on the spectrum. Hungarian novelist Péter Nádas, a far more esteemed (if less jovial) grammarian than myself, once grew so distressed about the authenticity of his punctuation that he claimed to want to die. His contemporary author László Krasznahorkai professed to avoiding periods because “periods are for God.” In my favorite authorial statement on punctuation, German theorist Theodore Adorno stares into these small black dots and sees history flicker: “It is history, far more than meaning for grammatical function, that looks out at us, rigidified and trembling slightly, from every mark of punctuation,” he writes.These writers’ fervor for punctuation led me to wonder about the story of our symbols. Where were these tiny markings born? How did they crawl into the spaces between words on pages worldwide? My quest for answers (a journey that led me from the front to back of M.B. Parkes’ “Pause and Effect: An Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West”) yielded an explanation that reached into antiquity, matured in the Middle Ages, and solidified with the status of the printing press.The astonishing truth is that punctuation is not as old as the written word. In classical times, the oral literary tradition sidestepped the need for punctuation. Authors wrote according to the Greek method of “scriptio continua” (continuous text), and orators gleaned the topography of finished writing through preparatory readings that revealed pauses and pronunciations. Texts were meant to be delivered aloud, and sight-reading was uncommon practice. At most, scribes would insert indentations or differentiate first letters of new paragraphs; teachers known as “Grammatici” might incorporate hyphens or long-vowel marks while assisting their pupils. Romans dabbled with periods in the first century, but even they soon reverted back to “scriptio continua”, relying on Latin syntax alone to imply questions and quotations.With the rise of Christianity, punctuation took on new life. Monasteries housed monks who began to read for the purpose of individual education rather than rhetorical performance. Silent reading became more popular, and punctuation grew significant for shedding light on the meaning of religious texts. In the sixth century, Archbishop Isidore of Seville even wrote a guide ranking punctuation symbols in order of importance. By the time Anglo-Saxon scribes started recording Latin texts in the eighth century, punctuation marks were cropping up in texts with regularity. An ivy leaf was used to separate text from commentary, a mark called the “diple” (&gt;) indicated quotations, and scores shaped like “7” functioned as commas.
The advent of the printing press in the 15th century set punctuation on a path to uniformity. New Roman became the default typeface, and with it the comma, parentheses, and semi-colon rose to prominence. As printers tried to fit text into specific page dimensions, punctuation marks like the apostrophe were introduced for abbreviation. These new conventions spread as swiftly as the printed books they populated.The significance of each mark congealed into its set meaning, and writers could start to manipulate punctuation as craftwork. Authors began using punctuation not only to add grammatical clarity, but to shape their arguments and characterize their style. The nuances that punctuation captured gave way to the beautiful 17th-century idea that punctuation, as much as language, mirrors the structure of thought—hence the doggedness we see in contemporary writers shaping their sentences.It seems easy to dismiss writers’ obsessions with punctuation as a retreat from reality. In the physical world, what matters about one minuscule pen mark on a paper sheet? My conceit, based on months of crafting my poetry thesis and a few hours researching punctuation history, is that this minuscule pen mark does matter. Punctuation brings writers one step closer to representing reality in all the detail they perceive. Periods, commas, and colons are the fine-edged tools writers need to contour the voice they want the world to hear. When we treat writing not only as a structure of pages, paragraphs, sentences, and words, but also as a patchwork of punctuation marks, reality can celebrate for having another level of gradation revealed through language.—Columnist Stephanie L. Newman can be reached at stephanienewman@college.harvard.edu.

  On Saturday, the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra tackled the latest in a series of ambitious programs, performing Leonard Bernstein’s Overture to “Candide”, as well as “Short Ride in a Fast Machine” by John Adams ’71 and Johannes Brahms’s 4th Symphony. While the consistent brilliance of the HRO’s string section made for an enjoyable, impressive performance,  the brass and wind sections at times failed to match the strings’ dynamic ability and technical precision, holding the orchestra back from its full potential.The concert began with a near-perfect rendition of Bernstein’s Overture. Through precise control of dynamics, HRO conductor Federico Cortese guided the orchestra’s performance toward a playful mood rather than a bombastic or overwrought one—a decision that made the piece even more enjoyable. The strings effortlessly alternated between soaring crescendos, intricate pizzicato, and, most impressively, the blisteringly rapid unison runs that make up the Overture’s Theme, which are difficult play accurately for even the most experienced performers. Although short and familiar, the Overture is a deceptively difficult piece, and the HRO dazzled through nuanced interpretation and accomplished technical execution.The second composition on the program, Adams’ “Short Ride in a Fast Machine,” was less successful. A quality performance of the piece depends heavily on the brass section’s ability to build dynamic tension and to articulate rhythmic dissonance through rapid, distinct pulses. However, throughout the majority of the performance, the HRO’s brass was muddled, robbing the piece of its rhythmic tension. In the normally inspiring finale, the brass was simply too soft to rise above the other sections and provide the requisite drama. Adams’ work is challenging to perform, more so than that of his minimalist contemporaries Philip Glass and Steve Reich because it hinges on engrossing the listener with precisely-balanced musical textures.  Although the rendition of the piece was generally good, it was not quite at the level of a professional performance. Compared to the San Francisco Symphony, which is well known for its successful renditions of Adams’ compositions, the HRO’s rendition of the composer’s dramatic style fell short.

While the first two pieces lasted only about eight minutes, the final work, Brahms’ Symphony No. 4 in E minor, lasted over 40. Although technically accomplished, the HRO’s performance lagged in the less riveting and emotionally powerful sections of the Symphony. For example, during the symphony’s least intense movement, the second, the HRO sounded drowsy and disinterested, as if its performers were merely waiting to get to the monumental fourth movement, during which the orchestra regained its energy and delivered a rousing finale. Even within single movements, this problematic trend remained; the loud, dramatic sections were expertly managed, but the performance would have benefited if much more attention had been invested in capturing the emotions found in the softer sections.The gap in musicianship and technical skill between the strings and the rest of the orchestra persisted throughout the symphony. The strings were mostly excellent throughout, even providing some jaw-dropping moments such as the wonderfully formed interplay between the violins and cellos during the third movement. However, the brass and wind sections were missing the same overall level of precision. At times, their collective timing felt disjointed; at others, their lack of dynamic range contributed to the performance’s drowsy feel.While the issues with the brass were problematic, they were not fatal to the concert. Rather, they merely kept a very good performance of the symphony from becoming an excellent one.—Staff writer Will Holub-Moorman can be reached at holubmoorman@college.harvard.edu.

I love you. I can see myself in your eyes, and it’s not just the reflection of my white face in your black pupils. Simple as that. Not many things are, but this is black and white.We loved each other for a whole night, didn’t we? Well, I guess it wasn’t really even the night, was it? A morning, and only part of one, but the best part—the between- midnight-and-getting-out-of-bed part, the things that happen in the dark-fades-to-light hours.I loved you the first time we spoke. It was at your party during that black night in your gray apartment on your white couch in my black-and-white dress when I wanted nothing more than to lie in your white room on your white bed and stare at the white ceiling and make gray clouds and think black thoughts with you.We were drunk at the bar on that night we loved and I don’t quite know how we left together, but we did and proceeded to blacken our lungs outside under gray clouds. I opened your door easily, the one where the key sticks, a little trick of mine from a door I’d once known. You smiled as I entered your world. You  showed me your drawings, excited to share, but I remembered them all from before—the wrinkly man and the vase face and the boring fashion model you’d said you could draw in your sleep. I asked you about your writing that you’d told me about before but that you didn’t remember telling me about, because you don’t tell people those things. You blushed in surprise and it was sweet, like I thought your lips might be.I don’t know how it came to be that we kissed, but I wish that I did because it was lovely and I loved you there again on your couch. And I don’t know how we got to your bedroom, but I do remember being there and  you went down on me and I went up on you and we moved together like we were on the sea and it was perfect and I could have had sex with you forever.
We had cigarettes and music on your white couch in our black scraps of clothing and we kept not sleeping even though we should have. We got to bed eventually, holding each other strangely close in the black night. I saw you that night and I saw you again in the morning as I woke and rolled over to stare at your white ceiling from your white sheets and you pulled me back over in your half-sleep, which I enjoyed more than most things. I loved you then as I ran my hand through your black hair, listening to your heart beat. I told you I’d drawn you in a dream, the sharp lines of your face that highlight your mouth, I said how it was perfect and you said that I was.You are perfect in my head, where I can change the way things are to a certain this or that. I’ve loved you as the dream more than you as the man, the real man with undefinable shades of color. Life and having lived turns black and white to gray, but my heart and mind’s ache for absolutes has power over memory. Desire writes his name boldly over history. My romanticizing urge makes love out of lust, and it tells me this is true:I loved you then and now, and it is as simple as black and white.—Columnist Megan E. McKenzie can be reached at mckenzie@fas.harvard.edu.

Retired General Stanley A. McChrystal called upon Harvard students to serve their country on Monday night as part of a panel hosted by the Institute of Politics.McChrystal, former commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, was joined by Mayor Annise D. Parker of Houston, Texas, and Spencer T. Kympton, the President of The Mission Continues, an oganization committed to empowering veterans. Harvard Kennedy School student Daniel P. C. Feehan moderated the event, which was entitled “Ask What You Can Do For America’s Veterans”.During the event’s introduction, University President Drew. G. Faust addressed the crowd through a pre-recorded video message. In the clip, Faust pledged to promote a culture supportive of military service on Harvard’s campus, praising the relationship between what she termed “two of the United States’ great institutions.”In an interview with The Crimson after the event, McChrystal discussed the need for Harvard students to pursue public service.“I think the military of the future has to represent all the parts of society, socially, religiously,” he said. “There have to be more Harvard grads serving. There have to be more Yale grads serving. There’s got to be a good mix.”
McChrystal continued by stressing the importance of building a culture of duty in which students want to served their country.“You want people at Harvard to feel that this is a responsibility, [like] ‘Of course a percentage of us have to serve in the military.’”Although he highlighted the need for Harvard students in the armed forces, McChrystal emphasized that service expands beyond the military. “I think if you refer to someone in the service, they ought to be someone who is serving the nation, maybe in uniform, or maybe in some other way.”McChrystal also echoed the panelists’ discussion of the need for undergraduates, in particular, to join the armed forces. According to Feehan, the vast majority of veterans currently enrolled at Harvard University attend the graduate schools.“When you come to a place like [Harvard College], the first thing you want to do is hide the fact that you’re a service member because you want to fit in,” McChrystal said. “I think what we’ve got to do is ask undergraduate life to expand its horizon a little bit. Don’t think of freshman as 17, 18, and 19. Think of freshman as 17 to 28.”—Staff writer Dev A. Patel can be reached at devpatel@college.harvard.edu. Follow him on Twitter @dev_a_patel.

Mozart’s iconic Requiem in D Minor, written by the composer on his deathbed, has a gentle allure—a restfulness to which the Back Bay Chorale will respond with a collaboration between a 27-year-old rising composer and the Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney. On Sunday in Sanders Theatre, the Chorale will perform Mozart’s Requiem alongside Mohammed Fairouz’s new work “Anything Can Happen.” This will be the Boston premiere of the latter piece, which was co-commissioned by the Chorale and three other chorale groups, among them the Grinnell Singers at Grinnell College, where the piece was performed last year.“It’s complementary how [Fairouz’s] title says, ‘anything can happen,’ which could be rather daunting,” says Craig Hughes, the president of the Back Bay Chorale. “So our music director, Scott Jarrett, paired it with Mozart Requiem, which is a very comforting piece.”“Anything Can Happen” contains three poems by Heaney interspersed with Arabic passages chosen by Fairouz, who picked apocalyptic excerpts from the Injeel, the Arabic Christian bible. Fairouz then wrote music around these texts. For the singers, he wrote out Arabic transliteration and an English translation to help their pronunciation and understanding.The piece also connects time periods. The final movement is a setting of Heaney’s poem “Anything Can Happen,” which is related to September 11. In writing the poem Heaney was inspired by an ancient Roman poet, Horace. “So, it goes back thousands of years, but it is very strangely resonant with the events of 9/11,” Hughes says.The concert features two soloists. The baritone vocal soloist, David Kravitz, has just premiered in an opera, “Clemency”; the solo violist, Roger Tapping, currently on the faculty of the New England Conservatory, has just been appointed the violist of the Juilliard String Quartet.
Hughes says the piece is meant as a fusion of diverse influences. “You’ve got these cross-cultural elements across West and East, but also music across time.”

Support for the State of Israel, once a matter of consensus among American Jews, is now the most divisive issue in the Jewish community. The weakening of support for Israel among many young American Jews is real and significant, while the reasons for this trend are complex and multifaceted.I’m not talking about unaffiliated Jews; they are distancing from Judaism in general, and their disengagement from Israel is merely a symptom of this larger phenomenon. Nor am I focused on the Orthodox community, where staunch support for the Jewish state remains the norm.However a <a href=""http://jstreet.org/page/j-street-core-principles"">growing number of socially and politically <a href=""http://harvardpja.blogspot.com/p/about-us.html"">progressive Jews are becoming increasingly critical of Israel’s rightward shift. They feel that their commitment to Israel compels them to speak out against continued occupation and settlement growth, policies that they see as morally indefensible and that only serve to undermine Israel’s own strategic goals. Their support for Israel is inextricably tied to the pursuit of peace; for them, the need for a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and secure Israel’s future as a Jewish state is axiomatic.A new generation of Jews needs a new paradigm for supporting Israel: their advocacy is not only about defending Israel on campus, but also about challenging the status quo and working to make Israel a better, more perfect country. Young American Jews are grappling with difficult questions about Israel’s status as a Jewish and democratic state, Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians, and Israel’s state monopoly of religion, to name just a few. The one-dimensional pictures of Israel painted by advocacy organizations or the honeymoon experience of a ten-day Birthright trip are no longer sufficient to help students wrestle with the multilayered, chaotic montage of life in Israel today.The Jewish community should be engaging with this demographic—young Jews trying to make sense of their identities in the face of a complex reality in Israel—rather than pushing them away. We must foster an open environment that will encourage them to build more sophisticated and authentic relationships with Israel, teaching them to embrace Israel despite its imperfections.
Sadly, the mainstream Jewish community’s hypersensitivity towards efforts to delegitimize Israel is often extended to liberal Jewish groups (e.g. J Street). At Harvard, the <a href=""http://www.openhillel.org/harvard.php"">Open Hillel Campaign, a student-led initiative aiming to expand Hillel International’s guidelines on discussions about Israel, has been at the center of recent clashes between the Progressive Jewish Alliance and the Jewish community. There is always a double standard in the Jewish community when it comes to criticism of Israel: To criticize from the right is legitimate, but to criticize from the left is to stab Israel in the back. This is hypocritical and wrong. Most criticism of Israel—not all, but most—comes from a place of deep love and commitment. Just because left-leaning Jews are critical of the occupation does not mean that they’re anti-Israel; rather their critical engagement is an expression of commitment to securing Israel’s identity and future.That said, progressive Jews must also do more to mitigate the often-legitimate concerns of the Jewish community. They shouldn’t expect moral exceptionalism from Israelis in dealing with the realpolitik demands of sovereignty. Nor should they dismiss or legitimize efforts to undermine the moral and political foundations of the State of Israel (as opposed to the occupation). The rejectionist and zero-sum ethos of anti-Israel activists presents a significant threat not only to Israel’s future but to the viability of peace in the region as well. We need not look further than tactics like Israel Apartheid Week or campaigns to boycott Israel to see the destructiveness of activism focused more on demonizing the Other than on resolving the conflict.Nevertheless, stifling debate about Israel—no matter how prejudiced or uninformed—or marginalizing liberal Jewish voices is wrong and ultimately self-defeating. The Jewish community shouldn’t be afraid to engage in difficult conversations about Israel. Ideas should be tested in the open marketplace through rigorous intellectual debate and civil dialogue; that is the only effective way to discredit bad ideas and amplify good ones.To that end, the Jewish community should be just as invested in helping young Jews cultivate meaningful relationships with Israel as it is in defending the Jewish state. For a state will only endure—it will only remain relevant to Israelis and Jews around the world—if it can be defended not only militarily but also morally. Indeed, there is no inherent contradiction between the responsibility to defend Israel and the imperative to perfect it; the two are reciprocally linked: Defending the state is a necessary condition for perfecting it, just as a more perfect Israel will be easier to defend.If the American Jewish community does not promote a more nuanced and sophisticated conversation about Israel, if it does not actively change the way Israel is discussed on campuses and in communities, it risks alienating a growing number of young Jews. Make no mistake: The future of the Jewish community and the State of Israel depends upon securing the continued support of liberal and open-minded Jews.Yoav Schaefer '15 is a social studies concentrator in Adams House.

Poetry is often thought of as a textual artform, but it can also be a social experience. On Saturday, the artist and poet Jon Cotner, who is also a lecturer at the Pratt Institute, visited Harvard Square to lead a walk entitled “Spontaneous Society.” The walk was sponsored by the Woodberry Poetry Room at Harvard. Cotner, who is the author of “Ten Walks/Two Talks,”  a collection of dialogues and poems about walks in Manhattan, introduced the walk as an artistic piece and a personal journey for the individual walkers. According to Cotner, speech has an intense power to spread joy and to forge connections. A major theme of Cotner’s published work is the issue of humans becoming isolated units obsessed with controlling their environments, whether it be through their constant iPod soundtrack or other incessant digital engagement instead of physically social interaction. According to Cotner, the goal of the walk was to intervene and create a smile or a laugh and to amplify good vibes between the walkers and everyone with whom they came into contact. When people ignore the stimuli in their environment, they ignore the possibility of spontaneity, Cotner said. Cotner used a variety of tactics to encourage participants to change their perceptions of their environment. He began by suggesting that the walkers stretch their bodies to activate themselves in the space and the moment. The group stretched in front of Harvard Hall amidst the comers and goers in Harvard Yard. This exercise was intended to make the strangers feel more relaxed in each other’s company, Cotner said.To demonstrate the power of spontaneous interaction, he asked the participants to share a story about chance interactions with strangers, and each member of the group shared one such experience.  As the walk began, Cotner assigned each person lines to try out in various scenarios. Oliver D. Strand ’11, one of the participants on the walk, was to say to anyone carrying food, despite the pervasive chill in the air, “It’s a great day for a picnic!” If someone approached with a baby in a stroller, another participant was instructed to say to them, “That looks cozy!” If someone approached with two dogs, the response was to be “That’s a good-looking duo!” More dogs prompted “That’s a good-looking wolfpack!” This line was deployed to a homeless man who sat with his three furry companions.  While this was happening, a woman brought him a bag of food and wished him well. Cotner said that these lines were all intended to connect the person speaking them to his or her surroundings , to make them pause and acknowledge a fleeting moment in our fast-paced world.
During the 90-minute walk, the participants became progressively more successful at engaging with the people they encounter. Many things from their trials and errors at penetrating the fortresses of anonymity on the street. When trying to connect with other people, eye contact is critical, one of the participants observed. When breaking through a social wall by offering a line, one really must mean it—people can sense sincerity. In scanning the sidewalks and horizons for targets to deliver the lines to, the walkers were encouraged to truly pay attention to their presence in a social space. “You created smiles that didn’t exist before,” Cotner told the participants. Some of the participants mentioned that it was strange that while the goal was spontaneity, parts of the piece were ironically unspontaneous—the planned lines, scenarios, and its very status as a piece of art at all. Cotner explained that his method paved the way for true spontaneity as the walkers learned to slow down and appreciate the ease with which they could generate happiness. Though Cotner’s walks aim to blur the line between art and life, the lines he gave out were not particularly beautiful. However, they were very poetic in sentiment. According to Cotner, their sole purpose was to use an ephemeral moment to bring about a smile.“That’s a good spot for a text!” he said brightly to a woman fiddling with her phone on a street corner. “You nailed it!” She looked up, confused, and then she smiled and agreed. “Over the years I’ve developed a catalog of one-line utterances that are 99% effective in terms of replacing urban anonymity with affection,” Cotner said. “[This is like] sharing a D.I.Y. joy kit,”  Cotner said. After pausing to reflect on the experience of the walk, the participants, who were formerly strangers, parted with hugs.This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:CORRECTION: March 18, 2013Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the “Spontaneous Society” walk in Harvard Square was co-sponsored by Elastic City, an organization that commissions artists to create walks. In fact, Elastic City was not involved in the “Spontaneous Society” walk.

House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor called for improvements to the American education system in an address at the Institute of Politics Monday evening.“One of my priorities this Congress will be to move heaven and earth to fix our education system for the most vulnerable,” Cantor said, advocating for the charter school concept.But the news of the night came as a protest staged by a campaign led by the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition interrupted Cantor’s appearance. After the group refused requests by Institute of Politics moderator C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 to return to their seats and cease their chorus of, “Lift the ban”, they were escorted out of the forum by security personnel.Coalition members, who were not forcibly removed, primarily protested Cantor’s support for a two-year-old ban on federal funding of a needle exchange program that allows drug users to trade in dirty needles for new ones, thus preventing the spread of blood-borne diseases like HIV.When asked whether he would vote to lift the appropriations ban if it is brought back before Congress on March 27, Cantor said, “No, I won’t.”
To this, protesters replied, “Shame on you!” and began their chant of, “Lift the ban!”The coalition was participating in a campaign with Harvard Medical School students and members of local AIDS awareness group ACTUP/Boston.The protest launched when coalition member Darshali A. Vyas ’14 made the first statement of the post-speech discussion, asking fellow campaigners to stand up with her. After the delegation had risen, Vyas recounted Cantor’s last visit to the IOP, which the group also protested.During that visit, Cantor stated that the government did not have the money to fund certain AIDS research and treatment funding.Vyas said that after being escorted out, she and fellow demonstrators “chanted in front of the window until [HUPD] asked us to stop” and told them to move away from the Kennedy School’s Littauer Building.Indoors, Cantor continued to participate in the question and answer session, remarking that “As far as the activists who just left, it wouldn’t be Harvard without that.”Cantor’s address, which preceded the protest, focused primarily on federal spending cuts and the importance of medical advancements, something he said would be aided by improvements to the American education system.Cantor also discussed the need to fix the higher education system, saying that this issue was at the center of his conversation with University President Drew G. Faust earlier Monday morning.In addition to discussing general goals for the country during his speech, Cantor also stated his positions on a number of contentious political issues currently plaguing leaders in Washington. He stressed that mental health care reform deserves prominent attention in the gun control debate that has developed since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, pointing to Virginia’s response to the 2007 shooting at Virginia Technical University. After the shooting, the state mandated updates to its mental health databases, thus improving the gun-buyer background check system.—Staff writer Steven R.
